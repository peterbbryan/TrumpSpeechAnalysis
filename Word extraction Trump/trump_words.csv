wrong
direction
with

is
doing

absolutely
terrible
job
the

many
of

either
grossly
incompetent
word
that
more
and
more
people
are
using

different
agenda

which
could
be
possible
in
any
event
washington

broken
and
our
country
is
in
serious
trouble
and
total
disarray
very
simple
politicians
are
all
talk
no
action
they
are
all
talk
and
no
action
and
it
constant
it
never
ends
and
conservative
actually
very
conservative
and
republican
and
very
disappointed
by
our
republican
politicians
because
they
let
the
president
get
away
with
absolute
murder
you
see
always
oh
we
going
to
do
this
we
going
to
nothing
ever
happens
nothing
ever
happens
you
look
at
total
catastrophe
and
by
the
way
it
really
kicks
in
in
and
it
is
going
to
be
disaster
people

closing
up
shops
doctors

quitting
the
business
have
friend
of
mine
who
doctor
very
good
doctor
very
successful
guy

said
have
more
accountants
than
have
patients

he
needs

it
is
so
complicated
and
so
terrible
and
he
never
had
that
before
and
he
going
to
close
up
his
business
and
he
was
very
successful
guy
but
it
happening
more
and
more
look
at
with
billion
website
have
many
many
many
they
all
over
the
place
but
for
okay
now
everything
about
was
lie
it
was
filthy
lie
and
when
you
think
about
it
lies
mean
are
they
prosecuted
does
anyone
do
anything
and
what
are
the
republican
politicians
doing
about
it
he
lied
about
the
doctor
he
lied
about
every
aspect
you
can
keep
your
plan
and
you
all
heard
that
hundreds
of
times
that
like
the
real
estate
location
location
do
even
say
it
anymore
because
everybody
goes
location
location
but
you
have
heard
this
about
and
it
disgraceful
it
big
fat
horrible
lie
your
are
going
through
the
roof
you
not
going
to
get
unless
you
hit
by
an
army
tank
you
not
going
to
get
coverage
and
people
that
had
plans
that
they
loved
that
they
really
loved
do
have
those
plans
anymore
so
it
real
real
disaster
and
somebody
has
to
repeal
and
replace
and
they
have
to
do
it
fast
and
not
just
talk
about
it
now
we
have
to
build
fence
and
it
got
to
be
beauty
who
can
build
better
than
trump
build
it
what
do
build
build
nice
fences
but
build
great
buildings
fences
are
easy
believe
me
saw
the
other
day
on
television
people
just
walking
across
the
border
they
walking
the
military
is
standing
there
holding
guns
and
people
are
just
walking
right
in
front
coming
into
our
country
it
is
so
terrible
it
is
so
unfair
it
is
so
incompetent
and
we
do
have
the
best
coming
in
we
have
people
that
are
criminals
we
have
people
that
are
crooks
you
can
certainly
have
terrorists
you
can
certainly
have
islamic
terrorists
you
can
have
anything
coming
across
the
border
we
do
do
anything
about
it
so
would
say
that
if
run
and
if
win
would
certainly
start
by
building
very
very
powerful
border
again
the
politicians
talk
about
it
and
they
do
nothing
about
it
oh
everything
is
what
happens
nothing
get
sued
all
the
time
okay
run
big
business
you
know
always
said
it
very
very
hard
for
person
who
is
very
successful
have
done
so
many
deals
almost
all
of
them
have
been
tremendously
successful
you
see
that
when
file
my
statements
mean
you
will
see
you
will
be
very
proud
of
me
okay
but
always
said
and
said
it
strongly
it
very
hard
for
somebody
that
does
tremendous
numbers
of
deals
to
run
for
politics
run
for
political
office
any
office
let
alone
president
because
you
done
so
much
you
beaten
so
many
people
you
created
so
many
look
what
did
he
do
no
deal
he
never
did
deal
he
did
one
deal
house
and
if
you
did
that
house
you
be
in
jail
right
now
okay
he
got
away
with
murder
but
can
tell
you
the
thousands
of
them
they
were
lost
they
were
lost
if
you
were
in
my
world
you
would
know
that
be
lost
they
be
lost
so
why
are
our
politicians
finding
out
where
those
are
they
talk
about
executive
orders
and
they
talk
about
immigration
and
they
talk
about
oh
well
we
have
to
stop
the
border
that
the
end
of
it
believe
me
if
did
something
you
would
have
border
that
would
be
great
but
they
talk
about
it
and
then
you
have
president
that
does
an
executive
order
nobody
even
heard
of
an
executive
order
he
does
it
to
let
people
come
in
and
nobody
does
anything
about
executive
orders
why
did
they
go
to
court
and
ask
for
declaratory
judgment
which
is
something
that
when
you
know
somebody
is
going
to
go
after
you
and
when
it
in
writing
and
he
been
saying
it
for
long
time
he
said
going
to
approve
this
and
that
why
did
our
republicans
go
in
and
get
declaratory
judgment
from
the
courts
because
you
could
have
started
the
process
six
months
earlier
instead
they
have
weak
lawsuit
that
probably
the
time
it
finished
know
so
much
about
this
six
seven
eight
years
from
now
everyone
going
to
forget
about
it
we
be
into
different
mode
and
our
country
will
be
further
destroyed
so
we
have
to
do
something
jobs
china
mean
made
so
much
money
fighting
against
the
chinese
one
of
the
best
deals
ever
did
was
against
the
chinese
and
they
respect
me
for
it
and
know
them
and
they
say
we
believe
what
we
getting
away
with
we
believe
how
stupid
your
leaders
are
they
tell
me
that
now
they
do
know
going
to
go
and
make
about
it
but
why
not
but
they
tell
me
that
and
by
the
way
especially
for
the
folks
here
that
sell
so
much
goods
mean
the
goods
you
sell
are
incredible
do
know
if
you
been
watching
what
happening
with
the
devaluations
of
so
many
countries
the
euro
china
is
going
crazy
with
the
devaluation
never
thought
that
they
have
the
guts
to
do
what
they
doing
they
are
devaluing
down
to
nothing
and
what
it
going
to
do
is
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
sell
your
product
it
going
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
compete
and
they
getting
away
with
it
and
they
would
have
even
done
it
two
years
ago
but
now
they
feel
we
so
weak
and
we
have
so
many
different
problems
all
over
the
world
that
they
can
do
it
but
you
watch
this
devaluation
of
all
of
it
mean
the
euro
china
mexico
everybody
is
devaluing
and
when
you
hear
the
dollar
is
getting
stronger
it
sounds
good
you
know
it
one
of
those
things
sounds
good
be
very
careful
be
very
careful
because
we
just
going
to
lose
more
and
more
business
to
these
foreign
countries
that
really
know
what
they
are
doing
they
have
it
set
do
forget
another
thing
china
became
the
number
one
economic
power
year
ago
that
was
unthinkable
to
think
that
that
was
going
to
happen
it
was
absolutely
unthinkable
so
it
happened
and
it
very
very
sad
now
we
spent
trillion
in
iraq
we
got
nothing
they
do
even
respect
us
they
do
even
care
about
us
until
they
started
getting
their
ass
kicked
and
call
oh
please
come
back
and
help
us
we
want
you
out
then
all
of
the
sudden
new
group
forms
isis
by
the
way
you
know
how
they
formed
they
took
the
oil
and
for
those
of
you
that
know
and
love
trump
there
are
some
of
you
have
been
saying
for
four
years
keep
the
oil
so
now
isis
has
the
oil
and
the
stuff
that
isis
does
have
iran
is
going
to
take
so
we
get
nothing
we
have
trillion
and
we
have
thousands
of
lives
lost
thousands
and
we
have
what
do
we
have
mean
walk
down
the
streets
of
new
york
and
see
so
many
wounded
warriors
incredible
people
and
we
have
to
help
those
people
we
have
to
help
our
vets
we
have
to
help
our
military
we
have
to
build
our
military
but
and
we
have
to
do
it
fast
we
have
to
do
it
fast
we
have
incompetent
people
they
put
people
in
charge
that
have
no
clue
what
they
doing
it
needs
money
we
have
to
make
our
country
rich
again
so
we
do
that
so
we
can
save
social
security
not
cutter
probably
be
the
only
republican
that
does
not
want
to
cut
social
security
not
cutter
of
social
security
want
to
make
the
country
rich
so
that
social
security
can
be
afforded
and
and
get
rid
of
the
waste
get
rid
of
the
fraud
but
you
deserve
your
social
security
you
been
paying
your
security
and
like
like
congressman
like
lot
of
the
people
that
are
talking
about
you
know
cutting
social
security
and
by
the
way
the
democrats
are
eating
your
lunch
on
this
issue
it
an
issue
that
you
not
going
to
win
you
got
to
make
the
country
rich
again
and
strong
again
so
that
you
can
afford
it
and
so
you
can
afford
military
and
all
of
the
other
things
now
we
have
game
changer
now
and
the
game
changer
is
nuclear
weapons
we
really
do
have
to
get
strong
and
we
have
to
get
strong
fast
we
let
iran
get
nuclear
weapon
we
do
it
do
it
we
can
not
let
that
happen
you
know
in
the
old
days
would
have
said
years
ago
years
ago
years
ago
pull
out
and
let
them
fight
each
other
here
we
are
in
syria
we
fighting
people
that
want
to
overturn
syria
think
of
this
we
fighting
isis
but
isis
wants
to
overturn
the
government
maybe
you
let
them
fight
for
little
while
and
then
you
take
out
the
one
that
remains
okay
but
think
of
it
think
of
it
isis
is
fighting
them
and
we
are
bombing
the
hell
out
of
them
but
we
want
syria
to
fall
there
are
so
many
things
there
are
so
many
things
but
the
one
game
changer
that
we
have
to
be
careful
with
that
we
never
really
had
to
think
about
too
much
before
other
than
number
of
years
ago
is
the
nuclear
nuclear
today
it
not
like
soldiers
in
uniforms
shooting
rifles
you
can
take
out
the
east
coast
of
this
country
you
can
take
out
large
sections
of
the
you
can
take
out
things
that
were
unthinkable
the
power
and
we
have
to
be
in
position
where
that
never
ever
ever
every
happens
we
never
had
this
before
we
have
situation
in
we
spending
tremendous
amounts
of
money
there
we
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
we
have
leadership
again
no
leadership
respects
us
you
know
leadership
of
other
places
never
respect
stupid
people
okay
that
one
thing
you
going
to
find
the
same
thing
is
happening
there
and
never
knew
that
until
year
ago
or
so
has
tremendous
wealth
in
minerals
different
not
the
oil
but
minerals
and
we
fighting
here
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
china
is
taking
out
all
the
minerals
they
taking
it
out
trillion
of
dollars
and
millions
of
dollars
of
minerals
so
we
fighting
here
and
they
are
taking
it
out
looking
at
us
and
saying
thank
you
very
much
sucker
it
really
really
crazy
so
we
have
to
rebuild
quickly
our
infrastructure
of
this
country
if
we
do
the
other
day
in
ohio
bridge
collapsed
bridges
are
collapsing
all
over
the
country
the
reports
on
bridges
and
the
like
are
unbelievable
what
happening
with
our
infrastructure
go
to
saudi
arabia
go
to
am
doing
big
jobs
in
go
to
various
different
places
go
to
china
they
are
building
bridge
on
every
corner
they
have
bridges
that
make
the
george
washington
bridge
like
small
time
stuff
they
building
the
most
incredible
things
you
have
ever
seen
they
are
building
airports
in
qatar
which
they
like
to
say
cutter
but
always
said
qatar
so
keep
it
qatar
what
the
hell
but
they
building
they
building
an
airport
and
have
just
completed
an
airport
the
likes
of
which
you
have
never
seen
in
an
airport
the
likes
of
which
you
have
never
seen
and
then
come
back
to
where
the
runways
have
potholes
the
place
is
falling
apart
you
go
into
the
main
terminal
and
they
have
floor
that
so
old
it
falling
apart
and
they
have
hole
in
it
and
they
replace
it
with
asphalt
so
you
have
white
floor
and
they
put
asphalt
all
over
the
place
this
is
inside
not
outside
and
just
left
where
they
have
the
most
incredible
thing
you
ever
seen
in
fact
my
pilot
said
oh
trump
this
is
such
an
said
it
not
an
they
just
smart
but
you
look
at
lax
and
you
look
at
kennedy
airport
and
you
look
at
our
airports
generally
you
look
at
our
roadways
where
they
crumbling
you
look
at
all
of
the
things
that
are
bad
give
you
an
example
and
this
is
part
of
what
was
going
to
say
but
ride
down
the
highways
and
somebody
makes
those
guard
rails
you
know
the
guard
rails
the
ones
that
sort
of
go
like
this
demonstrates
with
hand
that
are
always
bent
rusted
and
horrible
did
you
ever
see
more
than
like
feet
which
is
corroded
or
bent
or
the
heat
if
it
gets
too
hot
it
just
crushes
now
they
been
selling
this
thing
for
years
why
does
someone
stop
them
and
get
something
that
works
because
they
do
know
they
do
know
what
happening
somebody
made
lot
of
money
on
that
they
do
know
what
is
happening
so
we
have
to
make
our
country
great
again
we
have
to
rebuild
our
country
and
we
have
long
way
to
go
we
are
just
in
such
serious
trouble
because
we
owe
so
much
money
now
we
owe
it
to
the
chinese
lot
of
it
we
owe
it
to
other
countries
they
the
ones
that
hold
the
debt
and
then
we
give
them
money
we
have
countries
that
we
owe
money
to
and
yet
we
giving
them
subsidies
just
ordered
thousands
of
television
sets
and
between
and
and
mean
you
know
no
american
company
comes
to
see
and
comes
to
bid
it
south
korea
and
whenever
they
have
problem
we
send
the
battleships
we
send
the
destroyers
we
send
our
we
going
to
protect
them
what
are
we
doing
why
are
they
paying
us
why
are
they
paying
us
what
are
we
doing
order
thousands
and
thousands
of
sets
all
the
time
for
some
reason
it
south
korea
you
know
whether
it
china
south
korea
but
in
this
case
televisions
south
korea
why
are
they
doing
something
to
justify
what
is
going
on
now
we
have
very
important
election
coming
up
we
have
presidential
election
coming
up
and
we
have
some
good
people
nobody
like
trump
of
course
but
these
are
minor
details
we
have
some
good
people
it
be
mitt
because
mitt
ran
and
failed
he
failed
mean
liked
him
look
like
him
dislike
him
the
statement
that
he
made
that
not
going
away
the
from
that
not
going
away
what
do
you
think
they
going
to
say
oh
we
bring
that
up
this
time
it
not
fair
because
it
was
long
that
does
work
but
more
importantly
he
choked
something
happened
to
him
in
the
last
month
he
had
that
election
won
and
let
me
tell
you
something
that
election
sort
of
like
that
close
the
deal
know
many
of
those
guys
they
get
it
up
to
the
line
they
go
ah
ah
close
it
or
golfer
that
sink
the
to
win
the
tournament
and
there
are
many
of
them
most
people
are
like
that
mean
most
people
are
like
that
you
give
somebody
another
chance
actually
think
this
election
is
tougher
to
win
than
beating
failed
president
really
do
think
beating
would
have
been
much
easier
one
than
the
one
that
coming
up
which
is
sad
to
say
but
true
so
you
have
he
choked
you
have
bush
the
last
thing
we
need
is
another
bush
now
made
that
statement
very
strongly
and
now
every
one
says
the
last
thing
you
know
they
copied
it
be
accused
of
copying
the
statement
that
the
bad
thing
but
said
it
was
the
one
that
said
it
first
and
mean
it
the
last
thing
we
need
is
another
bush
now
he
totally
in
of
common
core
that
disaster
that
bad
it
should
be
local
and
all
of
that
but
he
totally
in
of
common
core
he
very
very
weak
on
immigration
do
forget
remember
his
statement
they
come
for
love
say
what
come
for
love
you
got
these
people
coming
half
of
them
are
criminals
they
coming
for
love
they
coming
for
lot
of
other
reasons
and
it
not
love
and
when
he
runs
you
got
to
remember
his
brother
really
gave
us
was
never
big
fan
but
his
brother
gave
us
abraham
lincoln
coming
home
back
from
the
dead
could
not
have
won
the
election
because
it
was
going
so
badly
and
the
economy
was
just
absolutely
in
shambles
that
last
couple
of
months
and
then
he
appointed
justice
and
wanted
justice
and
justice
basically
approved
in
shocking
decision
that
nobody
believes
so
you
have
bush
and
he
going
to
lose
aside
from
that
he
not
going
to
win
so
mitt
and
you
just
have
those
two
that
it
that
it
it
so
simple
so
just
in
summing
up
and
just
wrote
few
of
these
little
points
down
because
it
very
important
and
watch
these
and
by
the
way
think
any
president
candidate
that
runs
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
because
we
got
one
that
uses
and
people
say
oh
he
is
so
quick
on
his
feet
he
is
reading
it
mean
give
me
break
everything
is
read
you
do
really
test
the
mettle
of
man
or
woman
unless
they
can
get
up
on
stage
and
talk
and
that
what
we
ended
up
getting
the
king
of
but
so
when
look
at
these
things
here
say
you
know
what
it
so
much
easier
it
would
be
so
nice
just
bah
pa
bah
pa
bah
bing
bing
bing
no
problems
get
off
stage
everybody
falls
asleep
and
that
the
end
of
that
but
we
have
to
do
something
about
these
but
in
looking
at
these
situations
built
an
incredible
company
and
you
see
that
an
incredible
company
wonderful
company
employ
thousands
of
people
and
love
doing
what
doing
and
in
certain
way
wish
were
doing
this
but
our
country
is
in
such
trouble
and
would
be
so
easy
to
fix
we
have
such
great
potential
so
if
run
for
president
and
if
win
would
totally
succeed
in
creating
jobs
defeating
isis
and
stopping
the
islamic
terrorists
and
you
have
to
do
that
reducing
the
budget
deficit
so
important
have
to
do
it
securing
our
southern
border
and
mean
seriously
securing
it
stopping
nuclear
weapons
in
iran
and
elsewhere
saving
social
security
and
without
cutting
it
down
to
the
bone
because
it
not
fair
to
people
that
have
been
paying
for
their
whole
lives
and
other
people
and
it
not
fair
to
future
people
coming
up
and
we
can
do
it
repealing
and
replacing
it
with
something
far
better
for
the
people
and
far
less
expensive
both
for
the
people
and
for
the
country
and
believe
me
there
are
plans
that
are
so
much
better
for
everybody
and
everybody
can
be
covered
not
saying
leave
of
the
people
out
everybody
can
be
this
plan
is
just
basic
disaster
nobody
knows
as
bad
as
the
website
was
this
is
how
bad
the
plan
itself
is
fixing
our
country
infrastructure
our
bridges
our
schools
our
highways
our
airports
and
that
can
tell
you
nobody
is
close
to
trump
just
got
the
best
hotel
in
north
america
building
which
is
sort
of
interesting
think
of
this
one
building
one
of
the
great
hotels
of
the
world
on
avenue
right
opposite
the
white
house
between
the
white
house
and
congress
right
on
the
old
post
office
site
and
got
it
from
do
you
believe
that
and
everybody
wanted
it
so
believe
it
myself
but
it
going
to
be
fantastic
and
so
many
other
things
know
what
needs
to
be
done
to
make
america
great
again
we
can
make
this
country
great
again
the
potential
is
enormous
and
am
serious
thinking
of
running
for
president
because
can
do
the
job
thank
you
all
very
much
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
beautiful
thank
you
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
you
and
thank
you
to
the
for
national
interest
for
me
with
this
invitation
it
truly
is
great
like
to
talk
today
about
how
to
develop
new
foreign
policy
direction
for
our
country
one
that
replaces
randomness
with
purpose
ideology
with
strategy
and
chaos
with
peace
time
to
shake
the
rust
off
foreign
policy
time
to
invite
new
voices
and
new
visions
into
the
fold
something
we
have
to
do
the
direction
will
outline
today
will
also
return
us
to
timeless
principle
my
foreign
policy
will
always
put
the
interests
of
the
american
people
and
american
security
above
all
else
it
has
to
be
first
has
to
be
that
will
be
the
foundation
of
every
single
decision
that
will
make
america
first
will
be
the
major
and
overriding
theme
of
my
administration
but
to
chart
our
path
forward
we
must
first
briefly
take
look
back
we
have
lot
to
be
proud
of
in
the
we
saved
the
world
the
greatest
generation
beat
back
the
nazis
and
imperialists
then
we
saved
the
world
again
this
time
from
totalitarianism
and
communism
the
cold
war
lasted
for
decades
but
guess
what
we
won
and
we
won
big
democrats
and
republicans
working
together
got
to
heed
the
words
of
president
our
great
president
when
he
said
tear
down
this
wall
history
will
not
forget
what
he
did
very
special
man
and
president
unfortunately
after
the
cold
war
our
foreign
policy
veered
badly
off
course
we
failed
to
develop
new
vision
for
new
time
in
fact
as
time
went
on
our
foreign
policy
began
to
make
less
and
less
sense
logic
was
replaced
with
foolishness
and
arrogance
which
led
to
one
foreign
policy
disaster
after
another
they
just
kept
coming
and
coming
we
went
from
mistakes
in
iraq
to
egypt
to
libya
to
president
line
in
the
sand
in
syria
each
of
these
actions
have
helped
to
throw
the
region
into
chaos
and
gave
isis
the
space
it
needs
to
grow
and
prosper
very
bad
it
all
began
with
dangerous
idea
that
we
could
make
western
democracies
out
of
countries
that
had
no
experience
or
interests
in
becoming
western
democracy
we
tore
up
what
institutions
they
had
and
then
were
surprised
at
what
we
unleashed
civil
war
religious
fanaticism
thousands
of
americans
and
just
killed
be
lives
lives
lives
wasted
horribly
wasted
many
trillions
of
dollars
were
lost
as
result
the
vacuum
was
created
that
isis
would
fill
iran
too
would
rush
in
and
fill
that
void
much
to
their
really
unjust
enrichment
they
have
benefited
so
much
so
sadly
for
us
our
foreign
policy
is
complete
and
total
disaster
no
vision
no
purpose
no
direction
no
strategy
today
want
to
identify
five
main
weaknesses
in
our
foreign
policy
first
our
resources
are
totally
over
extended
president
has
weakened
our
military
by
weakening
our
economy
crippled
us
with
wasteful
spending
massive
debt
low
growth
huge
trade
deficit
and
open
borders
our
manufacturing
trade
deficit
with
the
world
is
now
approaching
trillion
year
rebuilding
other
countries
while
weakening
our
own
ending
the
theft
of
american
jobs
will
give
us
resources
we
need
to
rebuild
our
military
which
has
to
happen
and
regain
our
financial
independence
and
strength
am
the
only
person
running
for
the
presidency
who
understands
this
and
this
is
serious
problem
the
only
one
believe
me
know
them
all
the
only
one
who
knows
how
to
fix
it
secondly
our
allies
are
not
paying
their
fair
share
and
been
talking
about
this
recently
lot
our
allies
must
contribute
toward
their
financial
political
and
human
costs
have
to
do
it
of
our
tremendous
security
burden
but
many
of
them
are
simply
not
doing
so
they
look
at
the
united
states
as
weak
and
forgiving
and
feel
no
obligation
to
their
agreements
with
us
in
nato
for
instance
only
of
other
member
countries
besides
america
are
spending
the
minimum
required
percent
of
on
we
have
spent
trillions
of
dollars
over
time
on
planes
missiles
ships
equipment
building
up
our
military
to
provide
strong
for
europe
and
asia
the
countries
we
are
defending
must
pay
for
the
cost
of
this
and
if
not
the
must
be
prepared
to
let
these
countries
defend
themselves
we
have
no
choice
the
whole
world
will
be
safer
if
our
allies
do
their
part
to
support
our
common
and
security
trump
administration
will
lead
free
world
that
is
properly
armed
and
funded
and
funded
beautifully
thirdly
our
friends
are
beginning
to
think
they
depend
on
us
had
president
who
dislikes
our
friends
and
bows
to
our
enemies
something
that
never
seen
before
in
the
history
of
our
country
he
negotiated
disastrous
deal
with
iran
and
then
we
watched
them
ignore
its
terms
even
before
the
ink
was
dry
iran
can
not
be
allowed
to
have
nuclear
weapon
can
not
be
allowed
remember
that
can
not
be
allowed
to
have
nuclear
weapon
and
under
trump
administration
will
never
ever
be
allowed
to
have
that
nuclear
weapon
all
of
this
without
even
mentioning
the
humiliation
of
the
united
states
with
treatment
of
our
ten
captured
sailors
so
vividly
remember
that
day
in
negotiation
you
must
be
willing
to
walk
the
iran
deal
like
so
many
of
our
worst
agreements
is
the
result
of
not
being
willing
to
leave
the
table
when
the
other
side
knows
not
going
to
walk
it
becomes
absolutely
impossible
to
win
you
just
win
at
the
same
time
your
friends
need
to
know
that
you
will
stick
by
the
agreements
that
you
have
with
them
made
that
agreement
you
have
to
stand
by
it
and
the
world
will
be
better
place
president
gutted
our
missile
program
and
then
abandoned
our
missile
plans
with
poland
and
the
czech
republic
he
supported
the
ouster
of
friendly
regime
in
egypt
that
had
longstanding
peace
treaty
with
israel
and
then
helped
bring
the
muslim
brotherhood
to
power
in
its
place
israel
our
great
friend
and
the
one
true
democracy
in
the
middle
east
has
been
snubbed
and
by
an
administration
that
lacks
moral
clarity
just
few
days
ago
vice
president
again
israel
force
for
justice
and
peace
for
acting
as
an
impatient
peace
area
in
the
region
president
has
not
been
friend
to
israel
he
has
treated
iran
with
tender
love
and
care
and
made
it
great
power
iran
has
indeed
become
great
great
power
in
just
very
short
period
of
time
because
of
what
done
all
of
the
expense
and
all
at
the
expense
of
israel
our
allies
in
the
region
and
very
importantly
the
united
states
itself
picked
fights
with
our
oldest
friends
and
now
starting
to
look
elsewhere
for
help
remember
that
not
good
fourth
our
rivals
no
longer
respect
us
in
fact
just
as
confused
as
our
allies
but
in
an
even
bigger
problem
is
they
take
us
seriously
anymore
the
truth
is
they
respect
us
when
president
landed
in
cuba
on
air
force
one
no
leader
was
there
nobody
to
greet
him
perhaps
an
incident
without
precedent
in
the
long
and
prestigious
history
of
air
force
one
then
amazingly
the
same
thing
happened
in
saudi
arabia
called
no
respect
absolutely
no
respect
do
you
remember
when
the
president
made
long
and
expensive
trip
to
denmark
to
get
the
olympics
for
our
country
and
after
this
unprecedented
effort
it
was
announced
that
the
united
states
came
in
fourth
fourth
place
the
president
of
the
united
states
making
this
trip
unprecedented
comes
in
fourth
place
he
should
have
known
the
result
before
making
such
an
embarrassing
commitment
we
were
laughed
at
all
over
the
world
as
we
have
been
many
many
times
the
list
of
humiliations
go
on
and
on
and
on
president
watches
helplessly
as
north
korea
increases
its
aggression
and
expands
further
and
further
with
its
nuclear
reach
our
president
has
allowed
china
to
continue
its
economic
assault
on
american
jobs
and
wealth
refusing
to
enforce
trade
deals
and
apply
leverage
on
china
necessary
to
rein
in
north
korea
we
have
the
leverage
we
have
the
power
over
china
economic
power
and
people
understand
it
and
with
that
economic
power
we
can
rein
in
and
we
can
get
them
to
do
what
they
have
to
do
with
north
korea
which
is
totally
out
of
control
he
has
even
allowed
china
to
steal
government
secrets
with
attacks
and
engaged
in
industrial
espionage
against
the
united
states
and
its
companies
let
our
rivals
and
challengers
think
they
can
get
away
with
anything
and
they
do
they
do
at
will
it
always
happens
if
president
goal
had
been
to
weaken
america
he
could
not
have
done
better
job
finally
america
no
longer
has
clear
understanding
of
our
foreign
policy
goals
since
the
end
of
the
cold
war
and
the
breakup
of
the
soviet
union
lacked
coherent
foreign
policy
one
day
bombing
libya
and
getting
rid
of
dictator
to
foster
democracy
for
civilians
the
next
day
watching
the
same
civilians
suffer
while
that
country
falls
and
absolutely
falls
apart
lives
lost
massive
moneys
lost
the
world
is
different
place
humanitarian
nation
but
the
legacy
of
the
interventions
will
be
weakness
confusion
and
disarray
mess
made
the
middle
east
more
unstable
and
chaotic
than
ever
before
we
left
subject
to
intense
persecution
and
even
genocide
we
have
done
nothing
to
help
the
nothing
and
we
should
always
be
ashamed
for
that
for
that
lack
of
action
our
actions
in
iraq
libya
and
syria
have
helped
unleash
isis
and
in
war
against
radical
islam
but
president
even
name
the
enemy
and
unless
you
name
the
enemy
you
will
never
ever
solve
the
problem
also
refuses
to
say
the
words
radical
islam
even
as
she
pushes
for
massive
increase
in
refugees
coming
into
our
country
after
secretary
failed
intervention
in
libya
islamic
terrorists
in
took
down
our
consulate
and
killed
our
ambassador
and
three
brave
americans
then
instead
of
taking
charge
that
night
decided
to
go
home
and
sleep
incredible
blames
it
all
on
video
an
excuse
that
was
total
lie
proven
to
be
absolutely
total
lie
our
ambassador
was
murdered
and
our
secretary
of
state
misled
the
nation
and
by
the
way
she
was
not
awake
to
take
that
call
at
in
the
morning
and
now
isis
is
making
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
week
selling
libya
oil
and
you
know
what
we
blockade
we
bomb
we
do
anything
about
it
almost
as
if
our
country
even
know
happening
which
could
be
fact
and
could
be
true
this
will
all
change
when
become
president
to
our
friends
and
allies
say
america
is
going
to
be
strong
again
america
is
going
to
be
reliable
again
going
to
be
great
and
reliable
ally
again
going
to
be
friend
again
going
to
finally
have
coherent
foreign
policy
based
upon
american
interests
and
the
shared
interests
of
our
allies
getting
out
of
the
business
and
instead
focusing
on
creating
stability
in
the
world
our
moments
of
greatest
strength
came
when
politics
ended
at
the
edge
we
need
new
rational
american
foreign
policy
informed
by
the
best
minds
and
supported
by
both
parties
and
it
will
be
by
both
parties
democrats
republicans
independents
everybody
as
well
as
by
our
close
allies
this
is
how
we
won
the
cold
war
and
how
we
will
win
our
new
future
struggles
which
may
be
many
which
may
be
complex
but
we
will
win
if
become
president
first
we
need
plan
to
halt
the
spread
and
reach
of
radical
islam
containing
the
spread
of
radical
islam
must
be
major
foreign
policy
goal
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
the
world
events
may
require
the
use
of
military
force
but
also
philosophical
struggle
like
our
long
struggle
in
the
cold
war
in
this
going
to
be
working
very
closely
with
our
allies
in
the
muslim
world
all
of
which
are
at
risk
from
radical
islamic
violence
attacks
and
everything
else
it
is
dangerous
world
more
dangerous
now
than
it
has
ever
been
we
should
work
thank
you
we
should
work
together
with
any
nation
in
the
region
that
is
threatened
by
the
rise
of
radical
islam
but
this
has
to
be
street
they
must
also
be
good
to
us
remember
that
they
have
to
be
good
to
us
no
longer
one
way
now
and
remember
us
and
all
doing
they
have
to
appreciate
what
done
to
them
going
to
help
but
they
have
to
appreciate
what
done
for
them
the
struggle
against
radical
islam
also
takes
place
in
our
homeland
there
are
scores
of
recent
migrants
inside
our
borders
charged
with
terrorism
for
every
case
known
to
the
public
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
more
we
must
stop
importing
extremism
through
senseless
immigration
policies
we
have
no
idea
where
these
people
are
coming
from
no
documentation
no
paperwork
nothing
we
have
to
be
smart
we
have
to
be
vigilant
pause
for
reassessment
will
help
us
to
prevent
the
next
san
or
frankly
much
worse
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
world
trade
and
september
one
of
the
great
catastrophes
in
my
opinion
the
single
greatest
military
catastrophe
in
the
history
of
our
country
worse
than
pearl
because
you
take
look
at
happened
and
citizens
were
attacked
as
opposed
to
the
military
being
attacked
one
of
the
true
great
catastrophes
and
then
isis
have
simple
message
for
them
their
days
are
numbered
tell
them
where
and
tell
them
how
we
must
we
must
as
nation
be
more
unpredictable
we
are
totally
predictable
we
tell
everything
sending
troops
we
tell
them
sending
something
else
we
have
news
conference
we
have
to
be
unpredictable
and
we
have
to
be
unpredictable
starting
now
but
going
to
be
gone
isis
will
be
gone
if
elected
president
and
be
gone
quickly
they
will
be
gone
very
very
quickly
secondly
we
have
to
rebuild
our
military
and
our
economy
the
and
chinese
have
rapidly
expanded
their
military
capability
but
look
at
happened
to
us
our
nuclear
weapons
arsenal
our
ultimate
deterrent
has
been
allowed
to
atrophy
and
is
desperately
in
need
of
and
renewal
and
it
has
to
happen
immediately
our
active
duty
armed
forces
have
shrunk
from
million
in
to
about
million
today
the
navy
has
shrunk
from
over
ships
to
ships
during
this
same
period
of
time
the
air
force
is
about
smaller
than
pilots
flying
in
combat
missions
today
these
planes
are
older
than
virtually
everybody
in
this
room
and
what
are
we
doing
about
this
president
has
proposed
budget
that
in
real
dollars
cuts
nearly
percent
from
what
we
were
spending
in
our
military
is
depleted
and
asking
our
generals
and
military
leaders
to
worry
about
global
warming
we
will
spend
what
we
need
to
rebuild
our
military
it
is
the
cheapest
single
investment
we
can
make
we
will
develop
build
and
purchase
the
best
equipment
known
to
mankind
our
military
dominance
must
be
unquestioned
and
mean
unquestioned
by
anybody
and
everybody
but
we
will
look
for
savings
and
spend
our
money
wisely
in
this
time
of
mounting
debt
right
now
we
have
so
much
debt
that
nobody
even
knows
how
to
address
the
problem
but
do
no
one
dollar
can
be
wasted
not
one
single
dollar
can
we
waste
also
going
to
have
to
change
our
trade
immigration
and
economic
policies
to
make
our
economy
strong
again
and
to
put
americans
first
again
this
will
ensure
that
our
own
workers
right
here
in
america
get
the
jobs
and
higher
pay
that
will
grow
our
tax
revenues
increase
our
economic
might
as
nation
make
us
strong
financially
again
so
so
important
we
need
to
think
smart
about
areas
where
our
technological
superiority
and
nobody
comes
close
gives
us
an
edge
this
includes
printing
artificial
intelligence
and
warfare
great
country
also
takes
care
of
its
warriors
our
commitment
to
them
is
absolute
and
mean
absolute
trump
administration
will
give
our
servicemen
and
women
the
best
equipment
and
support
in
the
world
when
they
serve
and
where
they
serve
and
the
best
care
in
the
world
when
they
return
as
veterans
and
they
come
back
home
to
civilian
life
our
veterans
our
veterans
have
not
been
treated
fairly
or
justly
these
are
our
great
people
and
we
must
treat
them
fairly
we
must
even
treat
them
really
really
well
and
that
will
happen
under
the
trump
administration
finally
we
must
develop
foreign
policy
based
on
american
interests
businesses
do
not
succeed
when
they
lose
sight
of
their
core
interests
and
neither
do
countries
look
at
what
happened
in
the
our
embassies
in
kenya
and
tanzania
and
this
was
horrible
time
for
us
were
attacked
and
brave
sailors
were
killed
on
the
cole
and
what
did
we
do
it
seemed
we
put
more
effort
into
adding
china
into
the
world
trade
which
has
been
total
disaster
for
the
united
states
frankly
we
spent
more
time
on
that
than
we
did
in
stopping
we
even
had
an
opportunity
to
take
out
bin
laden
and
we
do
it
and
then
we
got
hit
at
the
world
trade
and
the
pentagon
again
the
worst
attack
on
our
country
in
its
history
our
foreign
policy
goals
must
be
based
on
core
national
security
interests
and
the
following
will
be
my
priorities
in
the
middle
east
our
goals
must
be
and
mean
must
be
to
defeat
terrorists
and
promote
regional
stability
not
radical
change
we
need
to
be
clearsighted
about
the
groups
that
will
never
be
anything
other
than
enemies
and
believe
me
we
have
groups
that
no
matter
what
you
do
they
will
be
the
enemy
we
have
to
be
smart
enough
to
who
those
groups
are
who
those
people
are
and
not
help
them
and
we
must
only
be
generous
to
those
that
prove
they
are
indeed
our
friends
we
desire
to
live
peacefully
and
in
friendship
with
russia
and
china
we
have
serious
differences
with
these
two
nations
and
must
regard
them
with
open
eyes
but
we
are
not
bound
to
be
adversaries
we
should
seek
common
ground
based
on
shared
interests
russia
for
instance
has
also
seen
the
horror
of
islamic
terrorism
believe
an
easing
of
tensions
and
improved
relations
with
russia
from
position
of
strength
only
is
possible
absolutely
possible
common
sense
says
this
cycle
this
horrible
cycle
of
hostility
must
end
and
ideally
will
end
soon
good
for
both
countries
some
say
the
be
reasonable
intend
to
find
out
if
we
make
deal
under
my
administration
deal
great
not
good
great
for
america
but
also
good
for
russia
then
we
will
quickly
walk
from
the
table
as
simple
as
that
going
to
find
out
fixing
our
relations
with
china
is
another
important
step
and
really
toward
creating
an
even
more
prosperous
period
of
time
china
respects
strength
and
by
letting
them
take
advantage
of
us
economically
which
they
are
doing
like
never
before
we
have
lost
all
of
their
respect
we
have
massive
trade
deficit
with
china
deficit
that
we
have
to
find
way
quickly
and
mean
quickly
to
balance
strong
and
smart
america
is
an
america
that
will
find
better
friend
in
china
better
than
we
have
right
now
look
at
what
china
is
doing
in
the
south
china
sea
not
supposed
to
be
doing
it
no
respect
for
this
country
or
this
president
we
can
both
benefit
or
we
can
both
go
our
separate
ways
if
need
be
going
to
have
to
happen
after
elected
president
will
also
call
for
summit
with
our
nato
allies
and
separate
summit
with
our
asian
allies
in
these
summits
we
will
not
only
discuss
of
financial
commitments
but
take
fresh
look
at
how
we
can
adopt
new
strategies
for
tackling
our
common
challenges
for
instance
we
will
discuss
how
we
can
upgrade
outdated
mission
and
structure
grown
out
of
the
cold
war
to
confront
our
shared
challenges
including
migration
and
islamic
terrorism
will
not
hesitate
to
deploy
military
force
when
there
is
no
alternative
but
if
america
fights
it
must
only
fight
to
win
will
never
sent
our
finest
into
battle
unless
necessary
and
mean
absolutely
necessary
and
will
only
do
so
if
we
have
plan
for
victory
with
capital
our
goal
is
peace
and
prosperity
not
war
and
destruction
the
best
way
to
achieve
those
goals
is
through
disciplined
deliberate
and
consistent
foreign
policy
with
president
and
secretary
had
the
exact
opposite
reckless
rudderless
and
aimless
foreign
policy
one
that
has
blazed
the
path
of
destruction
in
its
wake
after
losing
thousands
of
lives
and
spending
trillions
of
dollars
we
are
in
far
worst
shape
in
the
middle
east
than
ever
ever
before
challenge
anyone
to
explain
the
strategic
foreign
policy
vision
of
it
has
been
complete
and
total
disaster
will
also
be
prepared
to
deploy
economic
resources
financial
leverage
and
sanctions
can
be
very
very
persuasive
but
we
need
to
use
them
selectively
and
with
total
determination
our
power
will
be
used
if
others
do
not
play
by
the
rules
in
other
words
if
they
do
not
treat
us
fairly
our
friends
and
enemies
must
know
that
if
draw
line
in
the
sand
will
enforce
that
line
in
the
sand
believe
me
however
unlike
other
candidates
for
the
presidency
war
and
aggression
will
not
be
my
first
instinct
you
can
not
have
foreign
policy
without
diplomacy
superpower
understands
that
caution
and
restraint
are
really
truly
signs
of
strength
although
not
in
government
service
was
totally
against
the
war
in
iraq
very
proudly
saying
for
many
years
that
it
would
the
middle
east
sadly
was
correct
and
the
biggest
beneficiary
has
been
has
been
iran
who
is
systematically
taking
over
iraq
and
gaining
access
to
their
very
rich
oil
reserves
something
it
has
wanted
to
do
for
decades
and
now
to
top
it
off
we
have
isis
my
goal
is
to
establish
foreign
policy
that
will
endure
for
several
generations
why
also
look
and
have
to
look
for
talented
experts
with
approaches
and
practical
ideas
rather
than
surrounding
myself
with
those
who
have
perfect
but
very
little
to
brag
about
except
responsibility
for
long
history
of
failed
policies
and
continued
losses
at
war
we
have
to
look
to
new
people
we
have
to
look
to
new
people
because
many
of
the
old
people
frankly
know
what
doing
even
though
they
may
look
awfully
good
writing
in
the
new
york
times
or
being
watched
on
television
finally
will
work
with
our
allies
to
reinvigorate
western
values
and
institutions
instead
of
trying
to
spread
universal
values
that
not
everybody
shares
or
wants
we
should
understand
that
strengthening
and
promoting
western
and
its
accomplishments
will
do
more
to
inspire
positive
reforms
around
the
world
than
military
interventions
these
are
my
goals
as
president
will
seek
foreign
policy
that
all
americans
whatever
their
party
can
support
so
important
and
which
our
friends
and
allies
will
respect
and
totally
welcome
the
world
must
know
that
we
do
not
go
abroad
in
search
of
enemies
that
we
are
always
happy
when
old
enemies
become
friends
and
when
old
friends
become
allies
what
we
want
we
want
them
to
be
our
allies
we
want
the
world
to
be
we
want
to
bring
peace
to
the
world
too
much
destruction
out
there
too
many
destructive
weapons
the
power
of
weaponry
is
the
single
biggest
problem
that
we
have
today
in
the
world
to
achieve
these
goals
americans
must
have
confidence
in
their
country
and
its
leadership
again
many
americans
must
wonder
why
we
our
politicians
seem
more
interested
in
defending
the
borders
of
foreign
countries
than
in
defending
their
own
americans
americans
must
know
that
putting
the
american
people
first
again
on
trade
so
true
on
trade
on
immigration
on
foreign
policy
the
jobs
incomes
and
security
of
the
american
worker
will
always
be
my
first
priority
no
country
has
ever
prospered
that
failed
to
put
its
own
interests
first
both
our
friends
and
our
enemies
put
their
countries
above
ours
and
we
while
being
fair
to
them
must
start
doing
the
same
we
will
no
longer
surrender
this
country
or
its
people
to
the
false
song
of
the
remains
the
true
foundation
for
happiness
and
harmony
am
of
international
unions
that
tie
us
up
and
bring
america
down
and
will
never
enter
and
under
my
administration
we
will
never
enter
america
into
any
agreement
that
reduces
our
ability
to
control
our
own
affairs
as
an
example
has
been
total
disaster
for
the
united
states
and
has
emptied
our
states
literally
emptied
our
states
of
our
manufacturing
and
our
jobs
and
just
gotten
to
see
it
toured
toured
new
york
toured
so
many
of
the
states
they
have
been
cleaned
out
their
manufacturing
is
gone
never
again
only
the
reverse
and
have
to
say
this
strongly
never
again
only
the
reverse
will
happen
we
will
keep
our
jobs
and
bring
in
new
ones
there
will
be
consequences
for
the
companies
that
leave
the
united
states
only
to
exploit
it
later
they
fire
the
people
they
take
advantage
of
the
united
states
there
will
be
consequences
for
those
companies
never
again
under
trump
administration
no
american
citizen
will
ever
again
feel
that
their
needs
come
second
to
the
citizens
of
foreign
country
will
view
as
president
the
world
through
the
clear
lens
of
american
interests
will
be
greatest
defender
and
most
loyal
champion
we
will
not
for
becoming
successful
again
but
will
instead
embrace
the
unique
heritage
that
makes
us
who
we
are
the
world
is
most
peaceful
and
most
prosperous
when
america
is
strongest
america
will
continue
and
continue
forever
to
play
the
role
of
peacemaker
we
will
always
help
save
lives
and
indeed
humanity
itself
but
to
play
the
role
we
must
make
america
strong
again
and
always
always
always
we
must
make
and
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
every
angle
and
we
have
no
choice
we
must
make
america
respected
again
we
must
make
america
truly
wealthy
again
and
we
must
we
have
to
and
we
will
make
america
great
again
and
if
we
do
that
and
if
we
do
that
perhaps
this
century
can
be
the
most
peaceful
and
prosperous
the
world
has
ever
ever
known
thank
you
very
much
everybody
appreciate
it
thank
you
hand
with
little
fingers
coming
out
of
stem
like
little
look
at
my
hands
fine
nobody
other
than
carter
years
ago
used
to
use
that
my
hands
are
normal
hands
during
debate
he
was
losing
and
he
said
oh
he
has
small
hands
and
therefore
you
know
what
that
means
this
was
not
me
this
was
that
said
he
has
small
hands
and
you
know
what
that
means
okay
so
he
started
it
so
what
said
couple
of
days
later
and
what
happened
is
was
on
line
shaking
hands
with
supporters
and
one
of
supporters
got
up
and
he
said
trump
you
have
strong
hands
you
have
hands
and
then
another
one
would
say
you
have
great
hands
trump
had
no
idea
said
what
do
you
mean
he
said
thought
you
were
like
deformed
and
thought
you
had
small
hands
had
fifty
people
is
that
correct
statement
mean
people
were
writing
how
are
hands
my
hands
are
fine
you
know
my
hands
are
normal
slightly
large
actually
in
fact
buy
slightly
smaller
than
large
glove
okay
no
but
did
this
because
everybody
was
saying
to
me
oh
your
hands
are
very
nice
they
are
normal
so
in
debate
said
because
he
had
nothing
else
to
say
now
was
hitting
him
pretty
hard
he
wanted
to
do
his
don
stuff
and
it
work
out
obviously
it
work
too
well
but
one
of
the
things

than
mexico
coming
from
all
over
south
and
latin
america
and
coming
probably
probably
from
the
middle
east
but
we
know
because
we
have
no
protection
and
we
have
no
competence
we
know
happening
and
got
to
stop
and
got
to
stop
fast
islamic
terrorism
is
eating
up
large
portions
of
the
middle
east
become
rich
in
competition
with
them
they
just
built
hotel
in
syria
can
you
believe
this
they
built
hotel
when
have
to
build
hotel
pay
interest
they
have
to
pay
interest
because
they
took
the
oil
that
when
we
left
iraq
said
we
taken
so
now
isis
has
the
oil
and
what
they
have
iran
has
and
in
and
will
tell
you
this
and
said
it
very
strongly
years
ago
said
and
love
the
military
and
want
to
have
the
strongest
military
that
ever
had
and
we
need
it
more
now
than
ever
but
said
hit
iraq
because
going
to
totally
the
middle
east
iran
is
going
to
take
over
the
middle
east
iran
and
somebody
else
will
get
the
oil
and
it
turned
out
that
iran
is
now
taking
over
iraq
think
of
it
iran
is
taking
over
iraq
and
taking
it
over
big
league
we
spent
trillion
in
iraq
trillion
we
lost
thousands
of
lives
thousands
in
iraq
we
have
wounded
soldiers
who
love
love
great
all
over
the
place
thousands
and
thousands
of
wounded
soldiers
and
we
have
nothing
we
even
go
there
we
have
nothing
and
every
time
we
give
iraq
equipment
the
first
time
bullet
goes
off
in
the
air
they
leave
it
last
week
read
these
are
big
vehicles
were
left
behind
for
the
enemy
you
would
say
maybe
two
maybe
four
sophisticated
vehicles
they
ran
and
the
enemy
took
them
last
quarter
it
was
just
announced
our
gross
domestic
product
sign
of
strength
right
but
not
for
us
it
was
below
zero
whoever
heard
of
this
never
below
zero
our
participation
rate
was
the
worst
since
but
think
of
it
below
zero
horrible
participation
rate
and
our
real
unemployment
is
anywhere
from
to
percent
believe
the
believe
it
right
lot
of
people
up
there
get
jobs
they
get
jobs
because
there
are
no
jobs
because
china
has
our
jobs
and
mexico
has
our
jobs
they
all
have
jobs
but
the
real
number
the
real
number
is
anywhere
from
to
and
maybe
even
percent
and
nobody
talks
about
it
because
statistic
full
of
nonsense
our
enemies
are
getting
stronger
and
stronger
by
the
way
and
we
as
country
are
getting
weaker
even
our
nuclear
arsenal
work
it
came
out
recently
they
have
equipment
that
is
years
old
they
know
if
it
worked
and
thought
it
was
horrible
when
it
was
broadcast
on
television
because
boy
does
that
send
signals
to
and
all
of
the
other
people
that
look
at
us
and
they
say
that
is
group
of
people
and
that
is
nation
that
truly
has
no
clue
they
know
what
doing
they
know
what
doing
we
have
disaster
called
the
big
lie
yesterday
it
came
out
that
costs
are
going
for
people
up
and
even
percent
and
are
through
the
roof
you
have
to
be
hit
by
tractor
literally
tractor
to
use
it
because
the
are
so
high
virtually
useless
virtually
useless
it
is
and
remember
the
billion
web
site
billion
we
spent
on
web
site
and
to
this
day
it
work
billion
web
site
if
and
when
the
vatican
is
attacked
by
isis
which
as
everyone
knows
is
ultimate
trophy
can
promise
you
that
the
pope
would
have
only
wished
and
prayed
that
trump
would
have
been
president
because
this
would
not
have
happened
isis
would
have
been
eradicated
unlike
what
is
happening
now
with
our
all
talk
no
action
politicians
the
mexican
government
and
its
leadership
has
made
many
disparaging
remarks
about
me
to
the
pope
because
they
want
to
continue
to
rip
off
the
united
states
both
on
trade
and
at
the
border
and
they
understand
am
totally
wise
to
them
the
pope
only
heard
one
side
of
the
story
he
see
the
crime
the
drug
trafficking
and
the
negative
economic
impact
the
current
policies
have
on
the
united
states
he
see
how
mexican
leadership
is
president
and
our
leadership
in
every
aspect
of
negotiation
for
religious
leader
to
question
faith
is
disgraceful
am
proud
to
be
christian
and
as
president
will
not
allow
to
be
consistently
attacked
and
weakened
unlike
what
is
happening
now
with
our
current
president
no
leader
especially
religious
leader
should
have
the
right
to
question
another
religion
or
faith
they
are
using
the
pope
as
pawn
and
they
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
doing
so
especially
when
so
many
lives
are
involved
and
when
illegal
immigration
is
so
rampant
have
so
many
web
sites
have
them
all
over
the
place
hire
people
they
do
web
site
it
costs
me
billion
web
site
well
you
need
somebody
because
politicians
are
all
talk
no
action
get
done
they
will
not
bring
us
believe
me
to
the
promised
land
they
will
not
as
an
example
been
on
the
circuit
making
speeches
and
hear
my
fellow
republicans
and
wonderful
people
like
them
they
all
want
me
to
support
them
they
know
how
to
bring
it
about
they
come
up
to
my
office
meeting
with
three
of
them
in
the
next
week
and
they
know
are
you
running
are
you
not
running
could
we
have
your
support
what
do
we
do
how
do
we
do
it
like
them
and
hear
their
speeches
and
they
talk
jobs
and
they
talk
china
when
was
the
last
time
you
heard
china
is
killing
us
devaluing
their
currency
to
level
that
you
believe
it
makes
it
impossible
for
our
companies
to
compete
impossible
killing
us
but
you
hear
that
from
anybody
else
you
hear
it
from
anybody
else
and
watch
the
speeches
thank
you
watch
the
speeches
of
these
people
and
they
say
the
sun
will
rise
the
moon
will
set
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
will
happen
and
people
are
saying
going
on
just
want
job
just
get
me
job
need
the
rhetoric
want
job
and
happening
and
going
to
get
worse
because
remember
really
kicks
in
in
is
going
to
be
out
playing
golf
he
might
be
on
one
of
my
courses
would
invite
him
actually
would
say
have
the
best
courses
in
the
world
so
say
you
what
if
he
wants
to
have
one
right
next
to
the
white
house
right
on
the
if
like
to
play
fine
in
fact
love
him
to
leave
early
and
play
that
would
be
very
good
thing
but
kicks
in
in
really
big
league
it
is
going
to
be
amazingly
destructive
doctors
are
quitting
have
friend
doctor
and
he
said
to
me
the
other
day
never
saw
anything
like
it
have
more
accountants
than
have
nurses
disaster
my
patients
are
beside
themselves
they
had
plan
that
was
good
they
have
no
plan
now
we
have
to
repeal
and
it
can
be
and
and
it
can
be
replaced
with
something
much
better
for
everybody
let
it
be
for
everybody
but
much
better
and
much
less
expensive
for
people
and
for
the
government
and
we
can
do
it
so
watched
the
politicians
dealt
with
them
all
my
life
if
you
make
good
deal
with
politician
then
something
wrong
with
you
certainly
not
very
good
and
what
we
representing
us
they
will
never
make
america
great
again
they
even
have
chance
controlled
fully
controlled
fully
by
the
lobbyists
by
the
donors
and
by
the
special
interests
fully
yes
they
control
them
hey
have
lobbyists
have
to
tell
you
have
lobbyists
that
can
produce
anything
for
me
great
but
you

love
my
life
have
wonderful
family
saying
dad
going
to
do
something
going
to
be
so
tough
you
know
all
of
my
life
heard
that
truly
successful
person
really
really
successful
person
and
even
modestly
successful
can
not
run
for
public
office
just
happen
and
yet
the
kind
of
mindset
that
you
need
to
make
this
country
great
again
so
ladies
and
gentlemen
am
officially
running
for
president
of
the
united
states
and
we
are
going
to
make
our
country
great
again
it
can
happen
our
country
has
tremendous
potential
we
have
tremendous
people
we
have
people
that
working
we
have
people
that
have
no
incentive
to
work
but
going
to
have
incentive
to
work
because
the
greatest
social
program
is
job
and
be
proud
and
love
it
and
make
much
more
than
they
ever
made
and
be
be
doing
so
well
and
going
to
be
thriving
as
country
thriving
it
can
happen
will
be
the
greatest
jobs
president
that
god
ever
created
tell
you
that
bring
back
our
jobs
from
china
from
mexico
from
japan
from
so
many
places
bring
back
our
jobs
and
bring
back
our
money
right
now
think
of
this
we
owe
china
trillion
we
owe
japan
more
than
that
so
they
come
in
they
take
our
jobs
they
take
our
money
and
then
they
loan
us
back
the
money
and
we
pay
them
in
interest
and
then
the
dollar
goes
up
so
their
even
better
how
stupid
are
our
leaders
how
stupid
are
these
politicians
to
allow
this
to
happen
how
stupid
are
they
going
to
tell
you
thank
you
going
to
tell
you
couple
of
stories
about
trade
because
totally
against
the
trade
bill
for
number
of
reasons
number
one
the
people
negotiating
have
clue
our
president
have
clue
bad
negotiator
the
one
that
did
we
get
they
get
five
killer
terrorists
that
everybody
wanted
over
there
we
get
we
get
traitor
we
get
traitor
and
they
get
the
five
people
that
they
wanted
for
years
and
those
people
are
now
back
on
the
battlefield
trying
to
kill
us
the
negotiator
we
have
take
look
at
the
deal
making
with
iran
he
makes
that
deal
israel
maybe
exist
very
long
disaster
and
we
have
to
protect
israel
but
so
we
need
people
free
trader
but
the
problem
with
free
trade
is
you
need
really
talented
people
to
negotiate
for
you
if
you
have
talented
people
if
you
have
great
leadership
if
you
have
people
that
know
business
not
just
political
hack
that
got
the
job
because
he
made
contribution
to
campaign
which
is
the
way
all
jobs
just
about
are
gotten
free
trade
terrible
free
trade
can
be
wonderful
if
you
have
smart
people
but
we
have
people
that
are
stupid
we
have
people
that
smart
and
we
have
people
that
are
controlled
by
special
interests
and
just
not
going
to
work
so
couple
of
stories
happened
recently
friend
of
mine
is
great
manufacturer
and
you
know
china
comes
over
and
they
dump
all
their
stuff
and
buy
it
buy
it
because
frankly
have
an
obligation
to
buy
it
because
they
devalue
their
currency
so
brilliantly
they
just
did
it
recently
and
nobody
thought
they
could
do
it
again
but
with
all
our
problems
with
russia
with
all
our
problems
with
everything
everything
they
got
away
with
it
again
and
impossible
for
our
people
here
to
compete
so
want
to
tell
you
this
story
friend
of
mine
great
manufacturer
calls
me
up
few
weeks
ago
very
upset
said
your
problem
he
said
you
know
make
great
product
and
said
know
know
that
because
buy
the
product
he
said
get
it
into
china
they
accept
it
sent
boat
over
and
they
actually
sent
it
back
they
talked
about
environmental
they
talked
about
all
sorts
of
crap
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
oh
wait
minute
terrible
does
anyone
know
this
he
said
yeah
they
do
it
all
the
time
with
other
people
said
they
send
it
back
yeah
so
finally
got
it
over
there
and
they
charged
me
big
tariff
not
supposed
to
be
doing
that
told
them
now
they
do
charge
you
tariff
on
trucks
when
we
send
trucks
and
other
things
over
there
ask
they
wanted
secrets
they
wanted
their
patents
and
all
their
secrets
before
they
agreed
to
buy
planes
from
hey
not
saying
stupid
like
china
sell
apartments
for
just
sold
an
apartment
for
million
to
somebody
from
china
am
supposed
to
dislike
them
own
big
chunk
of
the
bank
of
america
building
at
avenue
of
the
that
got
from
china
in
war
very
valuable
love
china
the
biggest
bank
in
the
world
is
from
china
you
know
where
their
united
states
headquarters
is
located
in
this
building
in
trump
tower
love
china
people
say
oh
you
like
china
no
love
them
but
their
leaders
are
much
smarter
than
our
leaders
and
we
sustain
with
that
too
much
like
like
take
the
new
england
patriots
and
and
have
them
play
your
high
school
football
team
the
difference
between
leaders
and
our
leaders
they
are
ripping
us
we
are
rebuilding
china
rebuilding
many
countries
china
you
go
there
now
roads
bridges
schools
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
they
have
bridges
that
make
the
george
washington
bridge
look
like
small
and
all
over
the
place
we
have
all
the
cards
but
we
know
how
to
use
them
we
even
know
that
we
have
the
cards
because
our
leaders
understand
the
game
we
could
turn
off
that
spigot
by
charging
them
tax
until
they
behave
properly
now
going
militarily
building
military
island
in
the
middle
of
the
south
china
sea
military
island
now
our
country
could
never
do
that
because
have
to
get
environmental
clearance
and
the
environmentalist
let
our
country
we
would
never
build
in
an
ocean
they
built
it
in
about
one
year
this
massive
military
port
building
up
their
military
to
point
that
is
very
scary
you
have
problem
with
isis
you
have
bigger
problem
with
china
and
in
my
opinion
the
new
china
believe
it
or
not
in
terms
of
trade
is
mexico
so
this
man
tells
me
about
the
manufacturing
say
terrible
story
hate
to
hear
it
but
have
another
one
ford
so
mexico
takes
company
car
company
that
was
going
to
build
in
rips
it
out
everybody
thought
the
deal
was
dead
reported
it
in
the
wall
street
journal
recently
everybody
thought
it
was
done
deal
going
in
and
going
to
be
it
going
into
great
state
great
all
of
sudden
at
the
last
moment
this
big
car
manufacturer
foreign
announces
not
going
to
spend
their
billion
in
mexico
instead
not
good
now
ford
announces
few
weeks
ago
that
ford
is
going
to
build
billion
car
and
truck
and
parts
manufacturing
plant
in
mexico
billion
going
to
be
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
ford
good
company
so
announced
that
running
for
president
would
one
of
the
early
things
would
do
probably
before
even
got
in
and
even
use
you
know
have
know
the
smartest
negotiators
in
the
world
know
the
good
ones
know
the
bad
ones
know
the
overrated
ones
you
get
lot
of
them
that
are
overrated
not
good
they
think
they
are
they
get
good
stories
because
the
newspapers
get
but
not
good
but
know
the
negotiators
in
the
world
and
put
them
one
for
each
country
believe
me
folks
we
will
do
very
very
well
very
very
well
but
even
waste
my
time
with
this
one
would
call
up
the
head
of
ford
who
know
if
was
president
say
congratulations
understand
that
building
nice
billion
car
factory
in
mexico
and
that
going
to
take
your
cars
and
sell
them
to
the
united
states
zero
tax
just
flow
them
across
the
border
and
you
say
to
yourself
how
does
that
help
us
right
how
does
that
help
us
where
is
that
good
not
so
would
say
congratulations
the
good
news
let
me
give
you
the
bad
news
every
car
and
every
truck
and
every
part
manufactured
in
this
plant
that
comes
across
the
border
going
to
charge
you
tax
and
that
tax
is
going
to
be
paid
simultaneously
with
the
transaction
and
it
now
what
is
going
to
happen
if
not
me
in
the
position
one
of
these
politicians
that
running
against
you
know
the
people
that
inaudible
and
going
to
happen
not
so
stupid
they
know
not
good
thing
and
they
may
even
be
upset
by
it
but
then
going
to
get
call
from
the
donors
or
probably
from
the
lobbyist
for
ford
and
say
you
do
that
to
ford
because
ford
takes
care
of
me
and
take
care
of
you
and
you
do
that
to
ford
and
guess
what
no
problem
going
to
build
in
mexico
going
to
take
away
thousands
of
jobs
very
bad
for
us
so
under
president
trump
what
would
happen
the
head
of
ford
will
call
me
back
would
say
within
an
hour
after
told
them
the
bad
news
but
it
could
be
want
to
be
cool
and
wait
until
the
next
day
you
know
they
want
to
be
little
cool
and
say
please
please
please
beg
for
little
while
and
say
no
interest
then
call
all
sorts
of
political
people
and
say
sorry
no
interest
because
need
money
nice
need
money
using
my
own
money
not
using
the
lobbyists
not
using
donors
care
really
rich
inaudible
and
by
the
way
not
even
saying
that
in
the
kind
of
mindset
the
kind
of
thinking
you
need
for
this
country
so
because
we
got
to
make
the
country
rich
it
sounds
crass
somebody
said
oh
crass
not
crass
we
got
trillion
in
debt
we
got
nothing
but
problems
we
got
military
that
needs
equipment
all
over
the
place
we
got
nuclear
weapons
that
are
obsolete
got
nothing
got
social
security
going
to
be
destroyed
if
somebody
like
me
bring
money
into
the
country
all
these
other
people
want
to
cut
the
hell
out
of
it
not
going
to
cut
it
at
all
going
to
bring
money
in
and
going
to
save
it
but
going
to
happen
after
called
by
friends
of
mine
who
contributed
to
different
campaigns
after
called
by
all
of
the
special
interests
and
by
the
the
donors
and
by
the
lobbyists
and
they
have
zero
chance
at
convincing
me
zero
get
call
the
next
day
from
the
head
of
ford
say
please
reconsider
say
no
say
president
decided
to
move
the
plant
back
to
the
united
states
and
not
going
to
build
it
in
mexico
it
they
have
no
choice
they
have
no
choice
there
are
hundreds
of
things
like
that
give
you
another
saudi
arabia
they
make
billion
day
billion
day
love
the
saudis
many
are
in
this
building
they
make
billion
dollars
day
whenever
they
have
problems
we
send
over
the
ships
we
say
protect
what
are
we
doing
got
nothing
but
money
if
the
right
person
asked
them
pay
fortune
they
be
there
except
for
us
and
believe
me
you
look
at
the
border
with
yemen
you
remember
year
ago
yemen
was
great
victory
two
weeks
later
the
place
was
blown
up
everybody
got
out
and
they
kept
our
equipment
they
always
keep
our
equipment
we
ought
to
send
used
equipment
right
they
always
keep
our
equipment
we
ought
to
send
some
real
junk
because
frankly
it
would
be
we
ought
to
send
our
surplus
always
losing
this
gorgeous
stuff
but
look
at
that
border
with
saudi
arabia
do
you
really
think
that
these
people
are
interested
in
yemen
saudi
arabia
without
us
is
gone
they
re
gone
and
the
one
that
made
all
of
the
right
predictions
about
iraq
you
know
all
of
these
politicians
that
running
against
now
so
nice
to
say
running
as
opposed
to
if
run
if
run
running
but
all
of
these
politicians
that
running
against
now
trying
to
disassociate
mean
you
looked
at
bush
it
took
him
five
days
to
answer
the
question
on
iraq
he
answer
the
question
he
know
said
is
he
intelligent
then
looked
at
he
was
unable
to
answer
the
question
is
iraq
good
thing
or
bad
thing
he
know
he
answer
the
question
how
are
these
people
lead
us
how
are
we
how
are
we
go
back
and
make
it
great
again
we
they
have
clue
they
lead
us
they
they
even
answer
simple
questions
it
was
terrible
but
saudi
arabia
is
in
big
big
trouble
now
thanks
to
and
other
things
the
oil
is
all
over
the
place
and
used
to
say
it
there
are
ships
at
sea
and
this
was
during
the
worst
crisis
that
were
loaded
up
with
oil
and
the
cartel
kept
the
price
up
because
again
they
were
smarter
than
our
leaders
they
were
smarter
than
our
leaders
there
is
so
much
wealth
out
there
that
can
make
our
country
so
rich
again
and
therefore
make
it
great
again
because
we
need
money
dying
dying
we
need
money
we
have
to
do
it
and
we
need
the
right
people
so
ford
will
come
back
all
come
back
and
will
say
this
this
is
going
to
be
an
election
in
my
opinion
based
on
competence
so
the
reporter
said
to
me
the
other
day
but
trump
not
nice
person
how
can
you
get
people
to
vote
for
you
said
know
said
think
that
number
one
am
nice
person
give
lot
of
money
away
to
charities
and
other
things
think
actually
very
nice
person
but
said
this
is
going
to
be
an
election
based
on
competence
because
people
are
tired
of
these
nice
people
and
tired
of
being
ripped
off
by
everybody
in
the
world
and
tired
of
spending
more
money
on
education
than
any
nation
in
the
world
per
capita
than
any
nation
in
the
world
and
we
are
in
the
world
countries
are
better
than
us
in
education
and
some
of
them
are
like
third
world
countries
but
becoming
third
word
country
because
of
our
infrastructure
our
airports
our
roads
everything
so
one
of
the
things
did
and
said
you
know
what
do
do
it
because
lot
of
people
said
never
run
number
one
he
want
to
give
up
his
lifestyle
right
about
that
but
doing
it
number
two
private
company
so
nobody
knows
what
worth
and
the
one
thing
is
that
when
you
run
you
have
to
announce
and
certify
to
all
sorts
of
governmental
authorities
your
net
worth
so
said
proud
of
my
net
worth
done
an
amazing
job
started
off
thank
you
started
off
in
small
office
with
my
father
in
brooklyn
and
queens
and
my
father
said
and
love
my
father
learned
so
much
he
was
great
negotiator
learned
so
much
just
sitting
at
his
feet
playing
with
blocks
listening
to
him
negotiate
with
subcontractors
but
learned
lot
but
he
used
to
say
go
into
the
big
leagues

know
anything
about
that
do
it
said
got

those
big
buildings

after
four
or
five

lot
of
great
deals

grand
hotel

lot
of
great

and

all
said
lot
of
the
pundits
on
television
well
will
never
run
and
one
of
the
main
reasons
is
private
and
probably
not
as
successful
as
everybody
thinks
so
said
to
myself
you
know
ever
going
to
know
unless
run
because
really
proud
of
my
success
really
am
employed
employed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
over
my
lifetime
that
means
medical
that
means
education
that
means
everything
so
large
accounting
firm
and
my
accountants
have
been
working
for
months
because
big
and
complex
and
put
together
statement
financial
statement
just
summary
but
everything
will
be
filed
eventually
with
the
government
and
we
extensions
or
anything
be
filing
it
right
on
time
we
need
anything
and
it
was
even
reported
incorrectly
yesterday
because
they
said
he
had
assets
of
billion
so
said
no
the
wrong
number
the
wrong
number
not
assets
so
they
put
together
this
and
before
say
it
have
to
say
this
made
it
the
way
real
estate
you
know
real
estate
and
unions
good
and
some
bad
and
lots
of
people
that
in
unions
and
all
over
the
place
and
building
all
over
the
world
and
have
assets
big
accounting
firm
one
of
the
most
highly
respected
billion
million
dollars
and
have
liabilities
of
about
million
debt
very
low
interest
rates
in
fact
one
of
the
big
banks
came
to
me
and
said
you
have
enough
borrowings
could
we
loan
you
billion
said
need
it
want
it
and
been
there
want
it
but
in
two
seconds
they
give
me
whatever
wanted
so
have
total
net
worth
and
now
with
the
increase
be
billion
but
here
total
net
worth
of
net
worth
not
assets
not
net
worth
after
all
debt
after
all
expenses
the
greatest
assets
trump
tower
avenue
of
the
bank
of
america
building
in
san
wall
street
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
trump
building
right
opposite
the
new
york
many
other
places
all
over
the
world
so
the
total
is
now
not
doing
that
not
doing
that
to
brag
because
you
know
what
have
to
brag
have
to
believe
it
or
not
doing
that
to
say
that
the
kind
of
thinking
our
country
needs
we
need
that
thinking
we
have
the
opposite
thinking
we
have
losers
we
have
losers
we
have
people
that
have
it
we
have
people
that
are
morally
corrupt
we
have
people
that
are
selling
this
country
down
the
drain
so
put
together
this
statement
and
the
only
reason
telling
you
about
it
today
is
because
we
really
do
have
to
get
going
because
if
we
have
another
three
or
four
years
you
know
at
trillion
now
soon
going
to
be
at
according
to
the
economists
who
not
big
believers
in
but
nevertheless
this
is
what
saying
that
trillion
very
close
the
point
of
no
return
trillion
we
will
be
there
soon
when
we
become
greece
when
we
become
country
and
be
there
very
soon
be
there
very
soon
will
immediately
terminate
president
illegal
executive
order
on
immigration
immediately
fully
support
and
back
up
the
second
amendment
now
very
interesting
today
heard
it
through
stupidity
in
very
very
hard
core
prison
interestingly
named
two
vicious
murderers
two
vicious
people
escaped
and
nobody
knows
where
they
are
and
woman
was
on
television
this
morning
and
she
said
you
know
trump
and
she
was
telling
other
people
and
actually
called
her
and
she
said
you
know
trump
always
was
against
guns
want
guns
and
now
since
this
happened
up
in
the
prison
area
my
husband
and
are
finally
in
agreement
because
he
wanted
the
guns
we
now
have
gun
on
every
table
ready
to
start
shooting
said
very
interesting
so
protect
the
second
amendment
end
end
common
core
common
core
should
it
is
disaster
bush
is
totally
in
of
common
core
see
how
he
can
possibly
get
the
nomination
weak
on
immigration
in
of
common
core
how
the
hell
can
you
vote
for
this
guy
you
just
do
it
we
have
to
end
education
has
to
be
local
rebuild
the
infrastructure
nobody
can
do
that
like
me
believe
me
it
will
be
done
on
time
on
budget
way
below
cost
way
below
what
anyone
ever
thought
look
at
the
roads
being
built
all
over
the
country
and
say
can
build
those
things
for
what
they
do
is
unbelievable
how
bad
you
know
building
on
avenue
the
old
post
office
converting
it
into
one
of
the
great
hotels
be
the
best
hotel
in
washington
we
got
it
from
the
general
services
administration
in
washington
the
administration
we
got
it
it
was
the
most
highly
sought
after
or
one
of
them
but
think
the
most
highly
sought
after
project
in
the
history
of
general
services
we
got
it
people
were
shocked
trump
got
it
well
got
it
for
two
reasons
number
one
really
good
number
two
we
had
really
good
plan
and
add
in
the
third
we
had
great
financial
statement
because
the
general
services
who
are
terrific
people
by
the
way
and
talented
people
they
wanted
to
do
great
job
and
they
wanted
to
make
sure
it
got
built
so
we
have
to
rebuild
our
infrastructure
our
bridges
our
roadways
our
airports
you
come
into
airport
like
in
third
world
country
you
look
at
the
patches
and
the
floor
they
throw
down
asphalt
and
they
throw
you
look
at
these
airports
we
are
like
third
world
country
and
come
in
from
china
and
come
in
from
qatar
and
come
in
from
different
places
and
they
have
the
most
incredible
airports
in
the
world
you
come
to
back
to
this
country
and
you
have
lax
disaster
you
have
all
of
these
disastrous
airports
we
have
to
rebuild
our
infrastructure
save
and
social
security
without
cuts
have
to
do
it
get
rid
of
the
fraud
get
rid
of
the
waste
and
abuse
but
save
it
people
have
been
paying
it
for
years
and
now
many
of
these
candidates
want
to
cut
it
you
save
it
by
making
the
united
states
by
making
us
rich
again
by
taking
back
all
of
the
money
being
lost
renegotiate
our
foreign
trade
deals
reduce
our
trillion
in
debt
because
believe
me
in
bubble
we
have
artificially
low
interest
rates
we
have
stock
market
that
frankly
has
been
good
to
me
but
still
hate
to
see
happening
we
have
stock
market
that
is
so
bloated
be
careful
of
bubble
because
what
seen
in
the
past
might
be
small
compared
to
what
happens
so
be
very
very
careful
and
strengthen
our
military
and
take
care
of
our
vets
so
so
important
thank
you
very
much
appreciate
it
this
has
been
an
amazing
evening
already
won
five
major
states
and
it
looks
like
we
could
win
six
or
seven
or
eight
or
nine
really
been
really
been
great
want
to
congratulation
ted
on
the
winning
of
texas
he
worked
hard
on
he
know
how
hard
he
worked
actually
and
so
congratulate
ted
on
that
win
that
was
an
excellent
win
going
to
make
america
great
again
folks
going
to
make
it
great
again
and
you
know
watched
and
talking
about
wages
have
been
poor
and
poor
and
doing
badly
but
going
to
make
it
been
there
for
so
long
mean
if
she
straightened
it
out
by
now
not
going
to
straighten
it
out
in
the
next
four
years
just
going
to
become
worse
and
worse
she
wants
to
make
america
whole
again
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
is
that
all
about
make
america
great
again
is
going
to
be
much
better
than
making
america
whole
again
so
just
want
to
say
that
this
was
an
exciting
evening
so
great
to
be
in
florida
so
great
to
be
at
with
friends
and
the
press
and
the
media
and
everybody
know
it
was
very
tough
night
for
he
had
tough
night
but
he
worked
hard
he
spent
lot
of
money
he
is
lightweight
as
said
many
times
before
but
you
know
what
going
to
go
to
florida
going
to
spend
so
much
time
in
florida
got
about
lead
know
that
lot
of
groups
lot
of
the
special
interests
and
lot
of
the
lobbyists
and
the
people
that
want
to
have
their
little
senator
do
exactly
as
they
want
going
to
put
million
or
million
into
it
over
the
next
two
weeks
from
what
just
came
over
the
wires
and
frankly
think
fine
as
far
as
concerned
fine
and
if
he
wins
have
totally
controlled
total
control
but
not
going
anywhere
anyway
but
see
what
happens
but
going
to
spend
lot
of
time
in
florida
the
virginia
one
was
just
great
win
because
place
that
is
just
spectacular
and
place
that
we
have
big
investments
in
as
we
have
in
florida
remember
we
have
thousands
of
employees
in
florida
all
along
miami
and
and
so
many
other
places
and
been
an
amazing
place
to
invest
been
amazing
to
have
so
many
wonderful
employees
so
many
of
whom
are
here
tonight
really
urging
us
on
and
you
know
have
thousands
of
employees
all
over
the
country
actually
all
over
the
world
but
for
purposes
of
tonight
just
say
all
over
the
country
and
been
just
so
beautiful
to
watch
this
company
grow
and
to
watch
it
grow
so
strongly
recent
articles
came
out
talking
about
how
great
company
we
built
and
now
we
want
to
put
that
same
ability
into
doing
something
for
our
nation
mean
our
nation
is
in
serious
trouble
being
chilled
on
trade
absolutely
destroyed
china
is
just
taking
advantage
of
us
have
nothing
against
china
have
great
respect
for
china
but
their
leaders
are
too
smart
for
our
leaders
our
leaders
have
clue
and
the
trade
deficits
at
billion
and
are
too
much
no
country
can
sustain
that
kind
of
trade
deficit
it
be
that
way
for
long
we
have
the
greatest
business
leaders
in
the
world
on
my
team
already
and
believe
me
going
to
redo
those
trade
deals
and
going
to
be
thing
of
beauty
you
look
at
countries
like
mexico
where
killing
us
on
the
border
absolutely
destroying
us
on
the
border
destroying
us
in
terms
of
economic
development
companies
like
carrier
air
conditioner
just
moving
into
mexico
ford
moving
into
mexico
closing
up
shop
in
chicago
and
moving
into
mexico
we
have
to
stop
it
folks
know
how
to
stop
it
going
to
create
jobs
going
to
create
jobs
like
never
seen
going
to
lower
taxes
have
plan
that
and
so
many
others
think
is
the
best
plan
seen
going
to
lower
taxes
substantially
for
the
middle
class
the
middle
class
has
been
forgotten
in
our
country
it
really
helped
and
really
probably
was
the
predominant
factor
in
making
our
country
into
country
that
we
all
love
so
much
and
all
so
proud
of
but
forgotten
the
middle
class
so
going
to
lower
taxes
lowering
taxes
on
business
you
look
at
all
the
companies
that
are
moving
out
when
you
see
moving
to
ireland
and
you
see
so
many
other
companies
constantly
now
leaving
they
used
to
move
from
new
york
to
florida
or
move
from
new
jersey
to
else
but
now
moving
from
here
not
that
many
people
are
leaving
new
jersey
but
understands
the
problem
fully
understands
now
leaving
from
places
that
they
used
to
move
to
into
other
parts
of
the
world
we
let
that
happen
lost
our
manufacturing
jobs
lost
our
manufacturing
millions
and
millions
of
jobs
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
plants
manufacturing
plants
warehouses
mean
we
are
losing
so
much
we
let
it
happen
tell
the
story
often
about
friend
of
mine
who
is
in
the
excavation
business
and
he
always
orders
caterpillar
and
recently
he
ordered
tractors
from
japan
because
cut
the
yen
devalued
the
yen
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
caterpillar
to
compete
and
want
that
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
they
be
allowed
to
do
it
we
have
tremendous
power
over
everybody
because
we
are
really
the
source
we
have
great
great
power
the
problem
is
we
have
politicians
who
truly
truly
truly
know
what
doing
so
going
to
work
very
very
hard
so
by
this
evening
if
you
told
me
on
june
when
was
with
my
wife
and
we
came
down
the
escalator
in
trump
tower
and
it
looked
literally
well
little
bit
like
this
you
have
lot
of
cameras
here
tonight
it
looked
literally
like
the
academy
awards
never
saw
so
many
cameras
in
my
life
and
it
takes
courage
to
run
tell
you
what
it
takes
lot
of
courage
to
run
for
president
never
done
this
before
been
done
lot
of
things
but
this
is
something
never
done
but
felt
we
had
to
do
it
when
you
look
at
the
incompetence
of
the
iran
deal
where
we
give
billion
we
get
absolutely
nothing
when
you
look
at
all
of
the
problems
our
country
has
and
you
look
at
our
military
which
is
really
being
depleted
rapidly
depleted
going
to
make
our
military
bigger
and
better
and
stronger
than
ever
before
and
nobody
nobody
nobody
is
going
to
mess
with
us
folks
nobody
so
just
an
amazing
to
have
you
with
me
tonight
and
if
you
want
press
think
we
told
you
before
be
okay
if
you
want
to
ask
few
questions
yes
go
ahead
well
they
can
always
do
that
and
then
then
just
lose
everything
and
that
would
be
the
that
would
be
the
work
of
loser
but
let
me
just
explain
something
if
seen
happened
whether
you
go
to
south
where
had
huge
victory
where
we
had
tremendous
victory
in
new
tremendous
in
you
look
at
happened
and
tonight
of
course
is
the
best
of
all
mean
right
now
projected
guess
six
but
we
could
be
seven
eight
nine
and
major
states
georgia
alabama
cheers
virginia
and
you
know
these
are
amazing
states
and
going
to
probably
get
lot
more
in
fact
projected
to
have
some
pretty
good
additional
numbers
but
will
say
this
look
we
have
expanded
the
republican
party
when
you
look
at
happened
in
south
and
you
see
the
kind
of
numbers
that
we
got
in
terms
of
extra
people
coming
in
they
came
from
the
democratic
party
or
the
democrat
party
and
democrats
and
democrats
and
they
were
never
going
to
switch
and
they
all
switched
and
they
were
independents
and
actually
expanded
the
party
look
at
the
number
of
votes
we
had
in
that
area
as
an
example
four
years
ago
they
had
or
so
votes
we
doubled
it
we
were
almost
whereas
the
democrats
went
down
much
less
enthusiasm
for
the
democrats
so
look
unifier
know
people
are
going
to
find
that
little
bit
hard
to
believe
but
believe
me
am
unifier
once
we
get
all
of
this
finished
going
to
go
after
one
person
on
the
assumption
allowed
to
run
which
is
big
assumption
know
that
going
to
be
allowed
to
run
and
think
frankly
going
to
be
an
easy
race
you
see
the
polls
beat
in
many
polls
know
one
thing
think
is
going
to
be
able
to
beat
her
think
in
all
fairness
think
going
to
have
very
hard
time
but
ted
at
least
has
shot
because
at
least
won
little
bit
so
just
tell
you
this
we
are
going
to
be
much
finer
party
much
going
to
be
unified
party
mean
to
be
honest
with
you
and
we
are
going
to
be
much
bigger
party
and
you
can
see
that
happening
going
to
be
much
bigger
party
our
party
is
expanding
and
all
you
have
to
do
it
take
look
at
the
primary
states
where
won
and
just
look
gone
from
number
to
much
larger
number
that
happened
to
the
republican
party
in
many
many
decades
so
think
going
to
be
more
inclusive
think
going
to
be
more
unified
and
think
going
to
be
much
bigger
party
and
think
going
to
win
in
november
ok
yeah
just
doing
right
look
planned
parenthood
has
done
very
good
work
for
some
for
many
many
for
millions
of
women
and
say
it
and
know
lot
of
the
conservatives
they
say
really
because
conservative
but
conservative
but
millions
of
women
have
been
helped
by
planned
parenthood
but
not
going
to
allow
and
not
going
to
fund
as
long
as
you
have
the
abortion
going
on
at
planned
parenthood
and
we
understand
that
and
said
it
loud
and
clear
but
and
see
what
happens
but
planned
parenthood
millions
of
people
and
had
thousands
of
letters
from
women
that
have
been
helped
and
this
setup
this
was
people
writing
letters
going
to
be
really
good
for
women
going
to
be
good
for
health
issues
very
important
to
me
very
important
to
me
and
maybe
not
perfect
conservative
view
but
can
tell
you
one
thing
more
conservative
than
anybody
on
the
military
on
taking
care
of
our
vets
on
the
border
on
the
wall
on
getting
rid
of
and
coming
up
with
something
much
much
better
and
certainly
getting
rid
of
common
core
and
bringing
education
to
local
level
so
that
going
to
have
good
education
for
our
children
who
are
being
absolutely
starved
for
proper
education
so
mean
you
know
you
can
call
it
what
you
want
but
am
and
will
tell
the
truth
ok
yeah
go
ahead
finish
it
feel
awfully
good
mean
watching
your
people
watching
your
people
on
and
going
to
be
very
nice
going
to
be
very
nice
watching
your
people
on
and
watching
the
fox
people
and
watching
the
people
too
ok
see
becoming
diplomatic
and
they
are
certainly
being
very
nice
to
me
tonight
mean
you
know
being
very
strong
and
they
are
declaring
the
big
loser
of
the
night
which
is
true
he
win
anything
he
won
anything
period
and
by
the
way
and
have
to
tell
you
and
he
was
very
very
nasty
never
heard
person
get
up
and
speak
on
an
evening
like
this
and
be
so
nasty
but
got
right
to
be
nasty
he
won
anything
and
not
going
to
win
very
much
but
do
congratulate
ted
because
know
how
hard
ted
worked
on
texas
and
big
get
now
also
did
very
well
in
texas
came
in
second
and
one
of
the
things
my
son
told
me
which
even
is
that
not
only
did
win
most
of
the
states
and
some
are
coming
in
and
expected
to
win
them
but
came
in
second
came
in
no
worse
than
second
so
it
like
won
and
then
disappeared
the
worst
had
was
second
so
very
very
by
the
turnout
ok
yes
go
ahead
right
oh
totally
wrong
look
disavowed
disavowed
when
in
fact
is
my
number
one
gave
me
the
of
joining
the
campaign
he
called
me
he
said
what
got
is
movement
we
spoke
today
in
kentucky
never
seen
crowd
like
that
that
had
to
be
people
inside
this
massive
convention
and
it
was
incredible
and
every
place
speaking
if
we
have
people
like
small
group
we
had
people
the
other
day
in
alabama
and
when
called
he
said
this
is
movement
this
is
something
like
never
seen
and
in
all
fairness
to
the
press
lot
of
the
press
have
said
the
same
thing
never
seen
happening
right
now
never
seen
anything
like
it
and
just
by
it
now
when
joined
we
had
news
conference
and
they
asked
me
the
exact
same
question
said
disavow
now
right
after
the
program
that
talking
about
and
thought
it
was
clear
but
you
know
talking
about
groups
groups
groups
do
have
to
know
the
name
of
the
group
because
who
knows
mean
they
have
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
group
but
right
after
when
reviewed
it
put
out
tweet
and
put
out
on
that
totally
disavow
now
everybody
knew
did
that
but
the
press
refused
to
look
at
that
it
was
right
after
and
disavowed
then
disavowed
today
on
with
george
disavowed
again
mean
how
many
times
are
you
supposed
to
disavow
but
disavow
and
hopefully
the
final
time
have
to
do
it
but
if
you
look
at
and
if
you
look
at
twitter
right
after
the
show
put
out
statement
because
want
everybody
to
be
sure
yes
go
ahead
no
not
but
there
is
always
going
to
be
some
negotiation
and
going
to
be
good
negotiation
not
bad
negotiation
going
to
be
negotiation
where
start
at
certain
levels
and
hopefully
will
make
great
deal
and
lots
of
great
deals
for
the
american
people
so
you
know
look
you
go
around
just
signing
our
little
notices
that
the
president
signs
all
the
time
executive
orders
done
executive
order
executive
order
almost
like
even
know
does
he
ever
go
deal
with
congress
anymore
does
he
ever
speak
to
the
senate
does
he
ever
speak
with
congressmen
and
get
them
into
room
and
get
things
done
you
know
good
example
of
this
in
all
fairness
is
something
that
is
very
very
important
to
me
corporate
inversion
friend
of
mine
who
endorsed
me
great
businessman
he
it
bothers
him
so
much
he
calls
me
about
it
all
the
time
where
losing
companies
and
losing
for
two
reasons
losing
for
lot
of
reasons
but
the
taxes
are
too
high
we
have
the
highest
the
highest
taxed
nation
in
the
world
and
very
importantly
they
have
trillions
for
companies
trillions
of
dollars
outside
of
this
country
the
democrats
agree
it
should
be
brought
back
in
the
republicans
agree
it
should
be
brought
back
in
everybody
agrees
it
should
be
brought
back
in
could
sit
in
room
or
the
oval
office
for
period
of
literally
half
hour
and
really
believe
could
get
everybody
every
single
you
know
one
thing
they
agree
on
health
care
or
they
agree
on
common
core
or
they
agree
on
other
things
and
fight
something
every
single
mean
almost
everybody
agrees
these
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
should
be
brought
into
the
country
the
president
make
deal
the
reason
is
he
know
how
to
make
deal
probably
work
at
it
probably
care
but
talking
about
tremendous
number
of
tremendous
amounts
of
money
so
when
you
have
something
that
everybody
wants
and
you
make
deal
something
going
on
really
wrong
and
what
it
means
is
you
have
the
wrong
leader
yes
well
look
everything
we
are
going
to
have
wall
can
tell
you
we
are
going
to
have
wall
watched
the
of
mexico
the
arrogance
of
this
man
and
get
along
great
with
you
saw
in
won
in
the
poll
the
hispanic
vote
have
thousands
of
people
that
work
for
me
right
now
that
are
hispanic
had
thousands
and
thousands
over
my
lifetime
these
are
great
people
the
mexican
leaders
are
too
smart
for
our
leaders
and
you
saw
it
fox
first
of
all
he
used
word
that
you
should
never
have
if
ever
used
that
word
you
folks
never
ever
ever
let
me
get
away
with
it
nobody
even
talked
about
the
word
he
used
and
this
is
the
ultimate
word
but
he
was
angry
at
the
concept
of
somebody
saying
that
they
were
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
mexico
is
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
we
have
trade
deficit
with
mexico
of
billion
year
billion
the
wall
is
going
to
cost
billion
so
easy
had
these
guys
that
on
the
stage
with
go
you
really
mean
mexico
is
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
one
as
sure
as
standing
there
percent
going
to
pay
percent
and
the
reason
is
businessman
know
how
to
do
this
politicians
are
all
talk
no
action
not
going
to
except
for
of
course
not
look
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
with
these
people
so
when
you
think
of
it
and
then
they
say
never
be
able
to
build
wall
well
miles
but
we
really
need
miles
the
great
wall
of
china
built
years
ago
is
miles
folks
and
they
have
caterpillar
tractors
because
only
want
to
use
caterpillar
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
or
john
buy
lot
of
equipment
from
john
love
john
too
but
they
have
tractors
they
have
cranes
they
have
excavation
equipment
the
wall
is
miles
long
we
need
miles
and
we
have
all
of
the
materials
we
can
do
that
so
beautifully
and
this
is
going
to
be
serious
wall
this
is
going
to
be
high
wall
this
is
going
to
be
very
serious
wall
going
to
stop
drugs
from
coming
into
new
you
know
when
won
new
those
people
were
so
incredible
to
me
and
when
you
go
you
believe
it
because
so
bucolic
so
beautiful
you
look
at
the
fields
and
you
look
at
everything
so
beautiful
and
yet
you
go
to
meeting
in
new
their
number
one
problem
their
number
one
problem
is
heroine
the
heroine
is
pouring
in
and
they
have
so
many
of
their
young
people
and
other
people
addicted
and
told
them
going
to
stop
it
going
to
stop
it
going
to
have
strong
border
and
mean
strong
and
by
the
way
speaking
of
people
people
are
going
to
come
in
and
going
to
come
into
this
country
but
going
to
come
in
legally
ok
got
to
find
out
going
on
got
big
problem
we
have
big
big
problem
tell
it
like
it
is
we
have
big
big
problem
got
to
figure
it
out
going
to
figure
it
out
radical
islamic
terrorism
big
big
problem
not
only
for
us
you
take
look
at
germany
you
take
look
at
sweden
you
take
look
at
brussels
you
look
at
some
of
these
places
like
disaster
and
not
going
to
allow
people
to
come
into
our
country
who
we
have
no
idea
who
they
are
we
have
no
idea
where
they
come
from
they
have
no
paperwork
young
and
strong
you
look
at
that
migration
line
young
strong
powerful
and
you
say
why
they
back
fighting
for
their
country
now
with
all
of
that
being
said
feel
strongly
have
bigger
heart
than
anybody
going
to
build
safe
zone
going
to
be
in
syria
and
going
to
get
the
gulf
states
who
have
more
money
than
anybody
got
to
loosen
up
their
wallets
little
bit
going
to
get
but
not
accepting
people
going
to
get
wait
wait
wait
going
to
get
the
gulf
states
to
pay
for
it
because
they
should
oh
going
to
bring
them
back
going
to
bring
them
back
look
telling
you
you
know
how
going
to
bring
them
back
first
of
all
going
to
do
great
with
the
americans
and
you
see
that
in
the
polls
where
had
in
one
poll
where
percent
and
one
of
the
commentators
who
think
is
standing
right
at
the
back
of
the
room
in
the
corner
said
you
know
if
trump
gets
percent
of
the
vote
this
election
is
over
you
watch
and
the
reason
getting
that
and
going
to
do
great
with
the
going
to
do
great
with
virtually
every
group
the
reason
is
going
to
bring
jobs
back
going
to
get
apple
to
start
making
their
computers
and
their
on
our
land
not
in
china
how
does
it
help
us
when
they
make
it
in
china
well
look
always
liked
until
about
week
ago
when
he
decided
to
go
hostile
he
decided
to
become
don
ok
but
don
has
lot
more
talent
honestly
did
always
liked
him
but
he
became
you
know
somebody
told
him
losing
very
badly
the
only
way
you
can
possibly
win
take
the
hail
mary
they
called
it
hail
mary
the
folks
in
the
back
and
go
hostile
hurt
him
in
fact
one
of
the
tonight
said
he
went
down
or
percent
really
hurt
him
but
look
not
going
to
tell
him
what
to
do
not
going
to
tell
anybody
what
to
do
you
have
to
run
he
had
bad
night
according
to
fox
watched
their
broadcasts
they
say
the
loser
of
the
night
was
and
true
he
win
anything
he
won
mean
at
least
you
can
say
that
ted
has
won
something
and
you
know
has
not
won
got
to
be
able
to
win
you
talk
you
know
these
politicians
all
talk
no
action
got
to
be
able
to
win
something
he
won
anything
and
he
actually
come
very
close
so
see
what
happens
yes
go
ahead
going
to
be
good
president
for
the
world
but
we
have
country
in
big
trouble
our
infrastructure
is
going
to
hell
our
roads
our
highways
our
schools
our
hospitals
our
airports
go
throughout
the
world
mean
you
go
to
qatar
you
go
to
some
people
say
qatar
but
you
go
to
qatar
you
go
to
any
of
so
many
places
you
go
to
different
places
in
china
different
places
in
asia
different
places
in
the
middle
east
you
look
at
some
of
the
airports
they
have
you
look
at
the
roadways
they
have
you
look
at
the
transportation
systems
they
have
and
the
trains
they
have
like
third
world
country
so
am
going
to
be
very
good
for
the
world
going
to
get
along
with
the
world
going
to
be
very
proud
of
me
even
you
will
be
very
proud
of
me
as
president
but
we
have
to
rebuild
our
country
our
country
is
going
to
hell
and
people
understand
that
and
have
clue
she
do
that
talking
about
mean
one
of
the
things
that
has
really
bothered
me
think
one
of
the
reasons
have
such
great
support
is
that
people
you
take
look
people
in
the
groups
are
making
less
money
today
less
money
than
they
made
years
ago
and
in
her
she
just
said
making
less
money
well
been
there
with
for
long
period
of
time
why
she
done
anything
about
it
practically
everything
that
she
was
complaining
about
picked
up
what
say
the
difference
is
been
there
for
long
period
of
time
why
they
done
anything
about
it
then
you
look
at
her
record
as
secretary
of
state
abysmal
you
look
at
going
on
with
syria
you
look
at
going
on
with
everything
disaster
so
going
to
have
an
interesting
period
of
time
know
that
going
to
be
allowed
to
run
what
she
did
is
criminal
act
if
allowed
to
run
would
be
very
very
surprised
but
if
allowed
to
run
honestly
be
sad
day
for
this
country
because
what
she
did
was
wrong
and
what
she
did
cheers
let
me
just
tell
you
what
she
did
was
wrong
and
other
people
have
done
far
less
than
her
and
they
paid
very
very
big
price
ok
one
or
two
more
questions
yeah
go
ahead
at
this
moment
absolutely
not
no
we
either
have
country
or
we
we
have
country
or
we
we
have
borders
or
we
have
borders
and
at
this
moment
the
answer
is
absolutely
not
well
look
expect
have
lot
of
respect
for
and
for
the
group
and
like
the
and
know
that
been
treated
fairly
or
not
really
know
tell
you
that
but
can
tell
you
that
do
respect
them
what
really
have
is
great
number
of
people
have
millions
and
millions
of
people
and
when
was
watching
this
broadcast
just
little
while
ago
before
came
in
here
because
wanted
to
see
exactly
where
we
were
before
started
speaking
was
amazed
at
the
kind
of
numbers
the
republicans
have
tremendous
energy
the
democrats
they
have
any
energy
their
numbers
are
down
our
number
are
through
the
roof
and
people
are
making
the
statements
never
seen
in
modern
times
party
that
was
so
think
if
somebody
is
doing
as
well
as
doing
and
not
just
speaking
for
myself
whether
it
be
me
or
anybody
else
but
if
going
to
win
five
already
won
five
but
maybe
it
could
be
six
seven
eight
nine
it
could
be
nine
could
win
nine
states
tonight
if
going
to
win
all
of
these
states
with
tremendous
numbers
and
if
going
to
come
in
the
worst
is
second
in
the
two
or
three
that
might
not
win
think
you
know
democracy
think
awfully
hard
to
say
not
the
person
we
want
to
lead
the
party
right
you
know
very
hard
but
really
think
that
think
great
question
david
because
really
think
that
one
of
the
biggest
things
that
everybody
is
seeing
happening
and
everybody
is
the
republican
party
has
become
more
dynamic
become
more
diverse
taking
from
the
democrats
taking
from
the
independents
we
have
lot
more
people
we
have
lot
more
people
mean
take
look
at
south
look
at
the
numbers
look
at
the
numbers
from
four
years
ago
when
nobody
even
wanted
to
waste
their
time
and
vote
and
then
you
look
at
was
there
and
you
had
lines
that
went
mile
long
and
it
was
virtually
more
than
doubled
so
we
have
very
very
dynamic
party
and
think
going
to
be
able
to
unify
the
party
hope
to
be
able
to
get
along
with
everybody
know
paul
well
but
hope
to
be
able
to
get
along
with
him
do
know
little
bit
but
hope
to
be
able
to
get
along
with
him
but
remember
this
have
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
people
this
like
close
match
mean
only
too
bad
that
winner
take
all
because
if
winner
took
all
this
thing
is
over
just
having
celebration
you
know
having
celebration
so
anyway
would
like
to
look
just
want
to
end
by
thanking
everybody
this
has
been
an
amazing
period
in
my
life
my
wife
just
called
and
as
you
know
is
going
to
be
having
baby
very
soon
and
special
person
and
going
to
be
great
and
we
look
forward
to
that
back
in
new
york
she
wanted
to
be
here
they
all
wanted
to
be
here
but
with
now
and
that
could
be
certainly
within
the
next
week
but
this
this
has
been
an
amazing
period
of
time
been
amazing
for
me
even
from
an
educational
standpoint
and
think
honestly
done
something
that
almost
nobody
thought
could
be
done
and
very
proud
of
it
and
just
want
to
leave
you
with
this
am
unifier
would
love
to
see
the
republican
party
and
everybody
get
together
and
unify
and
when
we
unify
nobody
nobody
going
to
beat
us
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
this
is
so
so
incredible
we
we
have
had
no
matter
where
we
go
you
know
movement
folks
this
is
movement
no
matter
where
we
go
amazing
we
go
to
dallas
we
go
to
oklahoma
we
go
all
over
we
went
to
the
other
night
packed
every
place
new
packed
every
place
we
go
to
like
this
amazing
and
just
great
great
people
and
they
actually
had
to
tell
over
people
go
home
come
back
do
another
one
but
they
had
to
go
home
would
you
like
to
leave
and
let
them
come
in
no
think
so
but
we
they
turned
away
lot
of
people
which
is
too
bad
actually
so
maybe
next
time
know
think
this
is
the
largest
room
know
record
for
the
room
you
know
it
has
to
be
record
because
every
inch
of
the
room
is
taken
with
people
and
standing
not
sitting
so
great
love
we
love
setting
records
we
want
the
country
to
set
records
right
so
you
know
do
this
and
love
to
do
it
and
talk
about
our
success
because
ultimately
what
all
about
think
going
to
do
well
in
really
think
going
to
do
great
there
and
could
say
oh
if
we
came
in
the
top
four
of
five
not
looking
to
win
everything
we
want
to
run
the
table
we
want
to
run
it
because
that
sends
signal
and
you
know
been
little
bit
we
had
to
respond
to
she
came
out
with
that
she
came
out
remember
she
wrote
she
said
got
demonstrated
penchant
demonstrated
penchant
for
sexism
can
you
believe
it
me
nobody
respects
women
more
than
trump
that
can
tell
you
and
you
know
when
she
said
that
had
no
choice
because
start
it
had
no
choice
and
did
have
to
mention
her
situation
ok
laughter
and
that
is
now
the
biggest
story
on
television
by
factor
of
so
we
have
to
do
it
you
let
people
push
you
around
you
let
people
tell
lies
you
do
it
you
know
interesting
one
of
the
polls
came
out
from
and
they
said
that
if
trump
against
in
the
election
it
will
be
the
greatest
voter
turnout
in
the
history
of
this
country
can
see
that
can
see
it
and
they
said
all
of
these
people
that
are
going
to
come
in
new
that
never
vote
they
never
vote
they
care
going
to
mostly
tell
you
what
going
to
vote
for
trump
why
coming
in
because
so
fed
up
with
the
system
this
corrupt
horrible
system
fed
up
with
it
and
fed
up
with
those
guys
back
there
the
media
trump
they
are
the
worst
no

no
fed
up
fed
up
with
the
media
mean
got
and
you
know
not
all
bad
but
so
much
dishonesty
in
the
media
and
like
to
call
it
out
and
one
of
the
things
really
been
amazing
to
me
and
such
been
so
beautiful
to
watch
the
level
of
genius
in
the
public
they
get
it
you
know
they
really
get
it
they
want
to
us
they
want
to
do
all
of
this
and
they
want
to
make
everybody
look
like

level
of
genius
they
fully
understand
they
know
crooked

know
dishonest
and
they
really
otherwise
who
gets
worse
publicity
than
me
laughter
and
yet
see
poll
at
percent
and
you
know
talking
about
people
started
with
how
are
you
started
with
people
and
you
know
be
happy
with
if
we
had
three
ok
not
thrilled
like
to
be
that
over
that
mark
but
think
doing
really
well
and
you
know
interesting
but
the
debates
ok
so

too
darling
laughter
love

what
the
rooms
no
matter
where
whether
stadiums
or
big
ballrooms
like
this
one
amazing
and
love
in
the
room
and
told
the
other
night
said
and
friend
of
mine
very
very
successful
guy
who
would
love
to
have
negotiating
against
china
what
we
need
not
these
hacks
that
we
have
no
no
have
guys
endorsed
me
great
business
man
we
have
have
great
great
business
people
that
want
to
be
involved
and
going
to
use
we
have
the
best
we
have
the
best
in
the
world
we
use
them
we
use
political
hacks
we
use
special
interest
people
that
really
care
about
the
country
they
care
about
their
deals
this
is
going
to
change
so
fast
you
know
last
year
billion
trade
deficit
with
china
think
about
it
you
know
what
billion
is
you
do
you
do
bills
you
would
fill
the
room
to
the
ceiling
billion
deficit
trade
deficit
with
china
what
are
we
are
we
yes
guess
the
answer
is
certainly
not
blame
us
our
leaders
are
stupid
and
you
have
to
say
they
have
deals
because
happened
is
all
of
this
money
is
being
given
to
them
by
special
interests
by
all
of
these
people
including
lobbyists
and
these
lobbyists
make
our
leaders
do
our
leaders
can
you
believe
our
leaders
this
is
what
but
they
make
the
leaders
of
our
country
do
things
that
they
even
want
to
do
because
given
them
tens
and
tens
and
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
look
at
this
guy
bush
he
spent
million
on
his
campaign
and
he
is
down
in
the
grave
he
is
nowhere
no
no
think
of
it
got
to
be
much
more
than
that
it
was
actually
million
while
ago
every
time
turn
on
an
add
see
an
about
trump
mean
not
that
bad
an
either
like
you
know
if
going
to
do
an
do
an
but
person
face
it
we
need
we
need
lots
of
energy
but
he
spent
think
of
it
think
of
it
he
spent
million
spent
nothing
right
nothing
now
going
to
be
spending
you
probably
saw
going
to
spend
now
going
to
start
spending
lot
of
money
because
want
to
take
any
chances
you
know
love
getting
up
and
for
the
last
couple
of
months
have
been
leading
from
practically
the
time
announced
right
and
for
the
last
and
leading
lot
going
to
go
over
that
because
go
over
polls
love
polls
love
polls
now
when
they
if
they
turn
negative
like
them
and
promise
if
they
turn
negative
not
going
to
be
talking
about
them
in
fact
get
all
the
time
always
talking
about
your
polls
one
of
these
guys
just
got
two
at
two
at
and
one
of
these
guys
at
two
said
he
always
talks
about
his
polls
and
either
if
had
two
swear
do
it
at
all
but
you
know
love
to
tell
the
story
where
have
spent
nothing
and
bush
has
spent
million
but
much
higher
than
that
just
you
know
because
see
since
then
mean
just
you
turn
on
this
television
without
these
commercials
and
fox
every
two
minutes
commercial
on
trump
you
know
what
he
did
false
advertising
so
killed
him
in
the
debate
according
to
according
to
everybody
drudge
an
amazing
guy
by
the
way
if
you
know
drudge
matt
drudge
right
great
guy
but
drudge
percent
at
percent
you
have
people
now
if
you
noticed
couple
have
dropped
out
couple
or
more
but
people
percent
time
magazine
percent
think
of
it
slate
percent
news
and
world
report
percent
said
won
the
debate
wont
the
debate
right
public
broadcasting
system
percent
said
trump
won
no
you
know
it
is
amazing
we
have
washington
times
at
percent
percent
fox
percent
fox
las
percent
so
they
all
say
then
they
go
back
home
after
the
debate
like
to
see
how
did
do
did
look
good
looking
good
is
very
important
right
sometimes
it
is
not
as
much
like
what
you
say
how
did
you
look
oh
looked
good
sound
too
good
but
that
is
you
wonder
if
that
is
good
trait
but
go
home
and
watch
and
the
pundits
will
say
and
they
totally
kill
me
because
we
know
it
is
happening
we
know
happening
well
trump
was
ok
tonight
he
was
won
every
single
poll
won
and
then
bush
so
bush
does
an
and
he
takes
me
and
he
was
talking
about
you
know
something
and
manage
and
then
killed
him
mean
he
by
the
way
met
percent
he
is
at
percent
he
got
he
came
in
last
he
takes
the
and
even
talk
about
him
down
to
two
or
three
but
it
bothers
me
when
see
guy
spending
you
know
million
on
against
me
lot
of
it
right
say
why
is
he
doing
this
he
have
something
better
he
should
go
home
just
relax
you
know
honestly
he
should
go
home
and
relax
he
be
wasting
his
time
but
it
does
say
why
is
this
guy
spending
all
this
money
now
he
is
spending
it
actually
against
couple
of
other
guys
they
were
also
very
weak
and
somewhere
but
here
is
my
so
he
made
statement
and
after
that
his
spin
people
said
oh
he
was
great
he
took
on
trump
he
took
on
trump
standing
here
over
here
took
on
trump
he
made
statement
that
was
written
by
his
pollster
you
know
so
he
would
remember
it
he
said
trump
why
you
this
said
then
gave
him
an
answer
said
at
you
are
at
right
it
is
simple
answer
you
started
off
here
right
next
to
me
and
then
you
were
there
then
you
were
there
by
the
next
time
you
are
going
to
be
off
the
stage
right
no
no
true
and
then
and
then
and
that
was
it
and
so
responded
so
he
asked
me
question
question
was
fine
you
know
professionally
written
so
he
asked
me
question
good
give
him
an
answer
blow
him
away
right
everyone
says
trump
won
the
debate
everybody
and
hat
is
it
so
the
is
him
asking
the
question
and
standing
there
like
this
because
in
fact
you
see
in
one
of
them
just
about
ready
to
open
my
mouth
but
he
let
me
respond
that
is
almost
false
advertising
it
you
know
so
mentioned
it
is
disaster
mean
is
controlled
by
her
money
so
is
so
is
by
the
way
the
only
one
my
campaign
you
know
one
of
the
things
that
makes
me
happy
heard
one
of
my
commentators
this
morning
said
you
know
been
watching
this
stuff
for
years
and
never
seen
anything
like
what
has
happened
with
trump
one
of
them
actually
said
one
of
them
special
special
like
you
special
that
nice
very
every
once
in
while
somebody
can
say
something
that
hits
you
where
are
you
who
said
that
wow
so
nice
thank
you
that
is
nice
one
like
you
know
very
once
in
while
there
is
statement
that
is
either
nice
or
brutal
think
was
brutal
statement
right
can
be
applied
to
just
like
to
use
the
same
thing
twice
on
one
of
my
enemies
right
because
consider
them
enemies
we
view
this
as
war
we
view
this
as
war
war
war
and
so
you
like
to
use
it
hate
to
give
it
up
what
how
are
you
going
to
help
my
little
girl
daughter
oh
we
are
going
to
help
your
daughter
we
are
going
to
help
the
country
called
helping
the
daughter
we
are
going
to
help
your
country
so
here
is
the
story
so
we
are
in
situation
where
we
have
incompetent
leadership
where
our
trade
deals
are
killing
us
our
military
is
not
prepared
general
when
he
left
just
recently
he
said
that
we
are
less
prepared
than
at
any
time
that
he
can
remember
and
think
he
went
back
tot
he
beginning
but
say
second
world
war
ok
enough
and
we
should
be
very
prepared
now
because
the
world
hates
us
she
has
done
terrible
job
as
secretary
of
state
think
of
it
comes
out
he
said
trump
is
brilliant
he
is
doing
an
amazing
job
and
he
is
leading
the
pack
ok
nice
and
she
and
my
opponents
oh
it
terrible
that
said
it
be
nice
if
we
could
get
along
with
the
world
it
be
seriously
no
no
it
be
nice
mean
they
want
me
to
refute
his
statement
how
dare
you
say
brilliant
how
dare
going
to
do
that
and
by
the
way
if
he
said
it
about
anyone
of
them
they
would
have
been
very
happy
but
the
point
is
we
have
to
get
along
the
world
has
blown
up
around
now
know
if
you
saw
his
recent
release
they
were
talking
about
the
department
of
state
state
department
and
they
said
very
strongly
you
know
the
things
that
done
well
they
find
it
because
what
have
they
done
good
and
they
said
bringing
peace
to
syria
did
you
see
that
so
instead
of
saying
they
made
mistake
call
it
they
made
mistake
trying
to
justify
it
well
we
meant
working
on
it
can
you
believe
bringing
peace
to
syria
the
world
is
blowing
up
the
migration
in
syria
they
say
one
of
their
achievements
for
the
year
is
bringing
peace
to
syria
and
the
whole
talking
about
it
the
level
of
stupidity
is
incredible
telling
you
used
to
use
the
word
incompetent
now
just
call
them
stupid
went
to
an
ivy
league
school
very
highly
educated
know
words
had
the
best
words
have
but
no
better
word
than
stupid
right
there
is
none
there
is
none
no
no
no
word
like
that
so
we
are
going
to
turn
things
around
but
and
if
we
have
got
to
tell
you
just
saw
where
for
the
last
week
been
hitting
me
really
hard
with
the
women
card
ok
really
hard
and
had
to
say
ok
enough
enough
and
we
did
strong
number
not
going
to
win
any
by
the
way
love
the
concept
love
love
love
having
woman
president
be
her
horrible
horrible
and
you
know
really
tell
you
who
does
not
like
yeah
get
good
do
but
tell
you
who
like
are
women
women
like
see
it
all
the
time
and
always
so
theatrical
trump
said
this
and
that
and
this
and
you
just
actually
do
it
just
have
to
turn
off
the
television
so
many
times
she
just
gives
me
headache
but
you
know
although
think
last
night
gave
her
big
headache
can
imagine
can
imagine
those
discussions
but
you
have
to
hit
back
hard
and
you
let
them
push
you
around
and
today
she
gave
and
she
never
even
mentioned
my
name
you
know
in
the
debate
was
mentioned
nine
times
mean
everything
all
of
them
but
her
was
mentioned
nine
times
none
of
the
other
candidates
were
mentioned
and
then
she
came
out
with
the
sexism
which
is
so
nonsense
and
but
playing
that
card
and
then
had
to
hit
her
back
so
hit
her
back
and
talked
about
her
husband
and
the
abuse
of
women
and
the
tremendous
abuse
no
tremendous
abuse
mean
you
look
at
it
tremendous
abuse
and
talked
about
that
and
now
today
the
television
is
going
crazy
and
she
gets
up
makes
and
even
mention
anything
about
me
with
sexism
or
anything
else
wonder
why
wonder
why
and
remember
this
really
important
poll
just
came
out
where
tied
another
one
came
out
couple
of
weeks
ago
fox
where
leading
by
four
or
five
points
against
her
individually
doing
great
even
focused
on
her
yet
look
at
the
people
focused
on
want
to
really
knock
them
want
to
mention
their
names
but
you
know
of
those
people
that
are
all
gone
they
were
all
people
that
attacked
me
it
be
nice
if
our
country
could
have
that
same
thing
you
attack
and
boom
gone
and
if
we
could
do
it
verbally
you
know
if
we
could
do
it
verbally
even
better
right
you
know
who
wants
to
use
our
military
by
the
way
we
are
going
to
build
the
strongest
the
best
the
most
powerful
military
ever
ever
ever
and
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
and
it
will
cost
you
much
less
money
and
it
will
be
great
mean
you
are
signing
in
programs
things
that
you
will
never
ever
use
you
know
that
and
you
are
paying
for
it
and
you
will
never
ever
use
them
so
we
will
get
that
straightened
out
we
are
going
to
straighten
lot
of
things
we
are
going
to
straighten
out
common
core
common
core
is
dead
going
to
be
dead
when
look
at
parents
and
see
local
parents
in
and
new
and
south
went
to
school
and
saw
the
parents
they
love
their
children
they
want
that
they
want
education
they
love
they
care
about
money
they
care
about
anything
they
love
their
children
and
local
and
they
get
together
and
they
do
wonderful
programs
they
are
smart
people
as
opposed
to
getting
it
done
by
bureaucrats
that
are
getting
big
fat
checks
in
washington
mean
we
have
such
talent
in
this
country
and
we
use
it
so
dead
common
core
gone
we
are
going
to
get
rid
of
it
department
of
education
we
are
going
to
get
rid
of
it
we
are
bringing
education
to
local
level
one
thing
on
education
so
in
the
world
we
are
ranked
number
there
are
third
world
countries
that
are
ranked
better
than
us
in
education
and
many
other
things
and
yet
per
pupil
we
are
number
by
far
there
is
nobody
close
number
two
even
close
so
we
spend
more
money
for
pupil
than
any
country
in
the
world
and
we
are
ranked
number
which
is
way
down
at
the
bottom
essentially
mean
can
you
imagine
we
are
ranked
number
and
we
are
number
and
what
do
like
saying
about
my
campaign
spent
less
money
than
anybody
else
and
have
the
best
results
number
one
by
lot
and
spent
no
money
mean
my
plane
cost
me
some
money
but
spent
no
took
little
radio
in
but
do
that
took
think
the
station
is
so
lovely
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
but
spent
essentially
no
money
and
then
you
have
all
these
other
guys
spending
vast
and
they
like
the
way
the
united
states
is
run
now
why
would
we
put
guy
like
like
some
of
the
others
not
only
bush
they
spend
money
see
on
the
all
day
long
you
know
the
black
background
got
like
black
thing
he
should
have
put
something
like
that
behind
him
right
right
there
the
flag
no
no
and
like
him
think
he
is
nice
guy
but
see
these
with
the
backdrop
and
it
is
just
not
think
good
so
think
of
it
spent
no
money
and
number
one
others
spent
they
will
have
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
and
they
are
not
even
in
the
race
what
we
need
for
our
country
what
got
know
what
the
hell
he
means
by
that
but
ok
so
but
think
fan
think
are
you
protester
no
no
body
likes
trump
not
protester
love
you
you
know
the
only
time
worry
about
it
the
only
time
the
cameras
focus
on
the
crowd
is
when
we
have
protester
cause
always
have
like
look
at
this
room
packed
always
have
the
biggest
crowds
and
go
home
and
my
wife
said
were
there
many
people
watched
you
on
television
tonight
said
had
people
she
said
they
show
it
they
have
it
right
on
your
face
so
have
people
have
in
oklahoma
in
mobile
alabama
nobody
knows
because
those
cameras
stay
right
in
your
face
and
think
they
move
you
know
think
they
might
be
fixed
because
modern
cameras
maybe
except
every
time
there
is
guy
that
stands
up
protesting
you
know
they
are
on
drugs
or
something
cause
some
of
those
guys
like
they
even
know
what
the
hell
they
are
doing
there
all
the
sudden
the
cameras
swerve
and
make
perfect
shots
and
like
it
because
then
it
shows
how
big
the
crowds
are
so
you
know
some
time
think
going
to
put
in
some
false
protesters
put
in
some
friendly
protesters
the
only
way
going
to
be
able
to
get
the
crowd
in
so
when
we
started
talked
about
trade
talked
about
the
border
talked
about
lot
of
things
and
started
on
june
and
in
trump
tower
the
famous
escalator
ride
and
it
takes
guts
to
run
for
president
tell
you
you
know
like
never
did
this
before
and
you
know
then
they
tell
you
on
debate
we
had
the
largest
debate
we
have
the
largest
audience
in
the
history
of
cable
television
then
couple
of
weeks
later
had
million
fox
had
million
had
million
the
largest
audience
in
the
history
of
now
there
the
cameras
are
on
live
right
now
mean
you
know
so
the
largest
audience
in
the
history
of
inaudible
now
the
debates
used
to
be
if
you
go
back
four
years
or
eight
years
you
know
whenever
the
cycles
came
up
nobody
even
wanted
they
want
the
debates
think
they
were
forced
to
take
them
for
licensing
nobody
wanted
the
debates
they
drew
nothing
but
now
drawing
million
now
they
want
to
have
more
debates
oh
can
we
have
more
can
we
have
more
can
they
go
three
hours
do
you
remember
when
they
had
the
one
go
three
hours
said
no
not
doing
three
hours
too
long
who
wants
could
stand
up
here
for
hours
but
who
the
hell
wants
to
sit
home
watching
three
hours
of
the
stuff
right
trump
you
have
seconds
what
would
you
do
about
isis
oh

and
by
the
way
that
question

questions
you
know
why
because
want
to
be
unpredictable
want
to
tell
isis
what
going
to
do
to
knock
the
hell
out
of
them

what
four
years
been
watching
mean
four
years

because
going

taking
over

we
made
deal
for
iran
done
by
some
of
the
dumbest
people
on
earth
on
our
side
we
gave
them
everything
they
we
even
get
our
prisoners
back
and
now
iran
wants
to
start
negotiating
separately
for
them
can
you
believe
it
go
crazy
we
would
have
gotten
them
back
all
you
had
to
do
was
say
we
want
our
prisoners
back
they
would
have
said
no
would
have
said
want
them
back
you
understand
me
want
them
back
they
would
have
said
no
we
do
that
would
have
said
and
would
have
left
then
would
have
doubled
up
the
sanctions
and
guarantee
you
guarantee
you
that
within
hours
they
would
have
called
back
and
say
got
your
prisoners
can
we
talk
and
would
have
never
given
them
billion
would
have
never
given
them
the
money
would
have
never
give
using
it
they
have
to
make
nuclear
they
can
buy
it
why
are
they
going
to
make
it
then
we
have
the
nuclear
where
they
have
inspections
how
about
the
area
you
know
the
big
area
they
want
us
there
oh
wonder
why
they
want
us
there
so
they
ok
then
they
have
the
inspection
but
the
is
the
beauty
we
think
making
nuclear
weapons
here
well
let
us
go
check
president
check
no
sir
not
making
nuclear
weapons
nobody
no
not
we
would
never
do
thing
like
that
these
are
people
that
have
deceived
us
lied
to
us
terrorist
state
but
and
used
to
say
the
worst
deal
that
ever
seen
negotiated
and
by
the
way
just
to
finish
prisoners
so
come
back
we
get
our
prisoners
but
then
when
hear
the
other
day
that
now
this
deal
is
done
all
done
and
now
hear
they
want
to
negotiate
to
get
and
what
do
they
say
they
said
very
strongly
they
said
we
are
going
to
want
lot
for
the
prisoners
out
starting
off
going
to
want
lot
now
already
taken
off
the
sanctions
already
rich
as
hell
what
going
on
there
why
say
mean
some
people
say
worst
than
stupidity
something
going
on
that
we
know
about
mean
honest
and
you
almost
think
not
saying
that
and
not
conspiracy
person
as
you
said
we
are
saying
it
half
the
people
in
this
room
are
saying
it
trying
to
be
you
know
just
hoping
just
stupid
people
ok
which
they
are
or
something
going
on
because
inconceivable
you
know
do
you
ever
see
where
some
things
are
so
bad
that
it
be
that
nobody
can
do
what
they
did
right
nobody
so
iran
now
wants
to
negotiate
separately
for
the
inaudible
in
other
words
that
deal
is
done
now
we
want
to
start
all
over
again
and
they
want
lot
we
want
lot
and
just
want
to
just
shoot
the
television
you
know
because
they
would
have
had
it
just
by
saying
and
you
know
when
they
asked
and
the
deal
was
made
everybody
knows
horrible
deal
going
to
need
to
going
to
lead
to
tremendous
nuclear
proliferation
and
so
rich
now
you
know
they
became
billion
they
became
so
rich
and
many
other
things
that
you
even
know
about
most
people
even
know
what
the
agreement
says
but
tell
you
what
when
you
look
at
what
doing
not
going
to
have
if
we
keep
going
like
this
folks
not
going
to
have
country
left
not
going
to
have
country
not
going
to
have
country
and
like
dumping
ground
for
the
world
dumping
ground
they
want
to
take
these
migrants
the
migrants
you
know
and
feel
terrible
about
the
migration
caused
by
and
the
ones
that
caused
it
they
go
into
libya
they
knocked
the
hell
out
of
ok
so
they
backed
rebels
who
end
up
killing
the
ambassador
and
the
other
young
people
you
know
the
ambassador
was
riding
in
jeep
one
of
our
jeeps
of
course
military
jeep
holding
the
libyan
flag
and
you
know
freedom
freedom
freedom
and
then
gets
killed
by
the
same
people
so
we
backed
people
that
turned
out
to
be
far
worse
than
look
at
what
we
did
in
iraq
look
at
what
we
did
in
iraq
mean
what
the
hell
did
we
get
we
spent
trillion
and
that
was
as
year
and
half
ago
keep
saying
two
or
three
lot
more
than
that
we
spent
trillion
we
have
thousands
of
deaths
and
not
even
talking
other
side
you
are
talking
about
hundreds
of
thousands
maybe
millions
you
have
thousands
of
deaths
we
have
wounded
warriors
who
love
all
of
these
guys
are
the
toughest
these
are
the
greatest
people
you
know
these
are
the
greatest
people
and
then
what
happens
we
leave
and
we
have
president
that
announces
the
date
of
when
we
are
leaving
so
said
man
if
the
enemy
just
going
to
go
wait
for
months
right
he
gave
date
we
are
leaving
iraq
we
will
be
gone
by
such
and
such
time
said
just
sitting
there
watching
and
saying
man
really
stupid
because
believe
me
the
enemy
want
to
be
killed
you
know
you
hear
so
much
oh
they
want
to
go
with
the
virgins
up
to
wherever
they
go
right
they
they
want
to
live
and
they
want
to
take
care
of
their
families
always
their
families
you
remember
that
because
their
families
know
going
on
ok
you
think
their
wives
know
what
they
are
planning
you
think
their
kids
know
exactly
what
daddy
is
doing
when
daddy
is
going
to
fly
into
the
world
trade
you
think
they
know
they
know
exactly
going
on
remember
that
and
frankly
think
they
have
more
love
for
their
lives
than
they
do
for
their
own
lives
ok
but
they
still
want
to
live
so
here
is
gives
an
exact
date
he
gives
an
exact
date
and
so
they
pull
back
and
everyone
says
oh
we
are
doing
so
well
look
doing
so
well
why
should
they
fight
when
they
know
in
months
they
can
go
in
and
take
the
place
so
what
happens
so
we
have
isis
taking
lot
of
oil
said
take
the
oil
remember
when
we
left
was
opposed
to
going
in
because
said
going
to
the
middle
east
because
you
had
iraq
and
you
had
iran
and
said
they
fight
always
fighting
for
decades
and
decades
for
generations
they
fight
what
they
do
they
fight
how
we
ever
got
involved
in
this
mess
is
hard
to
believe
they
fight
and
they
were
equal
militarily
they
go
this
way
feet
they
go
this
way
feet
then
they
rest
couple
of
years
then
they
start
fighting
again
then
throws
little
gas
everyone
goes
crazy
oh
because
of
gas
they
go
back
and
forth
the
same
and
they
were
and
said
if
you
go
after
one
or
the
other
in
this
case
iraq
going
to
the
middle
east
what
going
to
happen
going
to
the
middle
east
and
exactly
what
happened
we
totally
the
middle
east
we
have
now
migrations
largely
because
of
happened
afterwards
you
know
iraq
was
horrible
it
was
stupid
to
go
in
and
we
should
have
never
gone
in
but
we
have
gotten
out
the
way
we
went
out
and
we
have
given
dates
mean
would
have
probably
said
we
are
going
to
stay
forever
and
they
would
have
said
oh
man
and
then
keep
going
keep
going
and
eventually
they
would
get
tired
and
say
this
guy
is
crazy
mean
never
going
to
leave
and
make
deal
but
when
you
announce
you
are
leaving
in
months
or
whatever
the
hell
he
said
they
just
pull
back
and
then
as
soon
as
we
left
they
come
in
ok
so
they
have
the
oil
you
know
who
the
biggest
benefactor
of
the
oil
is
right
china
always
china
love
china
love
mexico
their
leaders
are
too
smart
for
us
we
have
no
border
we
will
build
wall
mexico
will
pay
for
the
wall
by
the
way
building
wall
we
are
going
to
have
border
and
people
are
going
to
come
into
our
country
but
they
are
going
to
come
in
through
legal
process
not
coming
in
the
way
coming
in
now
just
walking
in
like
nothing
they
are
going
to
come
in
but
they
are
going
to
come
through
legal
process
so
with
iraq
so
we
give
them
the
date
and
they
take
over
we
take
the
year
so
for
four
years
have
been
talking
about
it
then
because
of
paris
all
of
sudden
they
start
bombing
the
oil
but
want
to
just
bomb
the
oil
wanted
to
take
oil
bombing
you
know
we
are
bombing
great
going
to
happen
after
that
so
bombing
and
you
know
we
are
not
really
bombing
it
because
they
are
still
selling
it
said
how
could
they
keep
selling
it
does
not
want
to
hit
them
too
hard
because
he
is
afraid
he
is
going
to
pollute
the
atmosphere
no
this
is
serious
now
think
of
it
he
talks
about
the
carbon
footprint
and
yet
he
will
fly
very
old
air
force
one
an
old
with
the
old
engines
and
you
know
spewing
stuff
so
got
problem
with
the
carbon
footprint
you
use
hair
spray
because
hair
spray
is
going
to
affect
the
ozone
trying
to
figure
out
see
in
my
room
in
new
york
city
and
want
to
put
little
spray
so
that
can
right
right
but
hear
where
they
want
me
to
use
hair
spray
they
want
me
to
use
the
pump
because
the
other
one
which
really
like
better
than
going
bing
bing
bing
and
then
it
comes
out
in
big
right
and
you
stuck
in
your
hair
and
you
say
oh
my
god
got
to
take
shower

but
we
have
to
destroy

have
to
destroy
our

by
the
way
china
abiding
by
anything
buying
all
of
our
coal
we
use
coal
anymore
essentially
buying
our
coal
and
using
it
now
when
you
talk
about
the
planet
so
big
out
there
here
there
like
our
next
door
right
in
terms
of
the
universe
miss
universe
by
the
way
made
great
deal
when
sold
oh
did
get
rich
that
was
great
deal
you
know
they
broke
my
choppers
on
that
they
said
he
talks
about
illegal
immigration
not
going
to
put
him
on
television
first
of
all
is
being
sued
like
crazy
you
believe
it
and
made
great
deal
with
them
just
like
an
amazing
deal
far
more
than
would
have
ever
gotten
mean
made
an
unbelievable
deal
far
more
than
ever
would
have
gotten
if
said
think
going
to
sell
it
if
times
were
normal
right
it
amazing
the
way
that
stuff
can
work
out
but
love
miss
universe
and
love
the
universe
but
think
of
it
so
china
is
spewing
up
all
this
stuff
and
holding
back
and
with
china
you
know
we
signed
these
agreements
where
we
have
to
do
it
now
they
have
to
do
it
within
or
years
think
going
to
be
doing
it
like
japan
if
somebody
attacks
japan
we
have
to
immediately
go
and
start
world
war
ok
if
we
get
attacked
japan
have
to
help
us
somehow
that
sound
so
fair
does
that
sound
good
so
south
korea
order
televisions
order
thousands
of
televisions
year
order
televisions
because
have
lot
of
stuff
and
like
nice
brand
new
all
made
in
south
korea
most
other
than
and
in
all
fairness
has
lost
its
way
but
lot
of
them
all
of
them
mean
all
pretty
much
all
of
them
right
think
just
about
but
order
thousands
of
televisions
all
from
south
korea
so
we
have
people
on
the
border
separating
south
korea
from
this
maniac
in
north
korea
we
get
nothing
what
do
we
get
nothing
making
fortune
an
economic
behemoth
lot
of
you
know
we
protect
germany
germany
how
many
people
have
we
protect
germany
an
economic
behemoth
we
protect
saudi
arabia
they
were
during
the
good
oil
days
now
probably
half
which
is
fine
but
during
the
good
old
they
were
making
billion
listen
to
this
billion
dollars
day
and
we
protect
them
our
military
they
pay
us
peanuts
like
nothing
and
then
if
we
want
to
buy
we
want
to
move
to
another
location
well
very
expensive
if
we
do
that
we
want
they
charge
us
rent
mean
look
we
are
run
by
people
that
are
so
bad
so
out
of
their
league
and
see
it
see
it
on
the
stage
you
know
lot
of
them
are
nice
people
you
know
lot
of
people
think
like
these
people
do
like
them
but
they
have
business
sense
they
have
business
ability
they
have
common
sense
politicians
all
talk
no
action
when
say
folks
when
say
going
to
build
wall
most
of
them
say
you
build
wall
build
wall
in
china
years
ago
they
built
the
great
wall
of
china
which
is
bigger
than
any
wall
thinking
about
ok
the
great
wall
of
china
goes
miles
we
have
miles
of
which
we
only
need
miles
because
you
have
lot
of
natural
barriers
right
that
are
extremely
tough
to
get
across
we
have
miles
so
china
has
or
miles
and
we
have
miles
we
have
modern
cranes
we
have
caterpillar
tractors
want
to
use
caterpillar
want
to
use
made
in
america
even
my
hats
made
in
america
it
easy
to
find
guy
that
could
do
those
hats
you
know
what
talking
about
see
so
many
of
my
hat
right
make
america
great
again
see
these
things
that
are
out
of
plastic
out
of
all
sorts
of
crap
mine
are
made
in
america
and
honestly
they
do
great
job
but
they
produce
as
many
as
like
because
frankly
big
mean
amazing
those
hats
are
amazing
but
wanted
to
have
it
made
and
you
know
why
wanted
it
wanted
it
anyway
but
also
knew
that
as
soon
as
the
hats
came
out
and
other
things
we
have
website
as
soon
as
the
hats
came
out
knew
the
press
would
be
calling
and
true
first
hour
when
the
hats
were
announced
get
call
from
the
new
york
times
trump
where
are
those
hats
made
said
america
knew
it
knew
it
because
as
you
know
if
would
have
said
china
would
have
been
in
big
big
trouble
but
being
knocked
off
all
over
the
world
mean
see
hats
like
helmets
see
them
all
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
but
the
story
got
to
build
wall
so
when
talk
and
when
up
on
the
stage
with
these
guys
these
people
wonderful
people
and
very
nice
woman
nice
woman
when
up
on
the
stage
with
them
they
think
crazy
when
say
mexico
saying
going
to
build
wall
going
to
be
great
wall
going
to
be
real
wall
see
this
ceiling
this
ceiling
is
peanuts
compared
to
the
height
of
the
wall
talking
about
talking
about
van
to
get
up
there
not
coming
down
because
too
dangerous
all
right
did
you
ever
see
what
they
do
now
we
have
these
little
walls
they
build
ramps
they
build
ramp
say
it
be
cheaper
just
to
knock
the
wall
down
and
just
and
then
they
drive
over
it
with
jeeps
loaded
up
with
drugs
do
you
see
this
they
build
ramps
there
was
picture
in
time
magazine
ramp
little
ramp
that
goes
over
the
wall
so
they
have
jeep
over
down
bump
make
money
we
get
the
drugs
think
of
it
we
build
wall
is
right
got
to
build
wall
we
get
the
drugs
they
get
the
cash
no
so
good
right
we
like
that
deal
our
politicians
know
they
know
so
when
say
going
to
pay
for
it
these
guys
on
the
stage
with
me
not
business
people
they
understand
mexico
makes
fortune
off
the
united
states
number
one
we
give
them
lot
of
money
but
in
addition
to
that
taking
our
businesses
making
you
talk
about
trade
deficit
tell
you
what
mexico
in
certain
way
is
in
the
new
china
mexico
is
making
an
absolute
fortune
peanuts
compared
to
the
cost
of
the
wall
say
the
cost
of
the
wall
is
billion
good
can
do
great
job
at
billion
think
have
lot
of
money
left
over
somebody
else
would
and
by
the
way
years
ago
they
wanted
to
build
wall
people
that
are
opposed
to
it
now
they
wanted
to
stop
and
they
wanted
to
build
wall
you
know
one
of
the
reasons
they
build
the
wall
because
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
they
get
an
environmental
impact
study
approved
can
you
believe
it
because
there
was
toad
or
turtle
or
snake
or
something
was
in
the
way
now
think
of
it
in
china
in
the
south
china
sea
there
were
these
land
masses
that
were
covered
by
water
but
pretty
close
to
the
top
china
sends
in
massive
excavators
and
inaudible
building
military
fortresses
in
the
south
china
sea
and
friend
of
mine
who
is
one
of
the
biggest
and
richest
people
in
china
great
guy
great
people
fine
just
too
smart
mean
the
leaders
are
too
smart
for
our
people
they
be
too
smart
when
put
my
people
there
when
they
call
up
like
to
speak
to
the
donor
that
is
negotiating
it
no
no
the
donor
now
is
going
to
speak
to
you
know
great
businessman
you
have
so
many
people
they
call
all
these
business
people
call
so
friend
of
mine
so
call
him
say
actually
doing
that
and
then
jokingly
said
how
long
did
it
take
to
get
started
did
you
have
to
get
an
environmental
impact
study
approved
in
order
to
excavate
he
looked
at
me
goes
hope
kidding
when
you
say
that
they
conceived
of
the
idea
and
they
started
digging
four
hours
later
ok
there
is
no
you
know
go
through
years
of
environmental
impact
you
are
going
to
hurt
the
snail
going
to
hurt
this
you
are
going
to
they
are
doing
big
thing
they
excavated
massive
massive
take
look
massive
the
biggest
excavation
they
are
ripping
the
hell
out
of
that
ocean
they
are
ripping
it
and
they
are
taking
their
dirt
and
they
are
putting
it
and
building
air
fields
and
building
forts
we
do
it
because
just
like
said
for
the
law
legitimately
they
could
not
get
an
environmental
impact
statement
now
probably
not
the
only
reason
it
happen
heard
their
costs
were
too
high
with
me
easy
you
know
doing
the
old
post
office
or
watch
you
under
budget
ahead
of
schedule
hey
look
at
the
campaign
the
at
million
and
down
at
the
bottom
nothing
and
at
the
top
the
same
thing
actually
said
funny
the
other
day
got
this
great
review
they
said
trump
is
great
speaker
the
crowd
is
spellbound
but
he
has
one
problem
and
reading
and
want
to
see
the
problem
is
he
speaks
through
the
applause
in
other
words
like
say
that
you
applaud
start
talking
you
finish
your
applause
and
you
know
why
because
so
excited
because
we
have
so
much
potential
true
want
to
wait
for
your
applause
we
have
have
so
many
we
have
so
much
potential
there
are
so
many
things
to
do
really
sort
of
want
to
wait
want
to
do
it
and
just
noticed
did
it
again
you
were
getting
ready
to
give
big
applause
because
you
like
that
and
speaking
killed
the
applause
but
he
is
right
but
except
not
speaker
what
am
is
doer
get
things
done
so
when
the
people
up
on
the
stage
with
me
and
have
clue
by
the
way
you
talk
about
low
energy
she
has
lower
energy
than
bush
which
is
hard
to
believe
she
does
and
tell
you
and
been
saying
it
and
maybe
rude
maybe
it
is
not
but
it
matter
we
have
much
bigger
problem
we
have
to
save
our
country
so
if
rude
and
if
people
think
rude
actually
nice
person
have
big
heart
want
to
help
people
want
to
help
the
migration
want
to
do
safe
zone
in
syria
want
them
coming
here
we
know
who
these
people
are
they
are
undocumented
and
we
should
do
safe
zone
over
there
we
should
have
the
gulf
states
saudi
arabia
and
these
states
they
are
not
spending
they
have
got
to
spend
they
have
to
pay
you
know
we
are
protecting
them
doing
they
be
there
for
two
minutes
if
we
protecting
them
they
have
to
start
paying
they
are
not
taking
anybody
ok
how
about
germany
taking
millions
of
migrants
can
you
believe
what
she
is
doing
to
that
country
and
she
was
the
person
of
the
year
and
everybody
said
trump
was
supposed
to
booing
hey
what
are
you
going
to
do
think
she
has
made
terrible
mistake
we
will
find
out
time
will
tell
they
have
tremendous
crime
problems
think
she
has
made
tremendous
mistake
but
what
like
is
in
syria
with
other
money
meaning
the
gulf
states
and
others
and
germany
and
others
because
look
germany
is
paying
fortune
to
accept
all
these
people
give
us
the
money
we
do
massive
safe
zone
and
then
eventually
when
this
whole
catastrophe
straightens
out
which
will
probably
be
able
to
get
it
straightened
out
understand
this
now
but
once
straightened
out
they
could
go
home
to
their
country
you
know
to
their
area
it
is
interesting
have
thousands
of
people
that
work
for
me
thousands
and
have
people
that
come
from
far
they
are
all
here
legally
worry
about
it
use
verify
but
have
people
oh
they
go
and
check
these
guys
go
check
they
went
into
the
old
post
office
checking
everybody
who
walked
their
dog
are
you
hear
illegally
they
said
they
found
one
person
out
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
believe
it
but
you
know
it
is
possible
somebody
slipped
hey
we
do
have
million
people
in
the
country
and
it
is
probably
much
higher
number
than
that
ok
it
is
probably
much
higher
number
but
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
and
we
are
going
to
so
just
want
to
finish
by
saying
this
look
we
have
situation
that
is
out
of
control
our
country
is
dumping
ground
for
the
rest
of
the
world
we
are
laughed
at
by
the
rest
of
the
world
and
when
started
this
journey
and
it
is
journey
and
do
love
you
people
amazing
people
and
by
the
way
you
are
so
smart
lot
of
times
they
will
say
well
people
are
love
by
that
but
they
are
not
we
have
and
we
have
executives
and
we
have
young
people
they
say
the
audience
is
old
not
older
the
audience
is
young
the
other
night
in
told
that
and
said
we
have
so
many
young
people
and
the
place
erupted
they
are
all
young
people
we
have
an
amazing
thing
happening
just
look
their
way
of
not

said
totally
changed
the
landscape
of
politics
forever
going
to
be
different
your
campaign
never
been
anything
like
it
ok
he
was
very
nice
said
you
understand
you
understand
if
win
will
consider
this
and
mean
this
total
and
complete
waste
of
time
really
do
so
because
not
going
to
do
anything
wonderful
oh
good
had
nice
crowds
write
about
me
every
once
in
while
every
two
years
have
story
trump
ran
this
rather
good
campaign
if
we
win
to
me
and
honestly
you
should
feel
the
same
thing
if
we
win
terrible
waste
of
time
because
have
somebody
else
in
there
they
be
able
to
do
what
do
not
going
to
be
able
to
and
even
if
you
get
one
of
these
republicans
in
like
finish
the
so
the
wall
when
say
mexico
is
going
to
pay
they
all
laugh
they
all
go
they
think
funny
honestly
these
are
people
they
think
funny
laughing
you
know
lightly
like
oh
ho
so
funny
ha
ha
ha
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
folks
making
billions
and
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
on
deficits
that
we
have
with
mexico
the
wall
is
peanuts
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
but
mention
it
now
they
laugh
because
starting
to
agree
with
me
and
then
the
other
day
one
of
the
people
said
it
was
ted
who
is
nice
guy
but
he
said
going
to
build
wall
at
the
southern
border
said
look
and
my
wife
is
sitting
inaudible
where
did
that
come
from
right
no
good
guy
but
he
said
on
one
of
think
it
was
on
fox
he
was
being
interviewed
and
he
said
going
to
build
wall
at
the
southern
border
he
say
mexico
was
going
to
pay
was
going
to
pay
he
gone
that
far
yet
but
believe
me
going
to
happen
see
all
trying
to
catch
up
with
me
because
when
did
this
stuff
it
was
very
out
there
now
the
one
that
everybody
wants
to
sort
of
aspire
to
but
what
happens
is
so
up
and
talking
and
you
know
routinely
going
to
have
the
border
going
to
have
this
and
that
and
going
to
build
wall
my
wife
is
sitting
there
she
says
darling
did
you
hear
that
he
just
said
going
to
build
wall
the
first
time
you
know
what
you
say
she
heard
that
from
any
other
candidate
ok
so
going
to
build
wall
mexico
is
going
to
pay
for
it
there
are
so
many
things
going
to
do
but
when
when
started
the
journey
it
was
amazing
came
down
it
took
courage
went
down
in
to
the
lobby
of
trump
tower
on
the
escalator
with
have
never
seen
it
looked
like
the
academy
awards
the
press
we
have
lot
of
press
here
today
all
live
look
at
all
those
live
cameras
so
when
came
down
when
came
down
on
the
escalator
we
came
down
and
said
going
to
do
things
and
mentioned
illegal
immigration
you
even
be
talking
about
illegal
it
even
on
the
radar
nobody
was
talking
about
illegal
immigration
is
that
right
now
one
of
the
big
subjects
and
why
and
one
of
the
beautiful
polls
that
came
out
and
so
proud
of
it
just
came
out
with
poll
couple
of
guess
week
ago
percent
for
trump
second
is
third
is
then
so
way
down
but
on
the
economy
they
give
me
percent
with
people
at
the
time
on
the
budget
mean
understand
the
budget
the
economy
win
win
it
hands
down
all
right
but
listen
to
this
on
illegal
immigration
almost
at
percent
and
on
isis
likewise
almost
at
percent
so
people
want
to
be
protected
they
want
to
feel
safe
they
need
strength
they
need
toughness
they
need
smarts
want
to
be
tough
you
know
know
lot
of
tough
guys
but
not
smart
and
the
the
easiest
you
can
be
tough
got
to
be
smart
start
smart
first
got
to
be
got
to
be
tough
because
the
world
is
trying
to
take
advantage
of
us
so
what
happens
is
this
came
out
started
did
it
was
oh
that
first
couple
of
weeks
with
illegal
immigration
and
mexico
and
all
of
this
stuff
then
was
killed
in
san
and
was
killed
in
shaw
an
unbelievable
young
man
was
killed
just
shot
right
through
the
head
by
an
illegal
immigrant
was
shot
by
guy
who
came
in
five
or
six
times
shot
in
the
back
so
many
great
people
and
these
are
two
so
many
and
then
you
have
the
economy
and
the
jobs
that
are
being
lost
and
people
paying
taxes
and
all
of
this
stuff
right
and
all
of
sudden
people
are
coming
over
and
say
the
wall
and
now
starting
to
say
the
wall
we
have
to
be
progressive
in
our
thinking
when
say
progressive
mean
like
smart
not
talking
progressive
like
would
say
the
guy
want
to
tax
you
think
of
it
think
of
it
this
guy
wants
to
raise
your
taxes
to
percent
no
no
think
have
to
move
out
of
this
love
this
area
by
the
way
been
here
many
times
great
golfing
area
right
we
love
it
no
more
golf
if
no
more
golf
no
no
you
have
any
golf
anymore
there
be
you
have
any
money
left
to
be
be
paying
it
in
taxes
this
guy
is
total
disaster
and
not
saying
that
tell
you
why
you
know
said
well
like
to
run
against
trump
believe
me
this
poor
chuck
meet
the
press
his
show
is
dying
and
he
keeps
saying
do
it
do
it
but
never
liked
it
you
know
just
he
never
treated
me
fairly
so
do
his
show
he
gets
the
highest
ratings
had
in
years
he
went
from
like
believe
me
even
give
you
the
numbers
they
were
massive
the
numbers
right
saved
his
life
and
then
he
goes
said
that
she
would
most
like
to
run
against
trump
and
yes
and
looking
forward
to
it
trust
me
the
last
person
already
gotten
dose
last
night
do
you
agree
she
had
tough
night
she
had
tough
one
she
had
tough
night
looking
at
the
beauty
pageant
ok
so
said
and
chuck
and
nice
guy
not
trying
to
knock
him
please
be
insulted
chuck
but
she
says
she
like
him
but
he
treat
me
right
so
he
goes
the
campaign
said
most
like
to
run
against
trump
like
some
kind
of
sap
so
call
him
and
say
chuck
let
me
explain
something
when
they
say
they
want
to
run
against
me
that
means
they
want
to
run
against
me
do
you
understand
that
do
you
understand
reverse
psychology
they
say
they
want
to
run
against
me
first
of
all
winning
and
tied
in
the
polls
now
and
even
hit
her
yet
but
look
at
what
happened
to
all
the
guys
hit
gone
or
failing
badly
ok
and
be
gone
soon
but
think
of
it
say
so
chuck
report
it
like
properly
trust
me
they
want
to
run
against
trump
the
last
thing
she
wants
in
her
whole
life
is
this
was
only
did
this
in
like
minutes
what
happened
to
them
because
the
husband
wants
to
come
and
she
wants
to
accuse
me
of
things
and
the
one
of
the
great
abusers
of
the
world
give
me
break
give
me
break
give
me
break
so
the
last
person
she
wants
to
run
against
is
me
now
the
story
look
the
story
very
simple
so
announced
and
was
talking
about
trade
was
talking
about
the
wall
was
talking
about
the
borders
was
talking
about
was
talking
about
the
amendment
will
be
saved
by
the
way
the
amendment
it
will
be
saved
the
amendment
is
going
to
be
with
us
if
president
you
know
doing
everything
they
want
to
get
rid
of
the
bullets
now
doing
everything
they
can
think
of
paris
think
of
think
if
you
had
some
guns
in
paris
on
the
good
side
right
they
had
no
guns
paris
has
the
toughest
guns
in
the
world
folks
and
france
mean
you
get
caught
with
gun
the
only
one
that
has
guns
are
the
bad
guys
so
they
go
in
these
various
places
they
called
the
guy
the
mastermind
moron
mean
this
guy
was
moron
call
him
the
guy
with
the
dirty
hat
right
they
got
him
so
good
by
the
way
the
french
police
did
great
job
and
our
police
did
phenomenal
job
they
did
great
job
it
be
wonderful
if
see
this
guy
right
here
in
front
of
me
tough
guy
this
guy
with
the
hat
with
the
lousy
head
of
hair
but
guy
right
here
this
guy
right
there
see
and
that
one
it
be
nice
if
they
had
gun
on
their
waist
somebody
him
him
him
so
that
when
they
you
know
what
they
were
doing
in
paris
get
over
here
boom
get
over
here
boom
your
turn
get
over
here
boom
one
hundred
and
thirty
people
with
more
to
follow
because
there
are
people
that
are
so
badly
injured
right
now
in
hospitals
other
people
are
going
to
die
same
thing
over
there
these
are
people
that
gave
party
in
of
their
marriage
something
going
on
folks
wrong
they
gave
them
party
they
worked
they
gave
them
party
she
came
in
on
fiance
permit
or
some
nonsense
and
she
was
and
he
was
probably
by
her
or
he
was
already
and
people
knew
that
they
were
and
people
in
the
area
knew
that
they
had
bombs
who
the
hell
know
their
next
door
and
they
want
to
talk
about
it
got
to
report
these
people
got
real
problem
got
to
report
them
no
more
nonsense
they
report
them
and
the
reason
they
is
because
they
disagree
with
them
so
much
ok
believe
me
not
because
they
were
afraid
you
saw
the
one
who
politically
correct
to
report
them
they
want
to
report
them
mean
give
me
break
so
we
have
to
change
so
it
started
off
with
me
where
was
going
to
talk
about
trade
was
going
to
talk
about
all
the
things
was
going
to
talk
about
the
military
building
it
up
was
going
to
do
all
of
this
but
after
paris
and
california
and
there
will
be
others
because
they
have
no
fear
of
us
but
after
paris
and
california
it
has
totally
changed
and
my
poll
numbers
went
up
points
amazing
they
went
up
points
said
what
you
think
it
was
the
debate
because
did
good
in
the
debate
they
said
no
people
view
you
as
tough
not
going
to
take
this
crap
what
it
is
and
now
talk
about
protection
talk
about
trust
me
the
trade
so
easy
for
me
got
the
greatest
guys
in
the
world
going
to
come
in
going
to
do
great
job
going
to
do
some
myself
always
talk
about
ford
going
to
built
plant
billion
in
mexico
not
going
to
happen
with
me
that
stuff
is
those
deals
are
no
good
leaving
closing
plants
all
over
michigan
to
build
plant
in
in
mexico
how
the
hell
does
that
help
us
who
are
the
people
that
think
this
is
good
thing
for
us
and
in
the
meantime
in
michigan
and
other
places
we
have
plants
closing
all
over
the
place
and
spending
think
about
billion
then
going
to
sell
cars
trucks
and
parts
into
the
united
states
no
tax
no
nothing
say
you
have
to
pay
tax
folks
and
you
know
what
ford
will
say
if
inaudible
pay
tax
going
to
stay
in
the
united
states
mean
very
simple
very
simple
how
about
two
weeks
ago
announced
big
chicago
they
announced
going
to
leave
chicago
with
one
of
their
big
plants
and
going
to
move
it
to
mexico
my
statement
not
eating
anymore
right
no
more
but
want
this
not
going
to
happen
then
make
going
to
make
product
and
going
to
sell
it
into
the
united
states
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
and
by
the
way
free
trader
believe
got
to
be
smart
mean
got
to
get
something
we
get
anything
out
of
anything
we
get
anything
we
lose
on
everything
that
iran
deal
was
disaster
by
the
way
think
of
the
iran
deal
for
one
second
always
and
this
came
to
me
two
weeks
ago
know
why
think
of
it
sooner
very
disappointed
with
myself
the
iran
deal
is
the
worst
deal
ever
seen
negotiated
ok
wrong
you
know
what
the
worst
deal
is
part
of
that
one
too
we
gave
them
iraq
even
better
think
of
it
we
gave
iran
iraq
iran
has
the
biggest
think
of
it
going
to
have
the
richest
oil
if
you
go
to
iraq
take
look
among
the
largest
oil
reserves
in
the
world
we
gave
them
by
decapitating
iraq
and
then
leaving
because
frankly
once
we
did
it
we
should
have
kept
troops
or
something
we
give
iraq
so
not
only
did
they
make
great
deal
in
terms
of
the
iran
deal
that
we
know
having
to
do
with
nuclear
we
also
gave
them
iraq
we
gave
them
iraq
that
been
after
for
years
we
handed
it
to
them
so
now
they
have
the
largest
oil
reserves
among
in
the
world
even
better
than
the
original
deal
mean
whoever
is
representing
iran
is
doing
hell
of
job
ok
if
that
was
stock
got
to
buy
some
so
we
are
not
going
to
have
deals
like
that
with
me
not
going
to
happen
going
to
become
rich
again
we
are
going
to
become
safe
again
and
we
are
going
to
become
strong
again
and
and
going
to
remember
this
moment
this
is
going
to
be
an
important
moment
for
all
of
us
the
one
thing
have
to
say

have
to
ask

the
second

we
are

to
protect
our
second
amendment
totally
common
core

we
are
getting
rid
of
common
core
we
education
to
local
level
the
people
in
this
community
every
time
see
them
they
want
education
locally
the
parents
the
teachers
they
want
to
do
it
they
do
want
bureaucrats
in
washington
telling
them
how
to
educate
their
children
we
spend
as
nation
more
for
education
per
pupil
than
any
other
nation
in
the
world
not
even
close
more
per
pupil
second
place
does
even
exist
it
so
different
and
yet
out
of
countries
we
ranked
number
you
have
china
you
have
norway
denmark
and
then
you
have
number
the
united
states
so
we
spend
the
most
and
we
at
the
bottom
of
the
heap
it
not
going
to
happen
anymore
folks
it
not
going
to
happen
anymore
we
are
going
to
build
our
military
which
thank
because
number
of
the
people
came
down
and
number
of
the
pundits
in
washington
we
love
our
military
we
love
our
military
and
by
the
way
we
love
our
police
our
police
are
terrific
we
love
our
police
they
are
not
being
treated
properly
we
going
to
build
our
military
so
big
so
good
so
strong
so
powerful
that
nobody
is
ever
going
to
mess
with
us
folks
and
we
going
to
buy
we
going
to
buy
the
equipment
that
our
generals
our
soldiers
that
everybody
that
in
the
know
want
we
not
buying
equipment
that
sells
because
they
have
political
pull
because
they
take
campaign
and
they
give
campaign
contributions
we
are
going
to
get
the
equipment
that
they
want
not
the
equipment
that
they
told
to
have
by
senators
and
congressmen
in
washington
we
going
to
have
great
equipment
and
the
reason
can
say
that
is
my
campaign
not
getting
millions
of
dollars
from
all
of
these
not
getting
millions
of
dollars
from
all
of
these
special
interests
and
lobbyists
and
donors
that
once
they
get
it
they
literally
do
whatever
the
politicians
want
that
not
going
to
happen
and
we
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
we
love
our
vets
and
they
being
treated
terribly
we
taking
care
of
our
vets
so
we
now
off
to
and
it
great
state
we
have
great
people
we
have
great
people
in
our
nation
no
matter
where
we
go
went
to
mobile
alabama
people
we
went
to
oklahoma
recently
twice
people
people
no
matter
where
we
go
we
fill
up
the
arenas
over
here
the
other
day
we
had
we
had
we
have
people
the
only
thing
that
stops
the
crowds
are
the
walls
because
we
get
them
in
we
have
to
send
thousands
of
people
away
time
magazine
time
magazine
last
year
did
an
incredible
cover
story
they
said
it
movement
and
that
what
it
is
it
an
incredible
movement
with
incredible
people
incredible
people
it
an
incredible
movement
with
incredible
people
tell
you
and
whether
we
go
honestly
whether
we
go
to
dallas
or
whether
we
go
anywhere
you
say
you
go
to
you
go
anywhere
you
say
our
people
are
incredible
and
our
theme
what
our
theme
you
know
it
right
our
theme
which
love
may
be
the
greatest
theme
of
all
time
right
and
the
word
again
eventually
is
going
to
come
off
we
going
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
theme
because
what
going
to
happen
make
america
great
again
right
and
the
last
two
weeks
because
gotten
to
see
so
many
guess
millions
when
you
add
them
all
up
with
all
of
these
rooms
and
all
of
these
speeches
and
met
so
many
people
but
the
people
are
so
incredible
that
been
saying
make
america
great
again
and
it
going
to
be
greater
than
ever
before
that
the
kind
of
potential
we
have
greater
then
every
before
see
how
there
is
any
room
for
misunderstanding
or
misinterpretation
of
the
statement
made
on
june
during
my
presidential
announcement
here
is
what
said
and
yet
this
statement
is
deliberately
distorted
by
the
media
when
mexico
meaning
the
mexican
government
sends
its
people
not
sending
their
best
not
sending
you
pointing
to
the
audience
not
sending
you
pointing
again
sending
people
that
have
lots
of
problems
and
bringing
those
problems
to
us
bringing
bringing
crime
rapists
and
some
assume
are
good
people
but
speak
to
border
guards
and
they
tell
us
what
getting
and
it
only
makes
common
sense
sending
us
not
the
right
people
coming
from
more
than
mexico
coming
from
all
over
south
and
latin
america
and
coming
probably
from
the
middle
east
but
we
know
because
we
have
no
protection
and
we
have
no
competence
we
know
happening
and
got
to
stop
and
got
to
stop
fast
what
can
be
simpler
or
more
accurately
stated
the
mexican
government
is
forcing
their
most
unwanted
people
into
the
united
states
they
are
in
many
cases
criminals
drug
dealers
rapists
this
was
evident
just
this
week
when
as
an
example
young
woman
in
san
was
viciously
killed
by
time
deported
mexican
with
long
criminal
record
who
was
forced
back
into
the
united
states
because
they
want
him
in
mexico
this
is
merely
one
of
thousands
of
similar
incidents
throughout
the
united
states
in
other
words
the
worst
elements
in
mexico
are
being
pushed
into
the
united
states
by
the
mexican
government
the
largest
suppliers
of
heroin
cocaine
and
other
illicit
drugs
are
mexican
cartels
that
arrange
to
have
mexican
immigrants
trying
to
cross
the
borders
and
smuggle
in
the
drugs
the
border
patrol
knows
this
likewise
tremendous
infectious
disease
is
pouring
across
the
border
the
united
states
has
become
dumping
ground
for
mexico
and
in
fact
for
many
other
parts
of
the
world
on
the
other
hand
many
fabulous
people
come
in
from
mexico
and
our
country
is
better
for
it
but
these
people
are
here
legally
and
are
severely
hurt
by
those
coming
in
illegally
am
proud
to
say
that
know
many
hard
working
of
them
are
working
for
and
with
me
and
just
like
our
country
my
is
better
for
it
the
mexican
government
wants
an
open
border
as
long
as
one
way
open
border
into
the
united
states
not
only
are
they
killing
us
at
the
border
but
they
are
killing
us
on
trade
and
the
country
of
mexico
is
making
billions
of
dollars
in
doing
so
have
great
respect
for
mexico
and
love
their
people
and
their
great
spirit
the
problem
is
however
that
their
leaders
are
far
smarter
more
cunning
and
better
negotiators
than
ours
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
will
represent
far
better
than
anyone
else
as
president
the
mexican
government
is
not
our
friend
and
why
should
they
be
when
the
relationship
is
totally
one
sided
in
their
on
both
illegal
immigration
and
trade
have
pointed
this
out
during
my
speeches
and
it
is
something
mexico
want
me
to
say
in
actuality
it
was
only
after
my
significant
rise
in
the
polls
that
previously
my
friend
went
ballistic
believe
that
my
examples
of
bad
trade
deals
for
the
united
states
was
of
even
more
concern
to
the
mexican
government
than
my
talk
of
border
security
have
lost
lot
during
this
presidential
run
defending
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
always
heard
that
it
is
very
hard
for
successful
person
to
run
for
president
and
have
all
taken
the
weak
and
very
sad
position
of
being
politically
correct
even
though
they
are
wrong
in
terms
of
what
is
good
for
our
country
because
of
their
business
comes
from
mexico
in
my
opinion
is
being
dictated
to
by
the
mexican
government
the
last
thing
mexico
wants
is
trump
as
president
in
that
will
make
great
trade
deals
for
the
united
states
and
will
have
an
impenetrable
border
only
legally
approved
people
will
come
through
easily
interestingly
has
just
announced
they
are
attempting
to
go
public
despite
very
poor
and
even
negative
earnings
which
is
not
good
situation
for
successful
or
high
stock
to
mention
that
am
currently
suing
them
for
breach
of
contract
remember
is
the
one
who
began
this
charade
in
the
first
place
and
they
are
owned
by
one
of
biggest
backers
after
the
was
made
there
were
numerous
compliments
and
indeed
many
rave
reviews
was
very
little
criticism
it
until
week
after
my
announcement
that
people
started
to
totally
distort
these
very
easy
to
understand
words
if
there
was
something
stated
incorrectly
it
would
have
been
brought
up
immediately
and
with
great
enthusiasm
the
issues
have
addressed
and
continue
to
address
are
vital
steps
to
make
america
great
again
additionally
would
be
the
best
jobs
president
that
god
ever
created
get
to
work
trump
this
was
going
to
be
on
and
all
of
the
bad
things
and
we
all
know
going
on
and
especially
how
poor
do
as
president
in
these
very
very
troubled
times
of
radical
islamic
terrorism
trump
even
her
former
secret
service
agent
seen
her
under
pressure
and
in
times
of
stress
has
stated
that
she
lacks
the
temperament
and
integrity
to
be
our
president
there
will
be
plenty
of
opportunity
to
discuss
these
important
issues
at
later
time
and
will
deliver
that
very
very
soon
but
today
only
one
thing
to
discuss
the
growing
threat
of
terrorism
inside
of
our
borders
the
attack
on
the
pulse
nightclub
in
florida
was
the
worst
terror
strike
on
our
soil
since
september
and
the
worst
mass
shooting
in
our
history
so
many
people
just
hard
to
believe
but
just
so
many
people
dead
so
many
people
gravely
injured
so
much
carnage
such
disgrace
the
horror
is
beyond
description
the
families
of
these
wonderful
people
are
totally
devastated
and
they
will
be
forever
likewise
our
whole
nation
and
indeed
the
whole
world
is
devastated
we
express
our
deepest
sympathies
to
the
victims
the
wounded
and
their
families
we
mourn
as
one
people
for
our
loss
and
pledge
our
support
to
any
and
all
who
need
it
would
like
to
ask
now
that
we
all
observe
moment
of
silence
for
the
victims
of
this
attack
thank
you
our
nation
stands
together
in
solidarity
with
the
members
of
community
they
have
been
through
something
that
nobody
could
ever
experience
this
is
very
dark
moment
in
history
radical
islamic
terrorist
targeted
the
nightclub
not
only
because
he
wanted
to
kill
americans
but
in
order
to
execute
gay
and
lesbian
citizens
because
of
their
sexual
orientation
strike
at
the
heart
and
soul
of
who
we
are
as
nation
an
assault
on
the
ability
of
free
people
to
live
their
lives
love
who
they
want
and
express
their
identity
an
attack
on
the
right
of
every
single
american
to
live
in
peace
and
safety
in
their
own
country
we
need
to
respond
to
this
attack
on
america
as
one
united
people
with
force
purpose
and
determination
but
the
current
politically
correct
response
cripples
our
ability
to
talk
and
to
think
and
act
clearly
not
acting
clearly
not
talking
clearly
got
problems
if
we
get
tough
and
if
we
get
smart
and
fast
not
going
to
have
our
country
anymore
there
will
be
nothing
absolutely
nothing
left
the
killer
whose
name
will
not
use
or
ever
say
was
born
in
afghan
of
afghan
parents
who
immigrated
to
the
united
states
his
father
published
support
for
the
afghan
regime
which
murders
those
who
share
its
radical
views
and
they
murdered
plenty
the
father
even
said
he
was
running
for
president
of
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
only
reason
the
killer
was
in
america
in
the
first
place
was
because
we
allowed
his
family
to
come
here
that
is
fact
and
fact
we
need
to
talk
about
we
have
dysfunctional
immigration
system
which
does
not
permit
us
to
know
who
we
let
into
our
country
and
it
does
not
permit
us
to
protect
our
citizens
properly
we
have
an
incompetent
administration
and
if
elected
president
that
will
not
change
will
tell
you
that
will
not
change
over
the
next
four
years
we
have
an
administration
that
will
not
change
but
if
get
in
there
going
to
change
and
going
to
change
quickly
going
from
totally
incompetent
to
just
the
opposite
believe
me
trump
thank
you
with
people
dead
and
perhaps
more
ultimately
and
dozens
more
wounded
we
can
not
afford
to
talk
around
issues
anymore
we
have
to
address
these
issues
called
for
ban
after
san
and
was
met
with
great
scorn
and
anger
but
now
many
years
and
have
to
say
many
years
but
many
are
saying
that
was
right
to
do
so
and
although
the
pause
is
temporary
we
must
find
out
what
is
going
on
we
have
to
do
it
it
will
be
lifted
this
ban
when
and
as
nation
in
position
to
properly
and
perfectly
screen
these
people
coming
into
our
country
pouring
in
and
we
know
what
doing
the
immigration
laws
of
the
united
states
give
the
president
powers
to
suspend
entry
into
the
country
of
any
class
of
persons
now
any
class
it
really
is
determined
and
to
be
determined
by
the
president
for
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
as
he
or
she
deems
appropriate
hopefully
he
in
this
case
thank
you
will
use
this
power
to
protect
the
american
people
when
elected
will
suspend
immigration
from
areas
of
the
world
where
proven
history
of
terrorism
against
the
united
states
europe
or
our
allies
until
we
fully
understand
how
to
end
these
threats
after
full
thank
you
and
by
the
way
we
have
no
choice
after
full
and
partial
and
long
really
long
overdue
security
assessment
we
will
develop
responsible
immigration
policy
that
serves
the
interests
and
values
of
america
we
can
not
continue
to
allow
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
to
pour
into
our
country
many
of
whom
have
the
same
thought
process
as
this
savage
killer
many
of
the
principles
of
radical
islam
are
incompatible
with
western
values
and
institutions
remember
this
radical
islam
is
and
american
refuse
to
allow
america
to
become
place
where
gay
people
christian
people
jewish
people
are
targets
of
persecution
and
intimation
by
radical
islamic
preachers
of
hate
and
violence
this
is
not
just
national
security
issue
quality
of
life
issue
if
we
want
to
protect
the
quality
of
life
for
all
americans
women
and
children
gay
and
straight
jews
and
and
all
people
then
we
need
to
tell
the
truth
about
radical
islam
and
we
need
to
do
it
now
we
need
to
tell
the
truth
also
about
how
radical
islam
is
coming
to
our
shores
and
coming
with
these
people
folks
coming
importing
radical
islamic
terrorism
into
the
west
through
failed
immigration
system
and
through
an
intelligence
community
held
back
by
our
president
even
our
own
director
has
admitted
that
we
can
not
effectively
check
the
backgrounds
of
people
letting
into
america
all
of
the
september
were
issued
visas
large
numbers
of
somali
refugees
in
have
tried
to
join
isis
the
boston
bombers
came
here
through
political
asylum
the
male
shooter
in
san
again
whose
name
will
not
mention
was
the
child
of
immigrants
from
pakistan
and
he
brought
his
wife
the
other
terrorist
from
saudi
arabia
through
another
one
of
our
easily
exploited
visa
programs
trump
immigration
from
into
the
united
states
has
increased
nearly
five
fold
five
fold
in
just
one
year
according
to
pew
research
percent
of
the
people
in
support
oppressive
law
we
admit
many
more
and
just
the
way
it
is
we
admit
many
more
from
other
countries
in
the
region
and
tell
you
what
they
share
these
oppressive
views
and
values
we
want
to
remain
free
and
open
society
then
and
if
we
do
then
we
have
to
control
our
borders
we
have
to
control
and
we
have
to
control
them
now
not
later
right
now
thank
you
yet
for
months
and
despite
so
many
attacks
repeatedly
refused
to
even
say
the
words
radical
islam
until
challenged
her
yesterday
and
guess
what
she
will
probably
say
them
she
sort
of
has
said
them
but
see
what
happens
she
really
has
no
choice
but
she
want
to
however
really
been
forced
and
she
has
been
forced
to
say
these
words
she
supports
and
the
reason
is
she
supports
so
much
of
what
is
wrong
and
what
is
wrong
with
this
country
and
going
wrong
with
our
country
and
our
borders
she
has
no
clue
in
my
opinion
what
radical
islam
is
and
she
speak
honestly
about
it
if
she
does
in
fact
know
in
total
denial
and
her
continuing
reluctance
to
ever
name
the
enemy
broadcasts
weakness
across
the
entire
world
true
weakness
know
if
you
know
this
but
just
few
weeks
before
san
the
slaughter
all
it
was
was
slaughter
explained
her
refusal
to
say
the
words
radical
islam
here
is
what
she
said
exact
quote
muslims
are
peaceful
and
tolerant
people
and
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
terrorism
that
is
so
she
says
the
solution
is
to
ban
guns
they
tried
that
in
france
which
has
among
the
toughest
gun
laws
anywhere
in
the
world
and
people
were
brutally
murdered
by
islamic
terrorists
in
cold
blood
her
plan
is
to
disarm
law
abiding
americans
abolishing
the
second
amendment
and
leaving
only
the
bad
guys
and
terrorists
with
guns
no
good
not
going
to
happen
folks
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
thank
you
she
wants
to
take
away
guns
and
then
admit
the
very
people
who
want
to
slaughter
us
let
them
come
into
the
country
we
have
guns
let
them
come
in
let
them
have
all
the
fun
they
want
will
be
meeting
with
the
which
has
given
me
their
earliest
endorsement
in
presidential
race
to
discuss
how
to
ensure
americans
have
the
means
to
protect
themselves
in
this
age
of
terror
will
be
always
defending
the
second
amendment
thank
you
thank
you
the
bottom
line
is
that
supports
policies
that
bring
the
threat
of
radical
islam
into
american
and
allow
it
to
grow
oversees
and
it
is
growing
in
fact
catastrophic
immigration
plan
will
bring
vastly
more
radical
islamic
immigration
into
this
country
threatening
not
only
our
society
but
our
entire
way
of
life
when
it
comes
to
radical
islamic
terrorism
ignorance
is
not
bliss
deadly
totally
deadly
the
administration
with
the
support
of
and
others
has
also
damaged
our
security
by
restraining
our
intelligence
gathering
and
we
have
just
no
intelligence
gathering
information
we
need
this
information
so
badly
and
he
stopped
it
we
have
the
support
we
have
the
support
of
the
law
enforcement
system
because
is
not
letting
them
do
their
job
they
are
not
being
allowed
to
do
their
job
and
they
can
do
it
well
better
than
anybody
we
need
new
leader
we
need
new
leader
fast
trump
thank
you
they
have
put
political
correctness
above
common
sense
above
your
safety
and
above
all
else
refuse
to
be
politically
correct
want
to
do
the
right
thing
want
to
straighten
things
out
and
want
to
make
america
great
again
the
days
of
deadly
ignorance
will
end
and
they
will
end
soon
if
elected
as
president
will
give
our
intelligence
community
law
enforcement
and
military
the
tools
they
need
to
prevent
terrorist
attacks
they
have
those
tools
now
we
need
an
intelligence
gathering
system
second
to
none
second
to
none
that
includes
better
cooperation
between
state
local
and
federal
officials
and
with
our
allies
very
importantly
will
have
an
attorney
general
director
of
national
intelligence
and
secretary
of
know
how
to
fight
war
on
radical
islamic
terrorism
and
they
will
have
the
support
that
they
need
to
get
the
job
done
right
not
like
it
is
right
now
not
right
we
also
must
ensure
the
american
people
are
provided
the
information
they
need
to
understand
the
threat
the
senate
subcommittee
on
immigration
has
already
identified
hundreds
of
immigrants
charged
with
terrorist
activities
inside
the
united
states
since
september
nearly
year
ago
the
senate
subcommittee
asked
president
department
of
justice
state
and
homeland
security
to
provide
the
immigration
history
of
all
terrorists
inside
the
united
states
these
departments
refused
to
comply
nobody
even
knows
why
they
refused
to
comply
president
must
release
the
full
and
complete
immigration
histories
of
all
individuals
implicated
in
terrorist
activities
of
any
kind
since
september
so
important
the
public
has
right
to
know
how
these
people
got
here
how
they
came
on
to
this
great
land
why
are
they
here
we
have
to
screen
applicants
to
know
whether
they
are
affiliated
with
or
supporting
radical
groups
and
beliefs
very
simple
we
have
to
control
the
amount
of
future
immigration
into
this
country
and
we
have
to
prevent
large
pockets
of
from
forming
inside
america
not
complicated
every
and
just
think
of
this
take
look
every
single
event
even
single
individual
can
be
devastating
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
take
look
at
what
happened
in
and
what
happened
in
other
cases
just
single
event
and
just
one
person
can
you
imagine
what
do
in
large
groups
which
allowing
now
to
come
here
truly
our
president
know
what
doing
failed
us
and
failed
us
badly
under
his
leadership
this
situation
will
not
get
any
better
it
will
only
get
worse
and
been
saying
that
for
long
time
each
year
the
united
states
permanently
admits
immigrants
from
the
middle
east
and
many
more
from
muslim
countries
outside
of
the
middle
east
our
government
has
been
admitting
growing
numbers
year
after
year
without
any
effective
plan
for
our
own
security
in
fact
state
department
was
in
charge
of
admissions
and
the
admissions
process
for
people
applying
to
enter
from
overseas
having
learned
nothing
from
these
attacks
she
now
plans
to
massively
increase
admissions
without
screening
plan
including
percent
increase
in
syrian
refugees
coming
into
our
country
tell
me
tell
me
how
stupid
is
that
this
could
be
better
bigger
more
horrible
version
than
the
legendary
horse
ever
was
altogether
under
the
plan
be
admitting
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
from
the
middle
east
with
no
system
to
vet
them
or
to
prevent
the
of
the
children
and
their
children
not
only
their
children
by
the
way
trying
to
take
over
our
children
and
convince
them
how
wonderful
isis
is
and
how
wonderful
islam
is
and
we
know
happening
trump
the
burden
is
on
to
tell
us
why
she
believes
immigration
from
these
dangerous
countries
should
be
increased
without
any
effective
system
to
really
to
screen
not
screening
people
so
why
we
have
an
effective
screening
system
we
being
laughed
at
all
over
the
world
the
burden
is
on
to
tell
us
why
we
should
admit
anyone
into
our
country
who
supports
violence
of
any
kind
against
gay
and
lesbian
americans
the
burden
is
on
to
tell
us
how
she
will
pay
for
it
her
plan
will
cost
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
long
term
this
be
money
better
spent
rebuilding
america
for
our
current
population
including
the
many
poor
people
already
living
here
we
have
cities
we
have
inner
cities
we
have
poverty
all
over
and
this
is
how
spending
billions
of
dollars
we
have
to
stop
the
tremendous
flow
of
syrian
refugees
into
the
united
states
we
know
who
they
are
they
have
no
documentation
and
we
know
what
planning
and
we
unless
we
have
proper
supervisor
and
proper
leadership
in
which
case
out
of
here
what
want
what
want
is
common
sense
want
mainstream
immigration
policy
that
promotes
american
values
choice
put
before
the
american
people
mainstream
immigration
policy
designed
to
benefit
america
or
radical
immigration
policy
designed
to
benefit
politically
correct
special
interests
all
it
is
got
to
get
smart
and
tough
and
vigilant
and
got
to
do
it
now
because
later
is
too
late
going
to
be
too
late
for
our
country
the
media
talks
about
home
grown
terrorism
but
islamic
radicalism
and
very
very
important
term
term
that
the
president
refuses
to
use
and
the
networks
that
nurture
it
are
imports
from
overseas
whether
you
like
it
or
whether
you
like
it
yes
there
are
many
people
already
inside
our
country
as
result
of
poor
policies
of
the
past
but
the
whole
point
is
that
we
will
be
much
much
and
it
will
be
easier
to
deal
with
our
current
problem
if
we
keep
on
bringing
people
who
add
to
the
problem
and
what
doing
letting
all
of
these
people
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
come
in
and
all
doing
is
adding
to
this
incredible
problem
we
have
for
instance
the
controversial
mosque
attended
by
the
boston
bombers
had
at
its
founder
and
as
its
founder
an
immigrant
from
overseas
charged
in
an
assassination
plot
this
shooter
and
amazingly
in
was
the
child
of
an
immigrant
father
who
supported
one
of
the
most
repressive
regimes
on
earth
why
would
we
admit
people
who
support
violent
hatred
can
never
claim
to
be
friend
of
the
gay
community
as
long
as
she
continues
to
support
immigration
policies
that
bring
islamic
extremists
to
our
country
and
who
suppress
women
gays
and
anyone
who
share
their
views
or
values
she
have
it
both
ways
she
claim
to
be
supportive
of
these
communities
while
trying
to
increase
the
number
of
people
coming
in
who
want
to
oppress
these
same
communities
how
does
this
kind
of
immigration
make
our
lives
better
how
does
this
kind
of
immigration
make
our
country
better
why
does
want
to
bring
people
in
in
vast
numbers
who
reject
our
values
why
explain
ask
yourself
who
is
really
the
friend
of
women
and
the
community
trump
with
actions
or
with
her
words
trump
will
tell
you
who
the
better
friend
is
and
some
day
believe
that
will
be
proven
out
and
by
the
way
the
community
is
just
happened
to
them
is
just
so
sad
and
to
be
thinking
about
where
their
policies
are
currently
with
this
administration
is
disgrace
to
that
community
will
tell
you
right
now
wants
to
allow
radical
islamic
terrorists
to
pour
into
our
country
they
enslave
women
and
they
murder
gays
want
them
in
our
country
immigration
is
privilege
and
we
should
not
let
anyone
into
this
country
who
support
our
communities
all
of
our
communities
every
single
one
of
them
americans
already
admitted
four
times
more
immigrants
than
any
country
on
earth
anybody
in
the
world
four
times
more
at
least
because
we
even
know
coming
in
and
we
continue
to
admit
millions
more
with
no
real
checks
or
scrutiny
not
surprisingly
wages
for
our
workers
budged
in
almost
years
you
wonder
why
we
get
the
crowds
you
wonder
why
we
get
this
tremendous
support
you
wonder
why
gotten
more
votes
than
any
republican
in
any
primary
in
the
history
of
the
republican
party
take
look
at
that
take
look
at
your
security
take
look
at
the
wages
for
years
been
stagnant
even
gone
down
so
whether
matter
of
national
security
or
financial
security
we
afford
to
keep
on
going
like
this
can
not
afford
it
we
owe
trillion
in
debt
and
no
longer
have
any
options
our
communities
from
all
backgrounds
are
ready
for
some
relief
this
is
not
an
act
of
against
anyone
really
an
act
of
want
us
all
all
of
us
to
work
together
we
have
to
form
partnership
with
our
muslim
communities
we
have
muslim
communities
in
this
country
that
are
great
and
we
have
to
form
that
partnership
now
the
muslim
community
so
important
they
have
to
work
with
us
they
have
to
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
and
turn
in
the
people
who
they
know
are
bad
they
know
it
and
they
have
to
do
it
and
they
have
to
do
it
forthwith
want
to
fix
our
schools
want
to
fix
our
bridges
and
our
jobs
market
going
to
have
it
rocket
again
going
to
make
great
trade
deals
but
want
every
american
to
succeed
including
muslims
but
the
muslims
have
to
work
with
us
they
have
to
work
with
us
they
know
going
on
they
know
that
he
was
bad
they
knew
the
people
in
san
were
bad
but
you
know
what
they
turn
them
in
and
you
know
what
we
had
death
and
destruction
wants
to
empty
out
the
treasury
to
bring
people
into
the
country
that
include
individuals
who
preach
hate
against
our
citizens
want
to
protect
our
citizens
all
of
our
citizens
the
terrorist
attack
on
pulse
nightclub
demands
full
and
complete
investigation
into
every
single
aspect
of
the
assault
in
san
as
an
example
people
who
knew
what
was
going
on
they
knew
exactly
but
they
used
the
excuse
of
racial
profiling
for
not
reporting
it
they
said
oh
we
thought
so
but
we
want
to
use
racial
profiling
which
was
probably
an
excuse
given
to
them
by
their
lawyer
so
they
get
in
trouble
we
need
to
know
what
the
killer
discussed
with
his
relatives
parents
friends
and
associates
we
need
to
know
if
he
was
affiliated
with
any
radical
mosques
or
radical
activists
and
what
if
any
is
their
immigration
status
we
have
to
know
and
we
have
to
know
fast
we
need
to
know
if
he
anywhere
and
who
he
with
we
need
to
know
and
we
need
to
make
sure
every
single
last
person
involved
in
this
plan
including
anyone
who
knew
something
but
tell
us
is
brought
to
justice
so
when
people
know
going
on
and
they
tell
us
and
we
have
an
attack
and
people
die
these
people
have
to
have
consequences
big
consequences
america
must
do
more
much
more
to
protect
its
citizens
especially
people
who
are
potential
victims
of
crimes
based
on
their
backgrounds
or
sexual
orientation
as
you
just
saw
in
trump
it
also
means
we
must
change
our
foreign
policy
the
decision
to
overthrow
the
regime
in
libya
then
pushing
for
the
overthrow
of
the
regime
in
syria
among
other
things
without
plans
for
the
day
after
have
created
space
for
isis
to
expand
and
grow
like
nobody
has
ever
seen
before
these
actions
along
with
our
disastrous
iran
deal
have
also
reduced
our
ability
to
work
in
partnership
with
our
muslim
allies
in
the
region
that
is
why
our
new
goal
must
be
to
defeat
islamic
terrorism
not
nation
building
no
more
nation
building
never
going
to
work
and
by
the
way
spent
almost
trillion
over
the
years
on
trying
to
nation
build
in
the
middle
east
and
it
has
been
complete
and
total
disaster
further
away
now
than
we
were
years
ago
for
instance
the
last
major
nato
mission
was
war
in
libya
that
mission
helped
to
unleash
isis
on
new
continent
said
nato
need
to
change
its
focus
and
stop
terrorism
we
have
to
focus
on
terrorism
and
we
have
to
stop
terrorism
since
raised
that
criticism
and
gotten
no
credit
for
it
but
these
are
minor
details
nato
has
since
announced
new
initiative
front
page
of
the
wall
street
journal
four
days
ago
focused
on
just
that
america
must
unite
the
whole
world
in
the
fight
against
islamic
terrorism
pretty
much
like
we
did
with
communism
during
the
cold
war
we
tried
it
president
way
work
he
gave
the
world
his
apology
tour
we
got
isis
and
many
other
problems
in
return
what
we
got
remember
the
famous
apology
tour
sorry
for
everything
like
to
conclude
my
remarks

good
evening
thank
you
very
much
speak
to
you
today
as
lifelong
supporter
and
true
friend
of
israel
am
newcomer
to
politics
but
not
to
backing
the
jewish
state
in
late
weeks
after
the
attacks
on
new
york
city
and
on
washington
and
frankly
the
attacks
on
all
of
us
attacks
that
perpetrated
and
they
were
perpetrated
by
the
islamic
fundamentalists
mayor
visited
israel
to
show
solidarity
with
terror
victims
sent
my
plane
because
backed
the
mission
for
israel
percent
in
spring
of
at
the
height
of
the
violence
in
the
strip
was
the
grand
marshal
of
the
salute
to
israel
parade
the
largest
single
gathering
in
support
of
the
jewish
state
it
was
very
dangerous
time
for
israel
and
frankly
for
anyone
supporting
israel
many
people
turned
down
this
did
not
took
the
risk
and
glad
did
but
come
here
tonight
to
pander
to
you
about
israel
what
politicians
do
all
talk
no
action
believe
me
came
here
to
speak
to
you
about
where
stand
on
the
future
of
american
relations
with
our
strategic
ally
our
unbreakable
friendship
and
our
cultural
brother
the
only
democracy
in
the
middle
east
the
state
of
israel
my
number
one
priority
is
to
dismantle
the
disastrous
deal
with
iran
have
been
in
business
long
time
know
and
let
me
tell
you
this
deal
is
catastrophic
for
america
for
israel
and
for
the
whole
of
the
middle
east
the
problem
here
is
fundamental
we
have
rewarded
the
leading
state
sponsor
of
terror
with
billion
dollars
and
we
received
absolutely
nothing
in
return
studied
this
issue
in
great
detail
would
say
actually
greater
by
far
than
anybody
else
believe
me
and
bad
deal
the
biggest
concern
with
the
deal
is
not
necessarily
that
iran
is
going
to
violate
it
because
already
as
you
know
it
has
the
bigger
problem
is
that
they
can
keep
the
terms
and
still
get
the
bomb
by
simply
running
out
the
clock
and
of
course
keep
the
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
that
we
so
stupidly
and
foolishly
gave
them
the
deal
even
require
iran
to
dismantle
its
military
nuclear
capability
yes
it
places
limits
on
its
military
nuclear
program
for
only
certain
number
of
years
but
when
those
restrictions
expire
iran
will
have
an
industrial
size
military
nuclear
capability
ready
to
go
and
with
zero
provision
for
delay
no
matter
how
bad
is
terrible
terrible
situation
that
we
are
all
placed
in
and
especially
israel
when
president
will
adopt
strategy
that
focuses
on
three
things
when
it
comes
to
iran
first
we
will
stand
up
to
aggressive
push
to
and
dominate
the
region
iran
is
very
big
problem
and
will
continue
to
be
but
if
not
elected
president
know
how
to
deal
with
trouble
and
believe
me
why
going
to
be
elected
president
folks
and
we
are
leading
in
every
poll
remember
that
please
iran
is
problem
in
iraq
problem
in
syria
problem
in
lebanon
problem
in
yemen
and
will
be
very
very
major
problem
for
saudi
arabia
literally
every
day
iran
provides
more
and
better
weapons
to
support
their
puppet
states
lebanon
received
and
tell
you
what
it
has
received
sophisticated
weapons
weapons
and
systems
and
rockets
like
very
few
people
anywhere
in
the
world
and
certainly
very
few
countries
have
now
in
syria
trying
to
establish
another
front
against
israel
from
the
syrian
side
of
the
heights
in
iran
is
supporting
and
islamic
jihad
and
in
the
west
bank
openly
offering
per
terror
attack
and
for
every
home
been
destroyed
deplorable
deplorable
situation
iran
is
financing
military
forces
throughout
the
middle
east
and
absolutely
incredible
that
we
handed
them
over
billion
to
do
even
more
toward
the
many
horrible
acts
of
terror
secondly
we
will
totally
dismantle
global
terror
network
which
is
big
and
powerful
but
not
powerful
like
us
iran
has
seeded
terror
groups
all
over
the
world
during
the
last
five
years
iran
has
perpetrated
terror
attacks
in
different
countries
on
five
continents
got
terror
cells
everywhere
including
in
the
western
hemisphere
very
close
to
home
iran
is
the
biggest
sponsor
of
terrorism
around
the
world
and
we
will
work
to
dismantle
that
reach
believe
me
believe
me
third
at
the
very
least
we
must
enforce
the
terms
of
the
previous
deal
to
hold
iran
totally
accountable
and
we
will
enforce
it
like
never
seen
contract
enforced
before
folks
believe
me
iran
has
already
since
the
deal
is
in
place
ballistic
missiles
three
times
those
ballistic
missiles
with
range
of
miles
were
designed
to
intimidate
not
only
israel
which
is
only
miles
away
but
also
intended
to
frighten
europe
and
maybe
someday
hit
even
the
united
states
and
not
going
to
let
that
happen
not
letting
it
happen
and
not
letting
it
happen
to
israel
believe
me
do
you
want
to
hear
something
really
shocking
as
many
of
the
great
people
in
this
room
know
painted
on
those
missiles
in
both
hebrew
and
were
the
words
israel
must
be
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
you
can
forget
that
what
kind
of
demented
minds
write
that
in
hebrew
and
you
talk
about
twisted
another
twisted
part
testing
these
missiles
does
not
even
violate
the
horrible
deal
that
we
made
the
deal
is
silent
on
test
missiles
but
those
tests
do
violate
united
nations
security
council
resolutions
the
problem
is
no
one
has
done
anything
about
it
we
will
we
will
promise
we
will
which
brings
me
to
my
next
point
the
utter
weakness
and
incompetence
of
the
united
nations
the
united
nations
is
not
friend
of
democracy
not
friend
to
freedom
not
friend
even
to
the
united
states
of
america
where
as
you
know
it
has
its
home
and
it
surely
is
not
friend
to
israel
with
president
in
his
final
year
he
may
be
the
worst
thing
to
ever
happen
to
israel
believe
me
believe
me
and
you
know
it
and
you
know
it
better
than
anybody
so
with
the
president
in
his
final
year
discussions
have
been
swirling
about
an
attempt
to
bring
security
council
resolution
on
terms
of
an
eventual
agreement
between
israel
and
let
me
be
clear
an
agreement
imposed
by
the
united
nations
would
be
total
and
complete
disaster
the
united
states
must
oppose
this
resolution
and
use
the
power
of
our
veto
which
will
use
as
president
percent
when
people
ask
why
because
not
how
you
make
deal
deals
are
made
when
parties
come
together
they
come
to
table
and
they
negotiate
each
side
must
give
up
something
it
values
mean
we
have
to
do
something
where
value
in
exchange
for
something
that
it
requires
what
deal
is
deal
is
really
something
that
when
we
impose
it
on
israel
and
we
bring
together
group
of
people
that
come
up
with
something
not
going
to
happen
with
the
united
nations
it
will
only
further
very
importantly
it
will
only
further
israel
it
will
be
catastrophe
and
disaster
for
israel
not
going
to
happen
folks
and
further
it
would
reward
terrorism
because
every
day
stabbing
israelis
and
even
americans
just
last
week
american
taylor
force
west
point
young
person
who
served
in
iraq
and
was
murdered
in
the
street
by
you
reward
like
that
you
can
not
do
it
there
is
only
one
way
you
treat
that
kind
of
you
have
to
confront
it
so
not
up
the
united
nations
to
go
with
solution
really
the
parties
that
must
negotiate
resolution
themselves
you
have
no
choice
they
have
to
do
it
themselves
or
it
will
never
hold
up
anyway
the
united
states
can
be
useful
as
facilitator
of
negotiations
but
no
one
should
be
telling
israel
that
it
must
abide
by
some
agreement
made
by
others
thousands
of
miles
away
that
even
really
know
happening
to
israel
to
anything
in
the
area
so
preposterous
not
going
to
let
that
happen
when
president
believe
me
will
veto
any
attempt
by
the
to
impose
its
will
on
the
jewish
state
it
will
be
vetoed
percent
you
see
know
about
what
do
wrote
art
of
the
one
of
the
and
mean
seriously
saying
because
be
as
though
say
so
going
to
be
very
diplomatic
one
of
be
think
it
is
number
one
but
why
take
chance
one
of
the
books
about
deals
and
deal
making
to
make
great
deal
you
need
two
willing
participants
we
know
israel
is
willing
to
deal
israel
has
been
trying
to
sit
down
at
the
negotiating
table
without
for
years
you
had
camp
david
in
where
prime
minister
made
an
incredible
offer
maybe
even
too
generous
rejected
it
in
prime
minister
made
an
equally
generous
offer
the
authority
rejected
it
also
then
john
tried
to
come
up
with
framework
and
even
respond
not
even
to
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
of
america
they
even
respond
when
become
president
the
days
of
treating
israel
like
citizen
will
end
on
day
one
and
when
say
something
mean
it
mean
it
will
meet
with
prime
minister
immediately
have
known
him
for
many
years
and
be
able
to
work
closely
together
to
help
bring
stability
and
peace
to
israel
and
to
the
entire
region
meanwhile
every
single
day
you
have
rampant
incitement
and
children
being
taught
to
hate
israel
and
hate
the
jews
it
has
to
stop
when
you
live
in
society
where
the
firefighters
are
the
little
kids
want
to
be
firefighters
when
you
live
in
society
where
athletes
and
movie
stars
are
the
little
kids
want
to
be
athletes
and
movie
stars
in
society
the
are
those
who
murder
jews
we
let
this
continue
we
let
this
happen
any
longer
you
can
not
achieve
peace
if
terrorists
are
treated
as
martyrs
glorifying
terrorists
is
tremendous
barrier
to
peace
it
is
horrible
horrible
way
to
think
barrier
that
be
broken
that
will
end
and
end
soon
believe
me
in
textbooks
and
mosques
got
culture
of
hatred
that
has
been
fermenting
there
for
years
and
if
we
want
to
achieve
peace
got
to
go
out
and
got
to
start
this
educational
process
they
have
to
end
education
of
hatred
they
have
to
end
it
and
now
there
is
no
moral
israel
does
not
name
public
squares
after
terrorists
israel
does
not
pay
its
children
to
stab
random
you
see
what
president
gets
wrong
about
deal
making
is
that
he
constantly
applies
pressure
to
our
friends
and
rewards
our
enemies
and
you
see
that
happening
all
the
time
that
pattern
by
the
president
and
his
administration
including
former
secretary
of
state
who
is
total
disaster
by
the
way
she
and
president
have
treated
israel
very
very
badly
but
its
repeated
itself
over
and
over
again
and
has
done
nothing
to
embolden
those
who
hate
america
we
saw
that
with
releasing
the
billion
dollars
to
iran
in
the
hope
that
they
would
magically
join
the
world
community
it
happen
president
thinks
that
applying
pressure
to
israel
will
force
the
issue
but
precisely
the
opposite
that
happened
already
half
of
the
population
of
has
been
taken
over
by
the
isis
in
and
the
other
half
refuses
to
confront
the
first
half
so
very
difficult
situation
never
going
to
get
solved
unless
you
have
great
leadership
right
here
in
the
united
states
get
it
solved
one
way
or
the
other
we
will
get
it
solved
but
when
the
united
states
stands
with
israel
the
chances
of
peace
really
rise
and
rises
exponentially
what
will
happen
when
trump
is
president
of
the
united
states
we
will
move
the
american
embassy
to
the
eternal
capital
of
the
jewish
people

will
never
ever
back
down
thank

for
my
family

for
my
business
fought
for
my
employees
and
now
going
to
fight
for
you
the
american
people
like
nobody
has
ever
fought
before
and
not
politician
fighting
me
going
to
see
some
real
good
things
happen
just
remember
this
going
to
be
your
champion
going
to
be
champion
because
you
see
this
election
about
republican
or
democrat
about
who
runs
this
country
the
special
interests
or
the
people
and
mean
the
american
people
every
election
year
politicians
promise
change
promised
change
and
it
work
out
too
well
and
every
year
they
fail
to
deliver
why
would
politicians
want
to
change
system
totally
rigged
in
order
to
keep
them
in
power
what
doing
folks
why
would
politicians
want
to
change
system
made
them
and
their
friends
very
very
wealthy
beat
rigged
system
by
winning
with
overwhelming
support
the
only
way
you
done
it
landslides
all
over
the
country
with
every
demographic
on
track
to
win
primary
caucus
victories
in
field
that
began
with
very
talented
people
after
years
of
disappointment
there
is
one
thing
we
all
have
learned
we
fix
the
rigged
system
by
relying
on
very
and
mean
this
so
so
strongly
on
the
very
people
who
rigged
it
and
they
rigged
it
and
do
not
ever
think
anything
differently
we
solve
our
problems
by
counting
on
the
politicians
who
created
our
problems
the
have
turned
the
politics
of
personal
enrichment
into
an
art
form
for
themselves
made
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
selling
access
selling
selling
government
contracts
and
mean
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
secretary
even
did
all
of
the
work
on
totally
illegal
private
server
something
about
how
getting
away
with
this
folks
nobody
understands
designed
to
keep
her
corrupt
dealings
out
of
the
public
record
putting
the
security
of
the
entire
country
at
risk
and
president
in
corrupt
system
is
totally
protecting
her
not
right
am
going
to
give
major
on
probably
monday
of
next
week
and
going
to
be
discussing
all
of
the
things
that
have
taken
place
with
the
think
going
to
find
it
very
informative
and
very
very
interesting
wonder
if
the
press
will
want
to
attend
who
knows
turned
the
state
department
into
her
private
hedge
fund
the
the
saudis
the
chinese
all
gave
money
to
bill
and
and
got
treatment
in
return
sad
day
in
america
when
foreign
governments
with
deep
pockets
have
more
influence
in
our
own
country
than
our
great
citizens
need
to
do
this
not
easy
believe
me
need
to
do
it
but
felt
had
to
give
back
to
our
wonderful
country
which
has
been
so
good
to
me
and
to
my
family
to
many
of
our
states
and
seen
the
suffering
in
eyes
visited
communities
in
new
york
new
jersey
indiana
and
ohio
whose
manufacturing
jobs
they
literally
these
jobs
have
virtually
disappeared
an
embarrassment
to
our
country
and
horrible
embraced
the
victims
of
illegal
immigration
moms
and
dads
who
have
had
to
bury
their
own
children
because
of
people
that
have
been
in
the
country
remember
it
folks
remember
it
visited
the
crumbling
cities
and
the
struggling
schools
seen
our
dilapidated
airports
highways
bridges
and
compared
them
to
other
countries
where
we
see
facilities
so
far
superior
to
ours
really
not
to
be
believed
hard
to
imagine
happened
to
our
country
america
is
getting
taken
apart
piece
by
piece
auctioned
off
and
just
rapidly
auctioned
off
to
the
highest
bidder
broke
broke
we
owe
trillion
dollars
going
quickly
to
trillion
our
infrastructure
is
disaster
our
schools
are
failing
crime
is
rising
people
are
scared
the
last
thing
we
need
is
in
the
white
house
or
an
extension
of
the
disaster
what
crowd
what
crowd
thank
you
all
very
much
we
love
our
country
we
love
our
country
but
we
can
turn
this
all
around
going
to
do
it
by
putting
america
first
that
commitment
is
the
foundation
for
change
been
missing
and
been
missing
for
long
time
important
to
understand
what
america
first
means
it
means
on
foreign
policy
we
will
never
enter
into
any
kind
conflict
unless
it
makes
us
safer
as
nation
it
has
to
make
us
safer
as
nation
this
is
the
opposite
of
foreign
policy
which
invaded
libya
iraq
unleashed
isis
and
threw
syria
into
chaos
and
created
the
mass
migration
which
is
wreaking
havoc
all
over
the
world
and
while
putting
iran
on
the
path
to
nuclear
weapons
and
making
them
dominant
power
in
the
middle
east
and
they
are
dominant
and
we
have
made
them
that
way
folks
we
have
made
them
that
way
you
better
hope
president
on
trade
america
first
means
the
american
worker
will
have
his
or
her
job
protected
from
unfair
foreign
competition
happening
there
is
absolutely
disgrace
no
right
about
that
and
you
mean
no
we
are
going
and
remember
this
we
are
only
going
to
have
great
trade
deals
we
are
only
going
to
have
that
not
going
to
approve
as
somebody
just
said
the
partnership
which
is
disaster
disaster
for
our
country
almost
as
bad
as
signed
by
bill
which
has
just
stripped
our
country
of
our
factories
and
our
manufacturing
and
moved
them
to
other
places
in
particular
mexico
if
not
great
deal
for
our
country
we
will
not
sign
it
got
to
be
great
for
our
country
for
our
community
for
everybody
in
here
because
believe
me
we
are
all
suffering
and
suffering
and
getting
worse
on
energy
policy
america
first
means
opening
up
great
potential
to
bring
wealth
and
prosperity
to
our
own
workers
including
our
wonderful
and
miners
who
have
been
absolutely
totally
mistreated
by
this
administration
on
economic
policy
america
first
means
having
tax
and
regulatory
policies
that
keep
jobs
and
wealth
in
the
united
states
substantially
lowering
taxes
for
middle
class
americans
and
business
likewise
regulation
which
is
strangling
our
economy
which
would
be
brought
down
from
its
present
insane
level
we
will
make
it
very
very
good
for
our
companies
for
our
small
business
and
for
people
that
want
to
survive
and
do
well
in
our
country
on
immigration
policy
america
first
means
protecting
the
jobs
wages
and
security
of
american
workers
whether
first
or
tenth
generation
no
matter
who
you
are
going
to
protect
your
job
because
let
me
tell
you
our
jobs
are
being
stripped
from
our
country
like
babies
the
beauty
of
america
first
is
that
it
brings
us
all
together
every
american
worker
of
every
background
is
entitled
to
the
same
benefits
protections
and
rights
and
privileges
got
to
be
that
way
now
the
people
in
charge
say
things
change
here
today
to
tell
you
that
we
have
to
change
we
have
no
choice
we
have
to
change
going
to
put
america
back
to
work
going
to
make
our
own
products
going
to
put
america
back
to
work
going
to
rebuild
our
inner
cities
which
are
absolutely
shame
and
so
sad
going
to
take
care
of
our
african
american
people
that
have
been
mistreated
for
so
long
going
to
make
you
and
your
family
safe
secure
and
prosperous

will
put
the
american
people
first

our
communities

our
country

again
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
will
make
america
great
again
remember
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
for
joining
me
today
this
was
going
to
be
on
and
how
bad
president
especially
in
these
times
of
radical
islamic
terrorism
she
would
be
even
her
former
secret
service
agent
who
has
seen
her
under
pressure
and
in
times
of
stress
has
stated
that
she
lacks
the
temperament
and
integrity
to
be
president
there
will
be
plenty
of
opportunity
to
discuss
these
important
issues
at
later
time
and
will
deliver
that
soon
but
today
there
is
only
one
thing
to
discuss
the
growing
threat
of
terrorism
inside
of
our
borders
the
attack
on
the
pulse
nightclub
in
florida
was
the
worst
terrorist
strike
on
our
soil
since
september
and
the
worst
mass
shooting
in
our
history
so
many
people
dead
so
many
people
gravely
injured
so
much
carnage
such
disgrace
the
horror
is
beyond
description
the
families
of
these
wonderful
people
are
totally
devastated
likewise
our
whole
nation
and
indeed
the
whole
world
is
devastated
we
express
our
deepest
sympathies
to
the
victims
the
wounded
and
their
families
we
mourn
as
one
people
for
our
loss
and
pledge
our
support
to
any
and
all
who
need
it
would
like
to
ask
now
that
we
all
observe
moment
of
silence
for
the
victims
of
the
attack
silence
our
nation
stands
together
in
solidarity
with
the
members
of
community
this
is
very
dark
moment
in
history
radical
islamic
terrorist
targeted
the
nightclub
not
only
because
he
wanted
to
kill
americans
but
in
order
to
execute
gay
and
lesbian
citizens
because
of
their
sexual
orientation
it
is
strike
at
the
heart
and
soul
of
who
we
are
as
nation
it
is
an
assault
on
the
ability
of
free
people
to
live
their
lives
love
who
they
want
and
express
their
identity
it
is
an
attack
on
the
right
of
every
single
american
to
live
in
peace
and
safety
in
their
own
country
we
need
to
respond
to
this
attack
on
america
as
one
united
people
with
force
purpose
and
determination
but
the
current
politically
correct
response
cripples
our
ability
to
talk
and
think
and
act
clearly
if
we
do
get
tough
and
we
do
get
smart
and
fast
we
not
going
to
have
country
anymore
there
will
be
nothing
left
the
killer
whose
name
will
not
use
or
ever
say
was
born
to
afghan
parents
who
immigrated
to
the
united
states
his
father
published
support
for
the
afghan
regime
which
murders
those
who
share
its
radical
views
the
father
even
said
he
was
running
for
president
of
that
country
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
only
reason
the
killer
was
in
america
in
the
first
place
was
because
we
allowed
his
family
to
come
here
that
is
fact
and
it
fact
we
need
to
talk
about
we
have
dysfunctional
immigration
system
which
does
not
permit
us
to
know
who
we
let
into
our
country
and
it
does
not
permit
us
to
protect
our
citizens
we
have
an
incompetent
administration
and
if
am
not
elected
president
that
will
not
change
over
the
next
four
years
but
it
must
change
and
it
must
change
now
with
fifty
people
dead
and
dozens
more
wounded
we
can
not
afford
to
talk
around
the
issue
anymore
we
have
to
address
it
head
on
called
for
ban
after
san
and
was
met
with
great
scorn
and
anger
but
now
many
are
saying
was
right
to
do
so
and
although
the
pause
is
temporary
we
must
find
out
what
is
going
on
the
ban
will
be
lifted
when
we
as
nation
are
in
position
to
properly
and
perfectly
screen
those
people
coming
into
our
country
the
immigration
laws
of
the
united
states
give
the
president
the
power
to
suspend
entry
into
the
country
of
any
class
of
persons
that
the
president
deems
detrimental
to
the
interests
or
security
of
the
united
states
as
he
deems
appropriate
will
use
this
power
to
protect
the
american
people
when
am
elected
will
suspend
immigration
from
areas
of
the
world
when
there
is
proven
history
of
terrorism
against
the
united
states
europe
or
our
allies
until
we
understand
how
to
end
these
threats
after
full
impartial
and
long
overdue
security
assessment
we
will
develop
responsible
immigration
policy
that
serves
the
interests
and
values
of
america
we
can
not
continue
to
allow
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
to
pour
into
our
country
many
of
whom
have
the
same
thought
process
as
this
savage
killer
many
of
the
principles
of
radical
islam
are
incompatible
with
western
values
and
institutions
radical
islam
is
and
refuse
to
allow
america
to
become
place
where
gay
people
christian
people
and
jewish
people
are
the
targets
of
persecution
and
intimidation
by
radical
islamic
preachers
of
hate
and
violence
not
just
national
security
issue
it
is
quality
of
life
issue
if
we
want
to
protect
the
quality
of
life
for
all
americans
women
and
children
gay
and
straight
jews
and
and
all
people
then
we
need
to
tell
the
truth
about
radical
islam
we
need
to
tell
the
truth
also
about
how
radical
islam
is
coming
to
our
shores
we
are
importing
radical
islamic
terrorism
into
the
west
through
failed
immigration
system
and
through
an
intelligence
community
held
back
by
our
president
even
our
own
director
has
admitted
that
we
can
not
effectively
check
the
backgrounds
of
the
people
we
are
letting
into
america
all
of
the
september
hijackers
were
issued
visas
large
numbers
of
somali
refugees
in
have
tried
to
join
isis
the
boston
bombers
came
here
through
political
asylum
the
male
shooter
in
san
again
whose
name
mention
was
the
child
of
immigrants
from
pakistan
and
he
brought
his
wife
the
other
terrorist
from
saudi
arabia
through
another
one
of
our
easily
exploited
visa
programs
immigration
from
into
the
united
states
has
increased
nearly
in
just
one
year
according
to
pew
research
of
people
in
support
oppressive
law
we
admit
many
more
from
other
countries
in
the
region
who
share
these
same
oppressive
views
if
we
want
to
remain
free
and
open
society
then
we
have
to
control
our
borders
yet
for
months
and
despite
so
many
attacks
repeatedly
refused
to
even
say
the
words
radical
islam
until
challenged
her
yesterday
to
say
the
words
or
leave
the
race
however
who
has
been
forced
to
say
the
words
today
after
policies
she
supports
have
caused
us
so
much
damage
still
has
no
clue
what
radical
islam
is
and
speak
honestly
about
what
it
is
she
is
in
total
denial
and
her
continuing
reluctance
to
ever
name
the
enemy
broadcasts
weakness
across
the
world
in
fact
just
few
weeks
before
the
san
slaughter
explained
her
refusal
to
say
the
words
radical
islam
here
is
what
she
said
muslims
are
peaceful
and
tolerant
people
and
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
terrorism
says
the
solution
is
to
ban
guns
they
tried
that
in
france
which
has
among
the
toughest
gun
laws
in
the
world
and
were
brutally
murdered
by
islamic
terrorists
in
cold
blood
her
plan
is
to
disarm
americans
abolishing
the
amendment
and
leaving
only
the
bad
guys
and
terrorists
with
guns
she
wants
to
take
away
guns
then
admit
the
very
people
who
want
to
slaughter
us
will
be
meeting
with
the
which
has
given
me
their
earliest
endorsement
in
presidential
race
to
discuss
how
to
ensure
americans
have
the
means
to
protect
themselves
in
this
age
of
terror
the
bottom
line
is
that
supports
the
policies
that
bring
the
threat
of
radical
islam
into
america
and
allow
it
to
grow
overseas
in
fact
catastrophic
immigration
plan
will
bring
vastly
more
radical
islamic
immigration
into
this
country
threatening
not
only
our
security
but
our
way
of
life
when
it
comes
to
radical
islamic
terrorism
ignorance
is
not
bliss
it
deadly
the
administration
with
the
support
of
and
others
has
also
damaged
our
security
by
restraining
our
and
failing
to
support
law
enforcement
they
have
put
political
correctness
above
common
sense
above
your
safety
and
above
all
else
refuse
to
be
politically
correct
will
do
the
right
thing
want
to
straighten
things
out
and
to
make
america
great
again
the
days
of
deadly
ignorance
will
end
and
they
will
end
soon
as
president
will
give
our
intelligence
community
law
enforcement
and
military
the
tools
they
need
to
prevent
terrorist
attacks
we
need
an
system
second
to
none
that
includes
better
cooperation
between
state
local
and
federal
officials
and
with
our
allies
will
have
an
attorney
general
director
of
national
intelligence
and
secretary
of
who
will
know
how
to
fight
the
war
on
radical
islamic
terrorism
and
who
will
have
the
support
they
require
to
get
the
job
done
we
also
must
ensure
the
american
people
are
provided
the
information
they
need
to
understand
the
threat
the
senate
subcommittee
on
immigration
has
already
identified
hundreds
of
immigrants
charged
with
terrorist
activities
inside
the
united
states
since
september
nearly
year
ago
the
senate
subcommittee
asked
president
departments
of
justice
state
and
homeland
security
to
provide
the
immigration
history
of
all
terrorists
inside
the
united
states
these
departments
refused
to
comply
president
must
release
the
full
and
complete
immigration
histories
of
all
individuals
implicated
in
terrorist
activity
of
any
kind
since
the
public
has
right
to
know
how
these
people
got
here
we
have
to
screen
applicants
to
know
whether
they
are
affiliated
with
or
support
radical
groups
and
beliefs
we
have
to
control
the
amount
of
future
immigration
into
this
country
to
prevent
large
pockets
of
from
forming
inside
america
even
single
individual
can
be
devastating
just
look
at
what
happened
in
can
you
imagine
large
groups
truly
our
president
does
know
what
he
is
doing
he
has
failed
us
and
failed
us
badly
and
under
his
leadership
this
situation
will
not
get
any
better
it
will
only
get
worse
each
year
the
united
states
permanently
admits
more
than
immigrants
from
the
middle
east
and
many
more
from
muslim
countries
outside
the
middle
east
our
government
has
been
admitting
numbers
year
after
year
without
any
effective
plan
for
our
security
in
fact
state
department
was
in
charge
of
the
admissions
process
for
people
applying
to
enter
from
overseas
having
learned
nothing
from
these
attacks
she
now
plans
to
massively
increase
admissions
without
screening
plan
including
increase
in
syrian
refugees
this
could
be
better
bigger
version
of
the
legendary
horse
we
let
this
happen
altogether
under
the
plan
you
be
admitting
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
from
the
middle
east
with
no
system
to
vet
them
or
to
prevent
the
of
their
children
the
burden
is
on
to
tell
us
why
she
believes
immigration
from
these
dangerous
countries
should
be
increased
without
any
effective
system
to
screen
who
we
are
bringing
in
the
burden
is
on
to
tell
us
why
we
should
admit
anyone
into
our
country
who
supports
violence
of
any
kind
against
gay
and
lesbian
americans
the
burden
is
also
on
to
tell
us
how
she
will
pay
for
it
her
plan
will
cost
americans
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
would
this
money
be
better
spent
on
rebuilding
america
for
our
current
population
including
the
many
poor
people
already
living
here
we
have
to
stop
the
tremendous
flow
of
syrian
refugees
into
the
united
states
we
do
know
who
they
are
they
have
no
documentation
and
we
do
know
what
they
planning
what
want
is
common
sense
want
mainstream
immigration
policy
that
promotes
american
values
that
is
the
choice
put
before
the
american
people
mainstream
immigration
policy
designed
to
benefit
america
or
radical
immigration
policy
designed
to
benefit
special
interests
we
got
to
get
smart
and
tough
and
vigilant
and
we
got
to
do
it
now
because
later
is
too
late
the
media
talks
about
terrorism
but
islamic
radicalism
and
the
networks
that
nurture
it
are
imports
from
overseas
yes
there
are
many
people
already
inside
our
country
as
result
of
the
poor
policies
of
the
past
but
the
whole
point
is
that
it
will
be
much
much
easier
to
deal
with
our
current
problem
if
we
keep
on
bringing
in
people
who
add
to
the
problem
for
instance
the
controversial
mosque
attended
by
the
boston
bombers
had
as
its
founder
an
immigrant
from
overseas
charged
in
an
assassination
plot
this
shooter
in
was
the
child
of
an
immigrant
father
who
supported
one
of
the
most
repressive
regimes
on
earth
why
would
we
admit
people
who
support
violent
hatred
can
never
claim
to
be
friend
of
the
gay
community
as
long
as
she
continues
to
support
immigration
policies
that
bring
islamic
extremists
to
our
country
who
suppress
women
gays
and
anyone
who
share
their
views
she
have
it
both
ways
she
claim
to
be
supportive
of
these
communities
while
trying
to
increase
the
number
of
people
coming
in
who
want
to
oppress
them
how
does
this
kind
of
immigration
make
our
life
better
how
does
this
kind
of
immigration
make
our
country
better
why
does
want
to
bring
people
vast
reject
our
values
ask
yourself
who
is
really
the
friend
of
women
and
the
community
trump
with
his
actions
or
with
her
words
wants
to
allow
radical
islamic
terrorists
to
pour
into
our
enslave
women
and
murder
gays
want
them
in
our
country
immigration
is
privilege
and
we
should
not
let
anyone
into
this
country
who
support
our
communities
all
of
our
communities
america
has
already
admitted
four
times
more
immigrants
than
any
country
on
earth
and
we
continue
to
admit
millions
more
with
no
real
checks
or
scrutiny
not
surprisingly
wages
for
our
workers
budged
in
many
years
so
whether
matter
of
national
security
or
financial
security
we
afford
to
keep
on
going
like
this
we
owe
trillion
in
debt
and
no
longer
have
options
all
our
communities
from
all
backgrounds
are
ready
for
some
relief
this
is
not
an
act
of
against
anyone
it
is
an
act
of
want
us
all
to
work
together
including
in
partnership
with
our
muslim
communities
but
muslim
communities
must
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
and
turn
in
the
people
who
they
know
are
bad
and
they
do
know
where
they
are
want
to
fix
our
schools
roads
bridges
and
job
market
want
every
american
to
succeed
wants
to
empty
out
the
treasury
to
bring
people
into
the
country
that
include
individuals
who
preach
hate
against
our
own
citizens
want
to
protect
our
citizens
all
of
our
citizens
the
terrorist
attack
on
the
pulse
night
club
demands
full
and
complete
investigation
into
every
aspect
of
the
assault
in
san
as
an
example
people
knew
what
was
going
on
but
they
used
the
excuse
of
racial
profiling
for
not
reporting
it
we
need
to
know
what
the
killer
discussed
with
his
relatives
parents
friends
and
associates
we
need
to
know
if
he
was
affiliated
with
any
radical
mosques
or
radical
activists
and
what
if
any
is
their
immigration
status
we
need
to
know
if
he
travelled
anywhere
and
who
he
travelled
with
we
need
to
make
sure
every
single
last
person
involved
in
this
plan
including
anyone
who
knew
something
but
did
tell
us
is
brought
to
justice
if
it
can
be
proven
that
somebody
had
information
about
any
attack
and
did
not
give
this
information
to
authorities
they
must
serve
prison
time
america
must
do
more
much
more
to
protect
its
citizens
especially
people
who
are
potential
victims
of
crimes
based
on
their
backgrounds
or
sexual
orientations
it
also
means
we
must
change
our
foreign
policy
the
decision
to
overthrow
the
regime
in
libya
then
pushing
for
the
overthrow
of
the
regime
in
syria
among
other
things
without
plans
for
the
day
after
have
created
space
for
isis
to
expand
and
grow
these
actions
along
with
our
disastrous
iran
deal
have
also
reduced
our
ability
to
work
in
partnership
with
our
muslim
allies
in
the
region
that
is
why
our
new
goal
must
be
to
defeat
islamic
terrorism
not
for
instance
the
last
major
nato
mission
was
war
in
libya
that
mission
helped
unleash
isis
on
new
continent
said
nato
needs
to
change
its
focus
to
stopping
terrorism
since
raised
that
criticism
nato
has
since
announced
new
initiative
focused
on
just
that
america
must
unite
the
whole
world
in
the
fight
against
islamic
terrorism
just
like
we
did
against
communism
in
the
cold
war
we
tried
it
president
way
he
gave
the
world
his
apology
tour
we
got
isis
and
many
other
problems
in
return
like
to
conclude
my
remarks
today
by
again
expressing
our
solidarity
with
the
people
of
who
have
come
under
attack
when
am
president
pledge
to
protect
and
defend
all
americans
who
live
inside
of
our
borders
wherever
they
come
from
wherever
they
were
born
all
americans
living
here
and
following
our
laws
will
be
protected
america
will
be
tolerant
and
open
society
america
will
also
be
safe
society
we
will
protect
our
borders
at
home
we
will
defeat
isis
overseas
we
will
ensure
every
parent
can
raise
their
children
in
peace
and
safety

make
america
rich

place
and
back
here
all
the
time
and
going
to
be
here
lot
in
january
going
to
be
so
sick
of
me
probably
say
we
give
the
caucus
just
forget
it
we
stand
the
guy

more
no
going
to
like
me
and
going
to
be
back
and
going
to
do
great
job
for
you
most
importantly
going
to
get
to
that
office
and
going
to
do
the
right
thing
going
to
do
the
right
thing
so
few
things
lot
so
much
has
happened
you
know
when
we
first
came
out
we
were
all
talking
together
and
we
were
talking
border
security
which
just
doing
so
great
with
the
border
security
going
to
build
wall
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
we
all
know
that
but
going
to
have
security
and
the
drugs
are
going
to
stop
and
the
people
that
are
going
to
come
into
the
country
but
going
to
come
into
the
country
going
to
be
legal
coming
in
legally
and
the
way
the
way
and
it
affects
so
much
so
we
were
talking
about
so
we
were
talking
about
that
we
were
talking
about
repealing
boom
going
to
be
repealed
going
to
be
replaced
know
if
been
seeing
happening
but
is
total
disaster
dying
of
its
own
weight
and
by
meaning
be
playing
golf
and
be
working
very
hard
but
instead
not
getting
the
people
signed
up
been
lot
of
talk
about
it
and
lot
of
stories
about
it
dead
but
terminate
it
quicker
than
that
and
we
will
come
up
with
something
that
will
be
so
good
so
much
better
premiums
are
going
through
the
roof
are
so
high
that
unless
close
to
death
never
going
to
get
to
use
and
even
then
think
going
to
get
to
use
it
really
so
going
to
take
care
of
that
and
by
the
way
we
have
lot
of
good
people
we
have
ethanol
nobody
is
really
we
have
the
ethanol
where
are
the
ethanol
people
right
was
here
month
ago
and
met
with
them
all
and
they
do
fantastic
job
toured
the
plants
and
they
do
fantastic
job
but
so
important
and
another
form
of
stay
away
from
and
stay
away
from
that
middle
east
stuff
so
important
actually
what
understand
because
the
one
guy
doing
pretty
good
with
me
in
is
ted
and
nice
guy
mean
everything
say
he
agrees
with
me
no
matter
what
say
was
going
to
do
one
really
wild
but
he
agrees
but
with
the
ethanol
really
got
to
come
long
way
because
right
now
for
the
oil
but
understand
it
oil
pays
him
lot
of
money
got
to
be
for
oil
right
the
oil
companies
give
him
lot
of
money
but
with
you
with
everybody
look
self
funding
have
no
oil
company
have
no
special
interest
have
no
lobbyist
that
want
me
and
you
know
representing
countries
that
are
ripping
off
the
country
representing
companies
that
are
ripping
off
our
country
all
do
is
going
to
be
working
for
you
folks
going
to
do
this
thing
together
going
to
make
america
so
great
again
and
maybe
better
than
ever
before
so
important
so
when
we
first
started
talked
about
china
how
ripping
us
and
japan
and
mexico
mexico
both
at
the
border
and
in
trade
taking
so
many
of
our
companies
moving
there
with
their
big
plant
ford
is
moving
there
with
big
plant
they
took
big
plant
away
from
great
state
they
took
it
away
at
the
last
moment
not
going
to
let
that
stuff
going
to
do
what
we
have
to
do
okay
but
talked
about
that
and
talk
about
it
lot
the
fact
is
that
about
weeks
ago
with
paris
speaking
little
bit
differently
now
believe
me
can
take
care
of
china
in
my
back
pocket
easy
for
me
what
do
and
we
have
all
the
cards
lot
of
people
know
you
know
these
politicians
they
understand
we
have
the
cards
you
know
with
china
our
people
pay
tax
they
pay
no
tax
not
supposed
to
be
that
way
they
call
it
tariff
because
it
sounds
better
but
take
care
of
that
take
care
of
all
of
that
what
happened
is
with
paris
different
mindset
and
when
the
polls
came
out
last
week
my
numbers
went
way
up
because
people
felt
more
secure
with
me
now
maybe
it
had
to
do
who
knows
why
who
knows
but
my
poll
numbers
went
up
and
do
you
ever
notice
whenever
something
that
do
proper
but
controversial
say
oh
now
gone
it
the
end
go
over
all
of
the
different
things
because
maybe
change
your
minds
but
say
it
over
and
then
come
in
sir
your
poll
number
went
up
points
this
week
said
they
did
because
have
to
do
right
have
to
do
right
and
you
know
what
if
make
it
make
it
have
good
life
we
all
hopefully
have
good
life
have
great
family
nice
people
wonderful
people
they
love
me
think
hope
think
but
have
great
family
and
built
great
business
such
spirit
such
spirit
no
matter
where
go
you
know
go
to
dallas
we
have
people
in
mobile
alabama
people
in
oklahoma
wherever
we
go
in
we
have
these
crowds
you
know
this
is
supposed
to
be
for
like
record
it
is
big
and
yet
it
feels
intimate
it
feels
good
so
changed
couple
of
weeks
ago
when
saw
paris
changed
and
big
big
part
of
what
doing
now
is
safety
and
security
and
smartness
and
smartness
sort
of
interesting
you
know
the
slogan
is
make
america
great
again
and
adding
make
america
great
again
and
safe
again
because
we
feel
safe
anymore
and
the
problem
we
have
now
that
never
had
to
this
extent
is
the
power
of
weaponry
the
power
the
tremendous
power
you
know
years
ago
would
have
said
not
go
said
go
there
anyway
and
said
it
strongly
go
going
to
the
middle
east
but
the
fact
is
right
now
going
to
have
to
do
things
because
we
have
some
really
really
sick
degenerates
and
the
press
look
at
all
those
cameras
going
all
live
all
you
know
nobody
else
has
cameras
like
this
they
can
make
times
they
make
nobody
cares
look
at
this
and
worry
they
never
pan
the
crowd
you
know
they
never
they
have
me
why
walking
around
figured
walk
around
maybe
get
the
crowd
they
never
pan
the
crowd
tell
them
pan
the
crowd
they
never
do
had
crowd
people
last
week
more
people
and
in
confined
space
they
had
people
outside
that
get
in
my
wife
says
darling
the
was
excellent
did
you
have
many
people
there
said
what
she
said
well
they
never
leave
your
face
they
keep
it
purposely
but
tell
you
the
cameras
may
be
little
screwed
up
where
you
move
them
right
but
every
time
protester
well
protesting
and
it
can
be
in
the
back
corner
of
the
room
the
cameras
swoop
over
there
true
true
true
no
used
to
think
they
move
you
know
maybe
something
with
the
crazy
computers
you
know
in
the
old
days
everything
was
better
right
the
car
seats
sit
in
your
car
and
you
want
to
move
forward
and
back
you
press
button
bing
bing
now
you
have
to
open
up
things
press
computer
takes
you
minutes
well
the
same
thing
figured
with
cameras
think
they
moved
figured
they
were
fixed
for
certain
reasons
and
then
saw
protester
and
those
cameras
were
bent
in
positions
like
you
believe
possible
so
very
dishonest
people
what
can
say
not
all
of
them
but
most
of
them
tell
you
you
have
one
of
the
most
dishonest
right
here
in
your
backyard
the
register
is
the
worst
they
are
the
worst
the
worst
no
very
dishonest
you
have
some
reporter
named
she
is
the
worst
she
will
write
so
such
misrepresentation
and
so
care
mean
who
cares
so
saying
it
right
in
their
backyard
failing
anyway
they
probably
be
in
business
in
two
years
think
losing
fortune
think
you
know
funny
every
time
the
register
does
poll
always
do
badly
only
doing
this
so
they
sue
me
but
mind
if
they
do
hope
they
sue
me
because
they
have
enough
money
to
sue
me
the
good
thing
but
believe
and
may
be
wrong
in
fact
say
sure
wrong
but
my
opinion
that
they
do
it
properly
because
you
know
they
poll
like
or
people
explain
it
you
know
if
they
lose
people
in
the
pocket
oh
trump
oh
forget
that
one
forget
that
one
now
know
that
they
do
that
do
you
do
that
register
but
every
time
have
register
poll
do
poorly
also
do
poorly
with
the
polls
know
why
but
we
had
great
poll
come
in
last
couple
of
days
where
leading
think
by
points
in
in
and
then
we
have
another
coming
where
doing
well
but
think
register
has
somebody
says
coming
out
sometime
just
tell
you
watch
trump
disappears
think
going
to
do
so
well
think
actually
going
to
even
do
better
you
know
leading
in
most
of
the
poll
leading
in
every
poll
except
there
was
one
poll
there
was
one
poll
never
even
heard
what
the
hell
is
what
is
explain
it
like
you
know
why
like
it
because
they
always
treat
me
badly
also
but
only
like
polls
that
treat
me
well
but
doing
so
well
nationwide
leading
every
poll
by
tremendous
we
just
had
one
in
georgia
think
of
that
with
people
take
if
we
had
three
people
think
take
it
if
we
had
two
people
but
think
take
if
we
had
three
but
came
out
as
you
know
you
probably
saw
that
new
york
times
two
days
ago
and
at
to
small
number
killing
everybody
in
every
poll
just
one
little
outlier
here
again
sure
when
comes
out
be
negative
because
believe
that
poll
but
we
are
going
to
win
and
tell
you
what
honestly
is
so
important
to
me
could
say
oh
not
do
am
an
evangelical
am
christian
love
billy
graham
graham
came
out
with
the
most
beautiful
statements
graham
he
was
so
incredible
he
came
out
know
if
you
all
saw
the
statements
he
came
out
with
about
trump
he
was
so
incredible
graham
was
amazing
the
son
of
billy
graham
who
was
you
know
nobody
nobody
that
ever
seen
billy
graham
was
unbelievable
if
gone
to
his
crusades
they
were
incredible
but
so
think
going
to
do
doing
really
well
with
the
evangelicals
and
by
the
way
and
again
do
like
ted
but
not
lot
of
evangelicals
come
out
of
cuba
in
all
fairness
true
not
lot
come
out
but
like
him
nevertheless
think
going
to
do
great
and
we
are
doing
great
with
evangelicals
doing
great
with
the
tea
party
leading
with
the
tea
party
and
doing
fantastic
with
all
the
young
and
middle
doing
great
with
everybody
and
so
very
important
for
me
to
win
now
could
put
less
pressure
on
myself
and
could
say
oh
care
about
care
but
do
care
do
care
so
much
about
it
why
here
all
the
time
and
then
the
lies
happened
you
know
when
was
using
they
lied
so
much
said
the
people
of
be
that
stupid
or
the
people
of
the
country
trying
to
make
point
right
so
said
the
people
of
the
country
be
that
stupid
well
they
cut
the
country
out
so
referring
to
love
you
people
remember
that
remember
that
was
talking
about
something
and
even
mention
what
talking
about
because
the
guy
talking
about
and
was
actually
very
good
guy
but
will
say
this
we
want
to
win
so
bad
because
if
win
think
run
the
table
really
do
think
run
the
table
go
right
through
because
leading
big
in
new
every
poll
big
big
in
new
got
an
endorsement
from
this
crazy
newspaper
up
there
the
weirdest
deal
ever
seen
and
you
know
the
paper
that
was
in
his
state
called
up
and
said
are
you
sure
about
that
nobody
ever
called
us
they
believe
it
and
we
can
get
into
that
but
irrelevant
but
leading
new
big
leading
in
south
like
monstrous
numbers
leading
leading
in
texas
leading
everywhere
leading
big
in
florida
now
you
have
nice
guy
by
the
way
you
have
and
he
is
nice
guy
but
got
to
vote
when
people
put
you
in
position
to
be
senator
got
to
go
and
vote
you
be
the
number
one
person
that
vote
in
the
senate
got
to
say
hey
young
guy
want
to
go
and
vote
you
should
stay
there
little
longer
good
guy
stay
there
go
in
vote
create
nice
record
but
know
he
doing
in
not
too
good
right
not
doing
well
doing
not
good
mean
it
seems
like
race
right
now
and
an
important
race
to
me
so
just
want
to
let
you
know
very
important
so
with
all
of
that
if
we
win
lot
of
people
say
just
go
through
think
win
virtually
every
state
in
the
union
and
over
quickly
over
quickly
what
about
the
republican
establishment
the
got
problem
you
know
sort
of
like
the
fighters
you
know
the
great
champions
sometimes
go
into
the
of
guy
fighting
and
say
you
know
never
want
to
get
decision
we
go
for
the
the
is
the
because
you
get
lot
of
bad
decisions
know
lot
about
the
world
of
sports
believe
me
and
they
go
into
to
fight
and
decision
and
they
say
in
problem
and
lose
the
fight
that
they
won
the
only
way
they
win
the
fight
definitely
knock
out
so
if
we
win
think
going
to
win
everything
after
that
so
think
going
to
show
how
important
is
pledge
this
to
even
if
lose
pledge
it
okay
think
ever
said
that
in
my
life
if
we
go
and
win
staying
right
where
it
is
in
the
chain
not
moving
you
know
big
move
to
move
into
much
further
back
position
by
the
establishment
folks
win
not
happening
okay
staying
right
here
because
great
great
been
paying
into
social
security
and
by
the
way
put
them
in
because
does
work
with
both
you
have
tremendous
waste
fraud
and
abuse
going
to
take
care
of
that
okay
but
not
going
to
cut
your
social
security
and
not
cutting
your
going
to
take
jobs
back
from
all
these
countries
that
are
ripping
us
off
going
to
become
wealthy
country
again
and
going
to
be
able
to
save
your
social
security
believe
this
number
but
read
it
over
who
is
the
man
that
told
me
the
number
over
million
people
believe
it
are
aged
and
over
are
getting
social
security
but
heard
it
read
it
tremendous
like
million
people
are
getting
social
security
dead
meaning
somebody
else
is
picking
up
the
press
is
going
to
have
to
check
it
because
what
do
know
but
can
you
imagine
we
have
million
now
we
know
not
million
there
may
be
one
but
not
million
anybody
in
this
room
or
over
because
if
they
are
want
to
shake
your
hand
but
so
million
over
years
old
picking
up
social
security
and
the
beginning
so
tremendous
waste
fraud
and
abuse
what
going
to
do
is
going
to
save
going
to
save
social
security
not
going
to
raise
the
age
or
not
going
to
do
all
the
things
that
everyone
else
is
talking
about
doing
all
talking
about
doing
it
and
you
have
to
going
to
bring
our
jobs
back
going
to
make
our
economy
incredible
again
my
tax
proposal
which
is
in
and
great
detail
in
terms
of
policy
and
gotten
tremendous
reviews
from
lot
of
people
lot
of
great
groups
but
we
are
going
to
cut
taxes
tremendously
for
the
middle
class
and
for
businesses
because
our
middle
class
is
being
decimated
and
when
that
happens
going
to
see
an
economy
that
takes
off
going
to
get
rid
of
lot
of
that
debt
if
not
all
of
it
but
going
to
get
rid
of
it
you
know
at
trillion
going
trillion
right
you
know
if
you
go
back
eight
or
nine
years
trillion
even
word
anybody
knew
and
now
like
routine
so
we
are
going
to
save
your
social
security
without
cuts
going
to
bring
the
economy
back
going
to
make
ourselves
rich
again

crude

to
make
our
country

know
crude
it
sounds
bad
but
many
things
say
are
crude
it
sounds
bad
but
we
make
our
country
great
again
unless
we
make
our
country
rich
again

let
everybody

the
world
rip
us

but
they
have
bridges
going
up
we
have
rebuilt
china
taken
our
jobs
taken
our
base
taken
our
manufacturing
all
over
the
place
taken
our
money

going
to

going
to
happen
anymore
not
going
to
happen

the
great
business

have
the
greatest
business
people
in
the
world
guys
like
he
calls
me
want
to
help
want
to
help
the
smartest
people
call
not
going
to
use
the
special
interest
guy
donor
we
use
donors
to
negotiate
with
china
because
he
gave
some
guy
like
you
know
whoever
it
might
be
because
again
the
only
one
my
campaign
everybody
else
these
guys
when
these
guys
give
money
to
politicians
to
large
extent
they
own
those
politicians
they
will
do
whatever
the
hell
the
special
interests
and
the
donors
want
not
going
to
happen
with
me
so
social
security
saving
it
saving
it
going
to
make
our
country
rich
okay
thank
you
sweetheart
yeah
called
the
statute
of
limitations
right
and
you
know
year
statute
maybe
five
but
probably
six
but
statute
yeah
you
have
to
look
at
it
look
you
know
this
story
crime
she
committed
crime
now
perhaps
perhaps
somebody
you
know
we
have
to
have
fair
justice
department
and
perhaps
have
some
really
good
attorney
general
going
to
say
well
you
know
look
we
want
to
be
fair
to
everybody
okay
including
but
she
committed
crime
in
my
opinion
now
she
be
allowed
to
run
being
protected
absolutely
have
little
doubt
that
going
to
find
anything
but
already
found
it
mean
you
watch
television
you
have
all
these
big
scholars
these
lawyers
yes
she
violated
section
so
and
so
just
one
after
another
mean
actually
violated
many
many
laws
not
just
like
little
one
here
many
laws
you
mentioned
general
his
life
was
destroyed
over
of
what
did
over
nothing
so
think
going
to
be
their
nominee
definitely
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
be
allowed
to
run
being
protected
by
the
democrats
being
protected
by
the
president
and
why
why
do
you
think
going
along
with
these
insane
policies
of
his
okay
mean
she
goes
along
with
everything
even
honestly
in
all
fairness
to
her
think
she
believes
it
but
think
afraid
going
to
say
listen
like
her
anymore
go
take
care
of
her
going
to
get
somebody
else
telling
you
so
the
question
is
statute
of
limitations
five
year
statute
of
limitations
got
problem
got
problem
in
one
way
running
for
her
life
because
know
one
thing
if
she
wins
the
end
of
that
right
but
if
she
loses
she
could
have
very
serious
problem
well
said
right
at
the
beginning
going
to
build
wall
going
to
be
real
wall
going
to
be
real
wall
not
going
to
be
you
see
that
ceiling
that
ceiling
is
nothing
compared
to
the
wall
and
we
can
build
it
and
we
can
build
it
right
and
it
will
be
strong
and
powerful
and
as
beautiful
as
wall
is
going
to
look
got
to
be
beautiful
because
someday
going
to
name
it
the
trump
wall
know
that
going
to
happen
going
to
happen
and
going
to
work
and
walls
do
work
you
know
they
wanted
to
build
wall
here
years
ago
you
know
they
get
environmental
impact
statements
just
shows
you
china
is
building
in
the
south
china
sea
massive
military
bases
right
why
not
supposed
to
they
have
no
respect
for
or
our
country
not
supposed
to
be
doing
that
and
you
could
get
them
to
stop
just
by
saying
not
doing
business
with
you
anymore
their
whole
economy
would
you
have
to
go
to
war
economics
the
whole
country
would
collapse
in
two
seconds
believe
me
we
have
such
power
and
we
know
it
but
building
massive
now
they
had
little
islands
they
put
the
biggest
not
caterpillars
think
using
from
japan
they
have
these
massive
and
said
to
friend
of
mine
chinese
from
china
very
rich
guy
very
successful
guy
paid
me
fortune
for
an
apartment
so
happen
to
like
him
okay
said
jokingly
how
long
did
it
take
them
to
do
these
massive
islands
building
right
out
of
the
sea
boom
those
shovels
go
in
take
out
everything
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
get
the
environmental
impact
statements
he
laughed
he
said
what
are
you
kidding
me
nothing
they
say
we
will
build
there
about
two
seconds
later
you
have
digging
so
we
had
problem
with
environmental
look
won
many
environmental
awards
big
believer
especially
in
clean
air
and
clean
water
big
believer
just
so
you
know
big
and
gotten
so
many
awards
for
the
environment
so
understand
the
environment
won
many
many
awards
but
when
you
look
at
how
impinged
and
hurt
but
the
wall
was
stopped
because
they
get
an
environmental
impact
statement
among
other
things
they
get
an
environmental
impact
statement
now
there
was
probably
snail
or
turtle
or
snake
or
something
you
were
ruining
the
habitat
of
rattlesnake
know
but
they
actually
had
people
lot
of
people
people
that
now
would
be
against
it
but
they
wanted
to
build
wall
and
years
ago
they
get
it
done
you
know
said
bomb
the
oil
right
been
saying
that
for
three
years
now
finally
they
started
after
paris
they
started
bombing
the
oil
been
saying
it
for
years
you
know
one
of
the
reasons
we
bomb
the
oil
want
to
hurt
the
environment
now
heard
that
and
thought
somebody
was
kidding
thought
comedian
was
saying
it
it
turned
out
to
be
true
he
want
the
flames
and
everything
going
into
the
atmosphere
this
is
the
way
we
fight
today
telling
you
folks
being
led
by
stupid
people
being
led
by
stupid
people
been
saying
not
really
bomb
been
saying
take
the
oil
want
to
go
into
iraq
but
once
we
were
there
said
look
we
have
been
there
but
then
when
we
left
we
left
the
wrong
way
first
of
all
we
have
president
who
told
them
date
going
to
leave
on
such
and
such
date
what
was
it
like
months
later
so
the
enemy
all
of
sudden
said
wow
believe
it
they
want
to
be
killed
okay
they
want
to
be
killed
so
the
enemy
said
going
to
leave
on
certain
date
so
they
pulled
back
the
date
comes
and
now
you
see
what
happened
disaster
and
iran
is
taking
over
iraq
so
anyway
believe
it
when
they
said
that
when
we
said
to
our
soldiers
two
weeks
ago
and
our
president
gets
up
and
announces
we
are
sending
soldiers
okay
first
of
all
he
thinks
good
press
announcement
not
soldiers
not
lot
even
though
the
elite
but
those
soldiers
because
of
that
announcement
have
target
on
their
heart
they
have
target
on
their
heart
why
does
he
have
to
say
that
for
why
he
let
soldiers
go
there
quietly
stealth
stealth
why
he
just
do
that
why
he
do
that
those
soldiers
are
in
grave
danger
today
because
of
that
and
they
probably
even
know
that
but
everybody
is
looking
for
them
and
the
way
it
is
we
have
people
that
know
what
doing
we
used
to
have
general
general
george
mean
these
were
real
people
these
were
real
people
today
we
have
generals
that
go
on
talk
shows
saw
general
the
other
day
on
talk
show
he
said
and
this
was
serious
and
good
man
good
men
but
got
to
lead
these
men
even
the
generals
have
to
have
some
power
over
them
he
said
we
are
in
the
worst
shape
in
terms
of
preparedness
that
been
in
in
decades
and
this
is
the
time
when
we
have
to
be
in
the
best
shape
because
the
world
wants
to
kill
us
and
he
said
we
are
in
the
worst
shape
been
in
many
many
decades
now
number
one
he
be
saying
that
because
telling
the
enemy
that
and
the
enemy
feels
embolden
when
they
hear
that
right
we
be
saying
it
we
be
saying
it
mean
even
if
true
you
say
it
you
get
it
fixed
and
you
do
the
opposite
one
thing
going
to
do
tell
you
going
to
build
our
military
so
big
and
so
strong
and
so
powerful
so
powerful
that
nobody
is
going
to
mess
with
us
nobody
is
going
to
mess
with
us
you
know
in
many
ways
the
cheapest
thing
you
can
do
everyone
is
toying
with
us
right
now
the
cheapest
thing
you
can
do
the
absolute
cheapest
thing
you
can
do
big
second
amendment
person
by
the
way
my
sons
are
really
great
marksmen
big
believers
and
member
of
the
but
not
such
good
shot
but
great
shots
so
one
of
those
things
but
if
you
think
about
that
question
so
you
know
tremendous
pressure
to
get
rid
of
the
guns
get
rid
of
the
magazines
no
bullets
how
about
the
one
where
they
have
three
bullets
in
every
magazine
so
the
people
will
put
three
bullets
in
think
the
bad
guys
are
going
to
say
well
want
to
break
the
law
going
to
go
kill
people
today
but
going
to
put
three
bullets
in
right
these
people
and
you
know
have
arguments
with
them
all
the
time
and
practical
guy
honestly
if
believe
this
say
it
so
in
france
or
in
california
have
permission
to
carry
which
is
big
thing
in
new
york
very
hard
to
get
have
license
to
carry
but
in
france
or
in
california
or
in
all
these
places
where
we
see
the
shooters
right
if
instead
of
having
like
in
france
hundreds
of
people
in
that
room
paris
has
the
toughest
gun
laws
in
the
world
france
has
the
toughest
gun
laws
in
the
world
nobody
has
guns
except
the
bad
guys
so
they
walk
in
with
the
worst
the
toughest
the
best
weaponry
you
could
have
and
they
said
over
here
boom
over
here
boom
so
they
killed
but
many
more
are
dying
right
now
in
terrible
shape
in
the
hospitals
they
just
wipe
the
place
out
and
they
stayed
there
for
longer
they
wiped
it
out
then
you
had
those
two
sleaze
bags
from
california
the
married
couple
saw
the
press
the
young
married
couple
that
did
the
shooting
not
young
married
couple
the
worst
sleaze
they
say
the
young
married
couple
no
young
married
couple
so
they
walk
into
place
and
they
killed
people
and
others
are
going
to
be
dying
probably
because
of
lot
of
other
wounded
people
but
if
somebody
had
guns
in
there
nobody
had
gun
how
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
gun
would
you
have
been
firing
back
little
bit
been
in
trouble
right
they
would
have
been
in
trouble
believe
me
that
guy
so
you
know
went
to
like
an
ivy
league
college
and
have
lot
of
friends
that
are
against
guns
and
argue
with
them
talk
to
them
said
okay
in
paris
you
have
all
these
places
and
hundreds
of
people
guys
walk
in
with
guns
and
you
have
no
gun
you
think
they
been
better
if
they
had
they
they
lose
the
argument
but
they
never
change
their
mind
so
we
have
to
fight
for
the
second
amendment
so
simple
so
simple
and
believe
me
believe
me
they
want
to
take
those
guns
away
and
you
always
know
that
the
bad
ones
are
going
to
have
the
guns
and
going
to
have
them
more
so
than
ever
before
so
going
to
protect
the
second
amendment
if
president
that
can
tell
you
and
by
the
way
going
to
be
saying
merry
again
do
you
ever
notice
and
by
the
way
merry
everybody
merry
and
happy
holiday
frankly
have
lot
of
friends
that
christian
they
like
everybody
likes
politically
incorrect
to
say
merry
but
when
president
merry
happy
holidays
enjoy
yourselves
eat
too
much
turkey
right
okay
so
going
to
say
merry
again
folks
going
to
bring
that
spirit
back
really
do
like
ted
lot
and
doing
well
doing
well
mean
not
contest
between
the
two
of
us
just
so
we
understand
we
have
to
make
that
but
do
like
him
and
would
say
that
we
would
certainly
have
things
in
mind
for
ted
to
be
honest
with
you
mean
somebody
that
can
certainly
see
that
because
like
him
he
likes
me
he
actually
put
out
tweet
tonight
he
said
trump
is
think
he
used
the
word
terrific
nice
word
mean
whoever
hears
that
can
tell
you
other
candidates
are
not
exactly
saying
that
about
me
right
so
the
super
are
horrible
and
had
many
set
up
for
me
by
people
know
mean
see
them
on
television
talking
about
somebody
named
one
the
art
of
the
deal
two
young
guys
they
look
good
mean
know
but
then
got
to
be
you
know
started
going
around
and
see
the
corruption
with
these
super
with
the
stuff
towards
money
people
that
put
the
money
in
are
dealing
with
the
candidates
the
whole
thing
is
wrong
and
see
it
mean
bush
has
million
think
of
it
million
by
the
way
if
he
had
billion
it
make
any
difference
okay
but
bush
has
million
and
honestly
nice
person
he
is
want
to
do
that
but
very
nice
person
but
million
and
say
to
yourself
people
give
million
million
million
you
know
happening
but
some
of
the
super
are
running
campaigns
actually
running
the
campaign
another
thing
and
sort
of
interesting
one
of
the
super
believe
has
million
of
the
million
this
was
reported
on
the
front
page
of
the
times
one
of
the
candidates
nice
person
so
not
going
to
mention
the
name
you
know
when
like
people
like
them
very
loyal
person
of
the
million
after
all
of
the
bloodsuckers
took
their
cuts
the
fundraisers
can
you
believe
this
they
had
left
for
the
campaign
better
than
being
real
estate
broker
rather
do
that
than
sell
houses
left
that
was
in
the
newspaper
know
think
believe
it
but
seen
it
saw
it
with
the
campaign
guys
made
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
raising
money
for
said
what
the
hell
is
this
mean
you
give
money
and
they
get
cut
look
our
laws
are
so
corrupt
our
campaign
finance
laws
are
so
totally
corrupt
so
horrible
so
horrible
and
necessarily
want
to
stop
people
from
giving
because
think
good
thing
but
you
have
to
get
away
from
these
what
you
have
to
have
is
people
have
to
know
who
it
is
so
you
have
to
open
up
the
process
let
people
know
if
somebody
wants
to
give
million
you
give
million
but
everybody
has
to
know
that
so
and
so
gave
million
because
that
puts
little
pressure
on
guys
like
who
raises
hundreds
of
millions
puts
little
pressure
but
the
concept
of
the
is
no
good
no
good
very
dangerous
terrible
thing
so
we
will
change
our
laws
because
you
really
have
no
choice
so
out
of
control
so
terrible
but
the
papers
that
are
in
this
room
tonight
they
should
look
at
this
so
little
money
left
over
for
the
candidates
one
of
the
reasons
why
so
happy
doing
my
own
we
actually
sent
legal
letters
to
either
nine
or
the
trump
the
trump
the
this
first
of
all
sure
that
out
of
some
of
them
they
stole
the
money
some
guy
has
no
money
he
sets
up
trump
something
nothing
to
do
with
me
sets
it
up
all
of
sudden
got
million
sitting
there
right
people
send
in
money
and
that
guy
has
no
money
how
much
of
that
money
do
you
think
going
to
use
to
do
what
supposed
to
be
doing
common
sense
so
maybe
all
of
it
but
doubt
it
so
we
sent
legal
notices
to
every
one
that
we
could
find
we
want
their
money
we
said
do
it
we
want
it
and
we
want
ideally
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
people
that
gave
it
to
you
but
the
super
concept
is
corrupt
terrible
and
it
should
be
ended
and
going
to
go
to
new
campaign
finance
laws
that
are
going
to
be
terrific
okay
thank
you
well
look
referring
to
from
texas
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
lot
of
oil
in
texas
right
so
you
know
he
gets
lot
of
money
from
the
oil
companies
and
totally
against
ethanol
and
everything
else
talking
about
and
not
totally
in
and
you
know
big
industry
here
big
industry
you
know
if
that
industry
is
upset
got
problems
was
amazed
was
here
three
weeks
ago
with
the
group
they
were
such
amazing
people
and
learned
so
much
about
it
was
in
of
it
even
before
beyond
even
the
fuel
capacities
which
we
want
to
create
as
much
as
we
can
tremendous
numbers
of
jobs
in
and
said
to
myself
if
ted
is
against
ethanol
how
does
he
win
in
because
very
know
how
he
wins
in
know
no
but
totally
for
it
okay
thank
you
was
member
of
the
establishment
six
months
ago
gave
to
the
the
republican
governors
association
gave
tremendous
amounts
of
money
away
was
like
the
fair
haired
boy
once
said
running
they
said
what
not
supposed
to
run
and
then
what
happened
ran
against
all
these
senators
and
governors
and
everyone
said
well
know
my
wife
said
if
you
run
going
to
win
because
she
understands
that
like
people
love
people
and
people
love
me
and
she
said
you
will
run
but
you
actually
have
to
go
and
run
you
have
to
announce
running
because
going
to
believe
running
and
so
want
to
announce
because
want
to
like
announce
and
things
work
out
and
like
some
of
these
guys
where
zero
many
of
them
zero
and
so
finally
said
look
going
to
do
it
we
have
to
do
it
just
too
many
things
that
watch
on
television
with
our
president
and
the
decisions
that
are
made
where
we
get
and
they
get
five
killers
we
get
this
horrible
dirty
rotten
spy
horrible
traitor
we
get
this
horrible
terrible
traitor
and
they
get
five
killers
that
wanted
for
nine
years
the
worst
killers
and
all
back
on
the
battlefield
you
know
so
many
decisions
the
iran
deal
the
iran
deal
how
bad
is
that
they
okay
good
not
building
we
promise
not
building
nuclear
weapons
oh
okay
okay
and
we
give
them
billion
and
we
even
get
our
prisoners
back
the
whole
thing
is
crazy
so
saw
this
and
said
to
my
wife
hey
know
if
do
well
or
not
who
the
hell
knows
and
risky
thing
and
always
heard
if
very
successful
person
you
run
for
office
especially
for
president
and
see
it
all
the
time
and
the
people
go
after
me
even
care
at
this
point
said
have
to
do
it
now
going
to
have
to
do
it
and
look
at
it
last
time
with
and
do
it
and
probably
should
have
because
he
let
us
down
mean
look
he
let
us
down
that
was
an
election
we
had
failed
president
four
years
ago
he
was
failed
president
just
as
bad
as
he
is
now
true
and
let
us
down
that
last
month
it
was
like
he
even
campaigning
said
why
you
on
jay
why
you
on
david
why

doing
it
and
he
just
do
it
so
he
lost
the
election
so
backed
he
lost
backed
he
lost
this
time
said
doing
it
myself
okay
going
to
win
going
to
win
but
there
is
an
establishment
out
there
real
establishment
real
people
and
people
that
are
used
to
having
their
little
puppets
all
over
the
place
and
people
that
are
used
to
giving
donations
and
having
control
and
people
that
you
know
look
when
they
call
me
treat
them
with
respect
but
not
going
to
be
doing
bad
things
if
bad
for
the
country
not
going
to
let
ford
build
plant
in
mexico
if
can
keep
it
in
michigan
and
not
going
to
let
the
car
companies
and
and
all
these
people
and
all
these
companies
all
for
free
trade
think
great
for
it
but
got
to
be
smart
trade
not
going
to
let
them
move
to
mexico
and
then
sell
stuff
over
the
border
with
no
tax
no
nothing
so
we
lose
our
jobs
we
lose
our
factories
they
go
over
here
they
make
it
we
let
them
come
through
how
does
that
help
us
folks
went
to
the
best
business
school
in
the
world
believe
me
it
help
us
okay
trust
me
and
not
going
to
make
deals
like
that
anymore
we
we
owe
trillion
we
so
the
establishment
is
not
ever
probably
look
you
know
what
in
the
end
if
this
country
starts
humming
even
the
establishment
be
saying
okay
good
thing
because
be
beneficiaries
also
but
we
do
have
real
establishment
and
never
seen
this
happen
before
writer
called
up
and
he
said
recently
told
this
story
mean
one
of
the
top
journalists
to
my
way
of
thinking
certainly
in
the
country
and
beyond
and
he
said
trump
how
does
it
feel
said
how
does
what
feel
how
does
it
feel
what
done
has
never
ever
been
done
before
said
what
have
done
dominated
the
summer
of
trump
now
they
call
it
the
autumn
of
trump
hopefully
going
to
call
it
the
spring
of
trump
and
want
the
next
autumn
of
trump
but
said
to
the
writer
know
what
talking
about
done
anything
frankly
if
win
consider
this
to
be
total
waste
of
time
be
honest
with
you
as
much
as
like
being
with
you
tonight
because
we
be
able
to
do
anything
he
said
no
no
won
even
if
you
win
won
already
said
no
wrong
if
win
have
wasted
my
time
so
you
know
the
point
is
that
the
establishment
believe
it
because
never
seen
it
happen
before
was
on
the
cover
of
time
magazine
four
or
five
weeks
ago
and
time
magazine
was
going
to
pick
the
person
of
the
year
everybody
even
my
enemies
said
trump
is
going
to
win
said
win
they
said
why
win
just
like
should
have
gotten
the
for
the
apprentice
for
the
first
three
years
was
nominated
should
have
and
said
never
win
told
everybody
never
win
because
not
establishment
and
with
time
magazine
said
bill
great
guy
did
an
editorial
at
the
end
of
his
show
two
days
ago
saying
nobody
has
done
more
than
trump
he
should
have
won
now
not
saying
should
have
yeah
probably
should
have
in
all
fairness
but
he
said
done
more
you
know
taking
over
what
done
has
been
amazing
all
of
us
together
not
just
me
all
of
us
all
of
us
from
dallas
and
mobile
and
oklahoma
all
of
us
because
the
spirit
well
got
it
now
what
did
she
do
destroyed
mean
in
the
process
of
destroying
germany
with
the
migration
we
have
to
help
the
people
with
the
migration
we
have
to
create
safe
zone
some
place
in
syria
but
want
them
coming
into
this
country
want
them
because
we
know
who
they
are
we
know
who
they
are
them
with
their
printing
press
that
now
do
the
forged
passports
okay
you
heard
about
that
so
we
know
the
bottom
line
on
that
such
an
interesting
question
know
in
about
month
or
two
whether
or
not
the
establishment
has
treated
me
fairly
but
the
only
thing
can
say
is
this
if
win
think
over
said
before
because
think
if
win
new
is
amazing
people
are
amazing
you
would
love
the
people
they
would
love
you
love
everybody
the
whole
country
is
in
love
call
it
the
noisy
majority
no
longer
silent
majority
the
noisy
majority
but
if
we
win
like
think
going
to
win
because
we
have
such
big
league
honestly
not
going
to
matter
they
do
anything
care
about
the
establishment
they
do
anything
you
know
the
only
way
they
can
do
is
if
little
bit
short
if
two
votes
short
have
problem
because
have
to
go
into
that
convention
dealing
with
all
these
blood
sucker
politicians
and
make
their
deals
and
have
all
their
money
guys
around
and
be
in
the
making
deals
but
if
get
the
number
of
delegates
not
thing
they
can
do
and
end
up
doing
fine
with
the
establishment
such
believer
in
education
you
know
had
an
uncle
who
was
professor
at
who
was
brilliant
guy
in
fact
just
an
article
about
him
today
got
to
read
it
okay
you
have
to
read
it
when
see
somebody
like
no
tell
you
one
thing
respect
he
change
his
views
he
knew
he
was
getting
killed
on
this
issue
and
he
change
and
respect
that
to
certain
extent
but
so
wrong
common
core
is
total
disaster
we
have
people
bureaucrats
in
washington
telling
you
how
your
child
should
be
educated
in
and
new
and
all
of
the
different
places
that
we
go
to
ridiculous
and
go
around
and
seen
the
principals
seen
so
many
students
and
teachers
and
professors
and
principals
and
seen
some
of
the
people
and
the
love
even
in
at
school
seen
some
of
the
love
these
parents
give
to
those
schools
this
is
real
love
these
are
smart
people
and
these
are
people
that
working
for
these
are
incredible
people
remember
this
our
educational
system
is
mess
we
spend
more
money
per
pupil
as
government
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
and
in
place
and
mean
like
double
what
anybody
else
pays
so
want
to
bring
education
back
to
the
local
areas
going
to
have
parents
and
going
to
have
unbelievably
talented
people
and
they
love
their
kids
and
they
want
their
kids
to
be
because
so
important
and
going
to
be
very
happy
with
it
okay
thank
you
thank
you
you
people
do
it
backing
you
we
are
backing
you
doing
phenomenal
job
there
should
be
more
people
like
you
in
this
country
you
know
the
whole
grid
is
disaster
right
the
whole
country
the
infrastructure
of
our
country
is
falling
apart
and
nobody
can
build
like
me
what
do
build
build
building
on
as
you
know
avenue
big
tremendous
hotel
that
got
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
can
you
believe
it
during
the
administration
couple
of
years
ago
but
we
had
the
best
plan
the
is
terrific
very
good
actually
very
talented
people
and
ahead
of
schedule
what
we
do
when
you
see
these
things
where
building
bridge
and
going
to
cost
you
know
billion
and
it
costs
billion
how
about
when
they
build
hospital
and
it
costs
billion
and
look
at
it
very
good

tell
you
how
much
going
to
cost
say

sad
to
see
happening

going
to
change
it
around
we
have
such
problem
and
the
biggest
problem
have
you
know
it
relates
to
education
and
the
hardest
thing
you
get
is
when
you
go
around
and
see
students
and
so
many
students
come
out
to
hear
us
and
they
always
want
to
talk
about
the
loans
they
have
student
loans
and
going
through
nice
colleges
good
students
they
work
hard
they
could
be
really
top
in
their
class

get
out

proud
of

will
work
very
hard
to
earn
that
support
to
all
of
those
voters
who

been
left
out
in
the
cold
by
rigged
system
of
super
delegates
we
welcome
you
with
open
arms
and
by
the
way
the
terrible
trade
deals
that
was
so
vehemently
against
and
right
on
that
will
be
taken
care
of
far
better
than
anyone
ever
thought
possible
and
what
do
we
are
going
to
have
fantastic
trade
deals
going
to
start
making
money
and
bringing
in
jobs
now
know
some
people
say
too
much
of
fighter
my
preference
is
always
peace
however
and
shown
that
shown
that
for
long
time
built
an
extraordinary
business
on
relationships
and
deals
that
benefit
all
parties
involved
always
my
goal
is
always
again
to
bring
people

but
forced
to
fight

back
down
and
our
country
will
never
ever
back
down
fought
for
my
family
fought
for
my
business
fought
for
my
employees
and
now
going
to
fight
for
you
the
american
people
like
nobody
has
ever
fought
before
and
not
politician
fighting
me
going
to
see
some
real
good
things
happen
just
remember
this
going
to
be
your
champion
going
to
be
champion
because
you
see
this
election
about
republican
or
democrat
about
who
runs
this
country
the
special
interests
or
the
people
and
mean
the
american
people
every
election
year
politicians
promised
change
promised
change
and
it
work
out
too
well
and
every
year
they
failed
to
deliver
why
would
politicians
want
to
change
system
totally
rigged
in
order
to
keep
them
in
power
what
doing
folks
why
would
politicians
want
to
change
system
made
them
and
their
friends
very
very
wealthy
beat
rigged
system
by
winning
with
overwhelming
support
the
only
way
you
could
have
done
it
landslides
all
over
the
country
with
every
demographic
on
track
to
win
victories
in
field
that
began
with
very
talented
people
after
years
of
disappointment
one
thing
we
all
have
learned
we
fix
the
rigged
system
by
relying
on
very
and
mean
this
so
so
strongly
on
the
very
people
who
rigged
it
and
they
rigged
it
and
do
not
ever
think
anything
differently
we
solve
our
problems
by
counting
on
the
politicians
who
created
our
problems
the
have
turned
the
politics
of
personal
enrichment
into
an
art
form
for
themselves
made
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
selling
access
selling
selling
government
contracts
and
mean
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
secretary
even
did
all
of
the
work
on
totally
illegal
private
server
something
that
how
getting
away
with
this
folks
nobody
understands
designed
to
keep
her
corrupt
dealings
out
of
the
public
record
putting
the
security
of
the
entire
country
at
risk
and
president
in
corrupt
system
is
totally
protecting
her
not
right
am
going
to
give
major
on
probably
monday
of
next
week
and
going
to
be
discussing
all
of
the
things
that
have
taken
place
with
the
think
going
to
find
it
very
informative
and
very
very
interesting
wonder
if
the
press
would
want
to
attend
who
knows
turned
the
state
department
into
private
hedge
fund
the
the
saudis
the
chinese
all
gave
money
to
bill
and
and
got
treatment
in
return
sad
day
in
america
when
foreign
governments
with
deep
pockets
have
more
influence
in
our
own
country
than
our
great
citizens
need
to
do
this
not
easy
believe
me
need
to
do
it
but
felt
had
to
give
back
to
our
wonderful
country
which
has
been
so
good
to
me
and
to
my
family
to
many
of
our
states
and
seen
the
suffering
in
lives
visited
communities
in
new
york
new
jersey
indiana
and
ohio
whose
manufacturing
jobs
they
literally
these
jobs
have
virtually
disappeared
an
embarrassment
to
our
country
and
horrible
embraced
the
victims
of
illegal
immigration
moms
and
dads
who
have
had
to
bury
their
own
children
because
of
people
that
have
been
in
the
country
remember
it
folks
remember
it
visited
the
crumbling
cities
and
the
struggling
schools
seen
our
dilapidated
airports
highways
bridges
and
compared
them
to
other
countries
where
we
see
facilities
so
far
superior
to
ours
really
not
to
be
believed
hard
to
imagine
happened
to
our
country
america
is
getting
taken
apart
piece
by
piece
auctioned
off
and
just
rapidly
auctioned
off
to
the
highest
bidder
broke
broke
we
owe
trillion
going
quickly
to
trillion
our
infrastructure
is
disaster
our
schools
are
failing
crime
is
rising
people
are
scared
the
last
thing
we
need
is
in
the
white
house
or
an
extension
of
the
disaster
what
crowd
what
crowd
thank
you
all
very
much
we
love
our
country
we
love
our
country
but
we
can
turn
this
all
around
going
to
do
it
by
putting
america
first
that
commitment
is
the
foundation
for
change
been
missing
and
been
missing
for
long
time
important
to
understand
what
america
first
means
it
means
on
foreign
policy
we
will
never
enter
into
any
conflict
unless
it
makes
us
safer
as
nation
it
has
to
make
us
safer
as
nation
this
is
the
opposite
of
foreign
policy
which
invaded
libya
iraq
unleashed
isis
and
threw
syria
into
chaos
and
created
the
mass
migration
which
is
wrecking
havoc
all
over
the
world
and
while
putting
iran
on
the
path
to
nuclear
weapons
and
making
them
dominant
power
in
the
middle
east
and
they
are
dominant
and
we
have
made
them
that
way
folks
we
have
made
them
that
way
better
hope
president
on
trade
america
first
means
the
american
worker
will
have
his
or
her
job
protected
from
unfair
foreign
competition
happening
here
is
absolutely
disgrace
no
sic
right
about
that
so
and
you
mean
no
we
are
going
and
remember
this
we
are
only
going
to
have
great
trade
deals
okay
we
are
only
going
to
have
that
not
going
to
approve
as
somebody
just
said
the
partnership
which
is
disaster
disaster
for
our
country
almost
as
bad
as
signed
by
bill
which
has
just
stripped
our
country
of
our
factories
and
our
manufacturing
and
moved
them
to
other
places
and
in
particular
mexico
if
not
great
deal
for
our
country
we
will
not
sign
it
got
to
be
great
for
our
country
for
our
community
for
everybody
in
here
because
believe
me
we
are
all
suffering
and
suffering
big
league
and
getting
worse
on
energy
policy
america
first
means
opening
up
great
potential
to
bring
wealth
and
prosperity
to
our
own
workers
including
our
wonderful
and
hardworking
miners
who
have
been
absolutely
totally
mistreated
by
this
administration
on
economic
policy
america
first
means
having
tax
and
regulatory
policies
that
keep
jobs
and
wealth
in
the
united
states
substantially
lowering
taxes
for
middle
class
americans
and
businesses
likewise
regulation
which
is
strangling
our
economy
which
would
be
brought
down
from
its
present

remember
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
everybody
thank
you
very
much
this
has
been
great
period
of
time
been
really
amazing
gotten
the
nomination
going
to
have
an
incredible
period
in
we
look
forward
to
it
started
working
already
on
the
convention
and
good
luck
in
the
series
because
going
to
have
the
series
which
of
course
the
longer
it
goes
the
less
time
we
have
but
okay
and
going
to
be
very
interesting
to
see
what
happens
but
as
you
know
playing
the
basketball
championships
partially
in
that
arena
so
think
it
will
be
very
exciting
add
to
the
excitement
in
and
good
what
we
want
because
going
to
be
an
exciting
period
of
time
we
have
done
some
awfully
good
work
was
just
informed
that
got
more
votes
than
anybody
in
the
history
of
the
republican
primaries
and
we
still
have
guess
six
or
seven
locations
to
go
states
to
go
and
in
the
history
think
of
it
in
the
history
of
this
great
party
gotten
substantially
more
votes
than
anybody
else
by
millions
by
many
millions
more
than
anybody
ever
run
so
great
you
know
when
you
think
and
and
everybody
we
have
the
most
votes
by
far
so
something
to
me
very
exciting
and
overall
just
been
very
exciting
process
think
going
to
do
very
well
we
have
no
idea
going
to
happen
on
the
side
but
certainly
having
difficulty
like
to
see
people
having
difficulty
but
if
anybody
has
to
have
it
let
it
be
them
and
think
going
to
be
very
interesting
very
proud
to
say
that
gotten
the
most
votes
and
also
if
you
look
at
the
overall
primary
the
amount
of
votes
cast
also
record
so
broken
lot
of
records
in
terms
of
the
voters
our
polling
has
come
out
and
the
polls
are
doing
very
well
as
you
know
pretty
much
even
and
in
some
cases
ahead
of
and
think
going
to
have
very
very
successful
number
of
months
and
think
it
will
all
culminate
in
november
and
going
to
make
america
great
okay
so
the
way
it
is
glad
you
asked
the
question
because
have
to
tell
you
have
raised
tremendous
amount
of
money
for
the
vets
almost
million
and
more
money
is
going
to
come
in
believe
over
the
next
little
while
too
but
raised
almost
million
all
of
the
money
has
been
paid
out
and
going
to
give
it
to
you
in
just
second
in
fact
brought
list
just
in
case
that
question
was
asked
but
the
money
has
been
paid
out
have
been
thanked
by
so
many
groups
throughout
the
united
states
one
gentleman
called
me
up
recently
crying
that
out
of
blue
he
got
check
for
have
been
thanked
by
so
many
groups
great
groups
and
by
the
way
outside
you
have
few
people
picketing
sent
there
by
and
picketing
that
the
money
sent
the
money
has
all
been
sent
wanted
to
keep
it
private
if
we
could
wanted
to
keep
it
private
because
think
business
if
want
to
send
money
to
the
vets
but
have
to
say
this
raised
close
to
million
probably
be
over
that
amount
when
all
said
and
done
but
as
of
this
moment
million
when
this
started
it
started
with
in
when
said
raise
some
money
for
the
vets
and
it
went
up
from
million
to
million
to
million
and
it
now
ends
up
to
be
almost
million
and
again
think
we
can
even
do
better
than
that
but
will
say
that
the
press
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
and
behalf
of
the
vets
the
press
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
they
are
calling
me
they
are
furious
because
sent
people
checks
of
lot
of
money
going
to
give
you
the
names
right
now
which
is
what
you
want
and
instead
of
being
like
thank
you
very
much
trump
or
trump
did
good
job
everyone
said
who
got
it
who
got
it
who
got
it
and
you
make
me
look
very
bad
have
never
received
such
bad
publicity
for
doing
such
good
job
so
will
give
the
names
because
what
you
want
right
okay
are
you
ready
brought
them
here
it
takes
because
you
have
to
vet
each
company
you
know
much
of
this
money
was
paid
out
fairly
early
but
you
have
to
vet
all
of
these
different
groups
because
these
are
many
different
groups
you
have
to
go
through
process
when
you
send
checks
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
people
and
to
companies
and
to
groups
that
never
heard
of
charitable
you
have
to
vet
it
you
send
people
out
you
do
lot
of
work
now
most
of
the
money
went
out
quite
while
ago
some
of
it
went
out
more
recently
but
all
of
this
has
gone
out
and
give
you
the
names
are
you
ready
do
you
have
your
pad
and
again
really
think
the
press
look
the
media
you
know
my
opinion
of
the
media
very
low
think
the
media
is
frankly
made
up
of
people
that
in
many
cases
not
in
all
cases
are
not
good
people
but
think
this
is
an
example
and
just
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
folks
that
have
worked
hard
on
this
and
all
of
the
people
that
have
made
contributions
including
myself
gave
million
but
just
want
to
tell
you
that
there
are
so
many
people
that
are
so
thankful
for
what
we
did
one
other
thing
important
to
know
zero
dollars
have
been
taken
out
for
administration
you
know
when
you
go
to
lot
of
these
different
groups
in
this
case
zero
dollars
have
been
taken
out
for
administration
so
lot
of
these
companies
that
make
lot
of
money
doing
the
administration
stuff
so
no
money
it
costs
zero
dollars
to
accumulate
all
of
this
money
okay
so
you
have
kill
and
and
you
can
call
these
people
that
was
another
thing
lot
of
the
money
when
it
was
sent
out
different
people
would
call
could
tell
you
not
going
to
mention
anybody
specifically
but
there
were
couple
of
people
that
were
really
disgusting
call
and
these
vet
groups
they
get
lot
of
calls
from
the
press
and
maybe
some
of
them
would
keep
quiet
or
they
know
or
they
want
to
talk
to
the
press
or
they
feel
comfortable
so
if
they
say
they
got
the
money
which
they
all
did
got
the
money
all
certified
checks
if
anyone
wants
to
see
the
certified
checks
but
rather
than
say
why
you
could
see
certified
check
they
said
well
they
say
they
got
the
money
they
all
got
the
money
but
not
people
that
always
talk
to
the
press
many
of
them
do
talk
to
the
press
many
of
them
have
guess
you
found
million
or
million
where
they
talked
well
the
number
is
million
and
going
to
possibly
go
above
that
because
believe
some
other
people
are
coming
in
ready
got
now
these
are
checks
that
have
been
delivered
that
have
been
cashed
that
are
now
being
used
to
help
the
vets
international
great
much
of
this
money
was
paid
long
time
ago
american
hero
adventures
americans
for
equal
living
the
corps
just
so
you
understand
when
do
the
fox
debate
because
think
they
treated
me
right
but
actually
been
extremely
fair
over
the
last
three
or
four
months
have
to
say
that
about
fox
but
when
do
that
one
event
the
debate
gave
have
to
do
this
with
the
money
for
the
vets
but
decided
to
because
thought
it
would
be
good
idea
and
had
some
very
generous
people
gave
gave
million
gave
million
we
raised
lot
of
money
and
have
to
do
that
it
would
have
been
easier
just
to
give
the
and
the
problem
with
the
press
what
they
do
is
they
convince
people
like
me
not
to
do
it
not
to
give
money
to
different
things
because
lot
easier
actually
that
way
and
believe
going
to
have
some
more
coming
in
some
friends
of
mine
some
more
coming
in
and
that
adds
up
to
total
and
going
to
have
some
more
coming
in
now
every
one
of
those
checks
have
been
passed
other
than
the
one
check
which
is
being
held
subject
to
getting
final
approval
from
the
government
but
every
one
of
those
has
been
passed
this
is
my
check
for
million
we
have
many
letters
from
the
different
groups
thanking
us
very
much
for
the
money
and
they
ask
ask
people
to
be
here
today
could
have
asked
every
one
of
the
group
unlike
who
asks
people
to
stand
outside
and
say
trump
give
the
money
nobody
gave
this
kind
of
money
so
gave
more
is
coming
in
probably
tops
the
million
number
never
thought
we
were
going
to
raise
million
when
we
started
and
we
end
up
doing
almost
million
have
to
tell
you
the
press
is
so
dishonest
and
so
unfair
lot
of
the
people
behind
me
and
some
of
the
people
over
here
helped
in
vetting
the
various
requests
for
money
and
just
want
to
thank
all
of
those
people
too
involved
in
picking
the
other
than
to
the
marine
law
enforcement
they
are
fabulous
people
they
me
last
year
at
the
knew
them
was
going
to
give
it
to
three
companies
or
three
groups
and
we
vet
them
quickly
and
so
gave
it
to
the
marine
and
if
you
look
at
number
the
marine
corps
law
enforcement
foundation
is
fabulous
group
and
have
to
go
through
big
vetting
process
with
them
because
was
going
to
split
the
million
check
up
amongst
and
in
the
end
just
want
to
go
through
the
process
of
having
to
vet
all
those
different
groups
because
wanted
to
make
this
out
of
the
goodness
of
my
heart
want
to
do
this
where
the
press
is
all
involved
and
all
of
sudden
everybody
is
going
where
did
it
go
who
did
it
go
to
then
we
said
who
it
went
to
then
we
said
how
much
was
it
look
when
this
started
said
if
we
could
raise
million
that
would
be
good
and
we
ended
up
raising
almost
million
and
going
to
have
more
coming
in
over
period
of
time
totally
accountable
but
want
to
have
credit
for
it
actually
though
what
got
was
worse
than
credit
because
they
were
questioning
me
and
this
is
money
and
by
the
way
most
of
that
money
went
out
very
early
just
so
you
understand
but
lot
of
these
groups
getting
vetted
by
you
know
when
you
pay
the
money
out
they
need
government
documentation
they
need
lot
of
different
things
plus
we
want
to
find
out
in
the
good
group
had
people
teams
of
people
reviewing
statistics
reviewing
numbers
and
also
talking
to
people
in
the
military
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
group
was
deserving
of
the
money
we
have
given
to
groups
that
are
unbelievable
groups
and
honestly
wish
you
could
hear
the
phone
calls
and
see
the
letters
they
are
so
happy
and
happy
to
do
it
want
the
credit
for
it
but
it
was
very
unfair
that
the
press
treated
us
so
badly
well
generally
speaking
true
like
scrutiny
but
you
know
what
when
raise
money
excuse
me
excuse
me
watched
you
on
television
real
beauty
when
raise
money
for
the
veterans
and
massive
amount
of
money
find
out
how
much
has
given
to
the
veterans
nothing
and
then
see
few
guys
standing
out
there
they
even
know
what
there
for
they
have
no
idea
there
because
campaign
sent
them
and
actually
think
it
was
you
or
one
of
you
that
found
out
that
they
actually
were
with
campaign
which
was
interesting
but
surprised
want
the
credit
for
it
but
be
lambasted
and
remember
this
so
out
of
the
almost
million
that
was
raised
not
one
penny
did
take
for
administration
cost
unheard
of
how
else
am
going
to
raise
the
money
how
else
am
going
to
raise
the
money
would
have
given
just
so
you
understand
until
was
so
the
only
one
in
the
world
that
could
raise
almost
million
for
the
veterans
have
uniform
applause
by
the
groups
and
end
up
being
by
the
press
yes
made
and
during
the
said
raise
little
money
for
the
vets
it
turned
out
to
be
lot
of
money
not
little
money
thought
if
we
could
get
to
million
it
would
be
great
which
it
would
have
been
right
do
raise
millions
no
think
so
no
raised
almost
million
some
of
it
come
through
but
more
money
is
coming
through
than
come
through
the
number
probably
is
going
to
be
when
we
finish
it
probably
going
to
be
over
the
million
mind
it
coming
from
the
opposition
what
do
mind
is
when
raise
all
of
these
millions
and
when
we
started
out
nobody
ever
thought
it
was
going
to
be
over
million
or
close
to
million
so
look
the
story
the
story
think
and
been
dealing
with
the
press
long
time
think
the
political
press
is
among
the
most
dishonest
people
ever
met
have
to
tell
you
that
okay
but
think
the
political
press
think
the
political
press
see
the
stories
and
see
the
way
attached
for
instance
went
down
this
weekend
to
do
rolling
thunder
was
invited
have
anything
to
do
with
it
we
had
tremendous
gathering
of
people
thousands
know
how
many
thousands
but
many
thousands
of
people
and
joked
oh
thought
we
were
going
to
go
from
the
memorial
to
the
was
joking
they
said
trump
was
disappointed
everybody
knew
was
being
sarcastic
and
joking
they
said
some
of
them
said
trump
was
very
disappointed
that
it
go
from
to
lincoln
you
know
millions
of
people
was
joking
said
oh
used
to
watching
it
we
had
was
joking
so
they
put
it
down
as
serious
they
know
was
joking
give
you
another
example
we
had
certain
same
event
it
was
roped
off
where
you
could
only
get
so
many
people
there
and
there
were
lot
of
people
know
maybe
know
there
was
lot
of
people
plus
there
were
people
breaking
the
seams
all
the
way
along
washington
man
like
actually
wrote
an
article
said
there
were
people
there
there
were
many
times
that
and
you
allowed
to
have
any
more
people
and
all
of
these
people
were
with
their
motorcycles
in
parking
lots
all
the
way
they
were
waving
to
me
as
going
but
wait
minute
the
point
is
law
enforcement
these
people
allow
you
to
have
any
more
people
had
tremendous
crowd
but
it
was
the
biggest
crowd
you
could
have
had
it
was
all
cordoned
off
you
allowed
to
have
any
more
you
allowed
to
have
any
more
people
than
that
so
instead
of
saying
trump
made
in
front
of
packed
crowd
they
said
trump
was
disappointed
because
have
millions
of
people
going
from
to
washington
mean
give
me
break
honestly
dishonest
reporting
well
the
veterans
believe
me
let
me
tell
you
the
veterans
why
they
believe
and
have
group
that
gave
invites
veteran
to
speak
could
have
asked
all
these
groups
he
just
showed
up
just
saw
him
but
could
have
asked
all
these
groups
to
come
here
and
they
could
have
made
want
to
do
that
not
looking
for
credit
but
what
want
is
when
raise
millions
of
dollars
have
people
say
like
this
sleazy
guy
over
here
from
sleaze
in
my
book
sleaze
because
you
know
the
facts
and
you
know
the
facts
well
veteran
thank
you
trump
first
of
all
for
the
record
state
representative
from
new
years
on
the
veterans
affairs
committee
years
in
the
marine
corps
retired
first
sergeant
what
want
to
clarify
here
first
of
all
would
never
ever
in
million
years
put
my
name
on
candidate
that
did
not
from
his
heart
look
me
in
the
eye
and
tell
me
concerned
about
veterans
trump
met
him
over
year
ago
been
involved
in
many
fundraisers
there
are
many
out
there
he
did
the
right
thing
by
vetting
these
groups
there
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
groups
given
cents
cents
on
the
dollar
and
spending
the
rest
for
you
know
their
nice
lavish
trips
he
gave
the
liberal
media
is
the
only
ones
that
have
been
calling
the
foundation
all
right
former
chairman
been
dealing
with
this
stuff
for
years
as
veterans
activist
stop
using
veterans
as
political
pawns
got
guy
outside
go
do
search
on
his
out
there
his
pictures
with
they
are
using
veterans
as
political
pawns
it
must
stop
trump
is
doing
this
with
heart
all
focused
on
the
way
raising
money
and
not
looking
at
the
veterans
that
are
killing
each
other
everyday
not
concerned
about
the
thousands
of
veterans
that
are
on
look
at
his
plans
on
his
trump
website
he
talks
about
medical
cards
he
talks
about
fixing
the
he
talks
about
competition
think
the
liberal
media
and
been
dealing
with
you
long
time
you
need
to
get
your
head
out
of
your
butt
focus
on
the
real
issues
thank
you
what
did
ask
gotten
to
know
little
bit
primarily
through
new
where
we
had
great
victories
but
he
showed
up
this
morning
because
he
was
upset
and
many
of
the
other
groups
were
upset
they
received
in
the
mail
they
even
know
what
it
was
for
it
was
from
me
other
groups
received
they
know
what
it
was
for
and
again
upstairs
have
received
phones
calls
with
people
crying
have
received
letters
heartfelt
letters
the
bad
part
about
the
dishonesty
of
the
media
is
that
people
like
me
will
be
inclined
not
to
do
it
anymore
because
why
should
you
raise
million
and
think
go
over
million
pretty
easily
nobody
said
that
we
started
this
out
as
small
little
project
where
it
was
less
than
million
because
it
kept
just
mushrooming
and
building
and
building
but
nobody
talks
about
that
so
we
raised
million
we
have
so
many
happy
groups
so
many
happy
veterans
and
then
see
these
people
outside
now
of
course
they
know
the
extent
they
probably
figured
based
on
reading
the
press
that
trump
make
you
know
raise
this
kind
of
money
but
we
raised
lot
and
be
raising
more
and
be
sending
it
to
other
people
as
we
get
along
complicated
process
no
it
you
know
the
government
sort
of
approves
different
groups
for
lot
of
reasons
so
it
really
does
and
more
than
anything
else
also
speaking
to
other
veterans
we
have
circle
of
veterans
want
to
send
check
to
group
that
do
good
work
so
called
vetting
we
vet
the
vets
but
called
vetting
think
bothersome
because
love
the
vets
and
worked
hard
for
the
vets
and
as
you
can
see
given
lot
of
money
and
raised
lot
of
money
for
the
vets
and
think
when
the
press
portrays
it
differently
the
press
is
being
very
dishonest
so
like
that
like
dishonesty
sessions
is
fantastic
man
sessions
is
one
of
the
most
highly
respected
people
in
the
united
states
senate
sessions
is
person
that
believe
that
ted
has
the
most
respect
for
and
think
ted
thought
that
he
would
get
an
endorsement
you
know
sessions
has
never
endorsed
presidential
candidate
before
as
many
years
as
been
in
the
senate
so
you
know
sessions
is
certainly
somebody
that
would
consider
absolutely
fantastic
person
think
it
was
very
tough
call
it
was
amazing
because
there
were
moments
with
the
gorilla
the
way
he
held
that
child
that
almost
like
mother
holding
baby
looks
so
beautiful
and
calm
and
there
were
moments
where
it
looked
pretty
dangerous
think
they
had
choice
mean
probably
they
have
choice
you
have
child
young
child
at
stake
you
know
too
bad
there
another
way
thought
it
was
so
beautiful
to
watch
that
powerful
almost
pound
gorilla
and
the
way
he
dealt
with
that
little
boy
but
it
just
takes
one
second
one
second
not
like
it
takes
place
over
well
going
to
do
it
seconds
from
now
it
just
takes
one
little
flick
of
his
finger
and
will
tell
you
they
probably
had
no
choice
entirely
in
of
fixing
the
health
care
is
one
of
the
great
catastrophes
in
this
country
going
on
you
look
at
happening
in
phoenix
and
different
places
throughout
the
country
where
catching
people
stealing
and
they
even
fire
them
where
people
are
waiting
five
days
six
days
seven
days
on
line
dying
while
they
wait
on
line
and
am
in
of
if
they
get
to
doctor
within
reasonable
period
of
time
going
to
see
doctor
and
the
going
to
pay
for
it
going
to
go
to
private
doctor
or
public
hospital
and
public
doctor
but
some
place
that
can
take
them
immediately
losing
thousands
of
people
waiting
on
line
and
the
veterans
administration
is
run
by
just
as
incompetently
as
running
our
country
you
look
at
the
you
look
at
going
on
at
the
airports
and
you
look
at
that
okay
just
take
look
at
that
like
the
veterans
administration
nothing
in
our
country
works
anymore
mess
and
maybe
why
doing
so
well
in
the
polls
no
it
have
to
be
no
it
have
to
be
what
it
has
to
be
is
when
on
line
and
they
say
going
to
be
seven
day
wait
that
person
is
going
to
walk
over
to
across
the
street
to
private
doctor
be
taken
care
of
going
to
pay
the
bill
and
by
the
way
going
to
be
lot
less
expensive
and
check
it
out
and
be
careful
but
going
to
be
lot
less
expensive
than
going
on
these
people
are
living
in
hell
and
said
the
veterans
administration
is
working
just
fine
and
the
head
of
it
bob
said
last
week
that
waiting
in
line
is
not
bad
look
at
world
okay
these
are
the
kind
of
people
we
have
running
things
ridiculous
their
choice
you
have
party
called
the
democrats
and
going
to
have
to
make
that
choice
think
probably
going
to
be
her
because
rigged
and
think
if
you
people
will
say
the
one
that
came
up
with
the
term
rigged
used
it
for
myself
except
that
won
by
such
big
margins
that
the
whole
system
is
rigged
on
both
sides
with
the
republicans
less
obvious
with
democrats
with
the
whole
super
delegate
thing
ridiculous
so
think
that
going
to
have
to
make
that
determination
if
asking
me
who
prefer
running
against
think
what
she
did
was
very
bad
and
think
lot
of
people
have
done
lot
less
than
her
and
their
lives
have
been
destroyed
the
judge
has
been
very
unfair
has
not
done
good
job
been
very
bad
judge
has
been
very
unfair
and
will
win
the
trump
university
case
already
am
as
far
as
concerned
but
will
win
the
trump
university
case
because
care
have
judge
very
very
unfair
well
see
it
in
court
documents
but
have
judge
very
very
unfair
he
knows
unfair
and
win
the
trump
university
case
can
settle
that
case
could
have
settled
it
just
choose
not
to
in
fact
when
ran
this
they
said
why
you
settle
up
that
case
want
to
settle
the
case
because
you
know
what
because
man
of
principle
and
most
of
the
people
that
took
those
courses
have
letters
saying
they
thought
it
was
great
essentially
it
was
good
it
was
great
and
you
know
what
when
on
the
stand
and
you
say
how
come
you
signed
the
letter
saying
that
trump
university
was
so
good
how
come
you
signed
the
letter
the
woman
that
was
the
original
plaintiff
in
the
case
they
went
to
the
court
and
the
judge
allowed
her
to
get
out
of
the
case
the
case
should
have
been
dropped
the
whole
case
should
have
been
dropped
they
wanted
her
dismissed
from
the
case
you
know
why
because
she
was
deposed
she
was
such
bad
witness
that
win
the
case
easily
she
signed
letter
and
on
film
on
tape
like
these
cameras
saying
unbelievably
good
things
about
trump
university
so
they
want
her
anymore
because
disaster
for
them
so
they
went
to
the
judge
and
they
said
your
like
to
have
her
not
be
participant
not
be
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
he
said
oh
okay
the
one
that
started
the
case
now
they
even
want
her
to
testify
they
want
her
to
testify
because
disaster
she
has
all
sorts
of
beautiful
statements
about
it
and
importantly
on
tape
saying
how
great
it
is
they
want
her
want
her
either
now
could
have
settled
that
case
could
settle
that
case
can
settle
that
case
want
to
go
through
the
process
because
down
the
line
because
down
the
line
and
the
fact
that
you
win
as
independent
for
the
most
part
you
even
get
on
texas
and
various
other
states
now
too
late
but
texas
is
out
what
happens
what
happens
is
you
will
not
have
and
very
importantly
you
will
not
have
supreme
court
justices
going
to
lose
you
could
have
as
many
as
four
or
five
over
now
bill
the
one
but
the
last
one
forget
he
said
trump
will
never
run
the
not
smart
person
he
said
trump
would
never
run
remember
you
remember
actually
blame
you
why
do
you
put
this
guy
on
television
see
him
on
the
different
shows
got
no
credibility
said
run
if
run
do
well
if
do
well
this
and
that
he
looks
like
such
fool
saw
him
on
one
show
practically
crying
because
he
justify
now
he
comes
out
with
tweet
over
the
weekend
over
memorial
day
weekend
it
sounds
like
going
to
put
somebody
up
even
thought
it
thought
oh
going
to
find
now
he
comes
out
with
something
saying
he
was
almost
almost
kidding
okay
let
me
tell
you
these
people
are
losers
trying
to
make
you
trying
to
drive
you
guys
little
bit
nuts
if
they
do
an
assuming
decent
which
think
anybody
with
reputation
would
do
it
because
look
like
fools
but
what
going
to
do
is
you
lose
the
election
for
the
republicans
and
therefore
you
lose
the
supreme
court
therefore
you
will
have
group
of
people
put
on
the
supreme
court
where
this
country
will
never
ever
recover
it
will
never
ever
be
the
same
no
say
that
said
bill
is
loser
and
tell
you
why
he
has
called
every
single
move
take
look
on
me
going
to
lose
this
state
won
in
landslide
say
everybody
many
say
everybody
wait
wait
wait
bill
is
loser
his
magazine
is
failing
as
you
know
going
to
be
down
think
it
even
survives
getting
some
free
publicity
but
bill
been
watching
this
for
two
years
trump
going
to
run
then
go
into
race
we
go
into
new

you
think
maybe
he
like
me
wrong

get
my
last
score
was
get
know
no

no
the
way
look
at
it
when
have
somebody
not
on
my
side
when
you
know
by
the
way
gotten
great
applause
from
the
press
in
terms
of
as
an
achievement
because
the
republican
party
is
really
well
unified
we
have
come
up
people
that
you
would
have
never
thought
possible
are
now
saying
support
trump
so
remember
that
we
talk
about
that
too
much
but
actually
last
week
the
big
story
was
how
fast
the
republican
party
is
healing
because
it
is
healing
process
it
was
rough
that
was
rough
campaign
can
this
the
real
is
how
fast
getting
together
now
if
have
republican
not
on
my
side
not
going
to
be
why
should
be
particularly
nice
to
that
person
not
going
to
go
after
it
like
would
or
crazy
but
you
know
what
why
should
be
nice
to
that
person
if
have
person
not
going
to
support
me
have
no
obligation
politically
may
be
right
may
be
wrong
but
who
am
very
honest
person
if
somebody
is
going
to
say
little
bit
negative
or
lot
negative
about
me
and
if
they
happen
to
be
republican
may
choose
to
hit
them
back
not
always
but
may
choose
to
hit
them
back
not
fan
of
mitt
mitt
lost
an
election
he
should
have
won
and
if
you
read
the
front
page
of
the
wall
street
journal
about
mitt
he
looks
like
fool
look
not
fan
of
mitt
just
so
you
understand
raised
lot
of
money
for
mitt
made
for
mitt
made
speeches
for
him
he
let
us
down
if
you
read
the
front
page
of
the
wall
street
journal
this
weekend
mitt
looks
like
fool
now
what
would
say
good
about
mitt
she
was
not
nice
and
was
fine
just
little
bit
of
jab
but
she
nice
and
you
think
going
to
change
not
changing
including
with
her
bob
dole
is
fan
of
mine
bob
dole
endorsed
me
so
tell
me
about
bob
dole
well
look
he
got
of
the
vote
last
time
watched
that
whole
situation
it
was
pretty
disgraceful
think
total
fringe
deal
think
fringe
candidate
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
look
at
him
and
watch
him
and
watch
his
motions
and
watch
what
he
says
think
that
he
is
fringe
candidate
when
you
do
little
research
on
that
think
not
going
to
be
factor
okay
no
not
all
of
you
just
many
of
you
yeah
it
is
yeah
it
is
let
me
tell
you
something
person
yeah
going
to
be
like
this
if
the
press
writes
false
stories
like
they
did
with
this
half
of
you
were
amazed
that
raised
all
of
this
money
if
the
press
writes
false
stories
like
they
did
where
wanted
to
keep
low
profile
want
the
credit
for
raising
all
this
money
for
the
vets
looking
for
the
credit
and
by
the
way
more
money
is
coming
in
looking
for
the
credit
but
had
no
choice
but
to
do
this
because
the
press
was
saying
raise
any
money
for
them
not
only
did
raise
it
much
of
it
was
given
long
time
ago
and
there
is
vetting
process
and
think
you
understand
that
but
when
raise
almost
million
and
probably
in
the
end
will
raise
more
than
six
because
more
is
going
to
come
in
and
is
coming
in
but
when
raise
million
as
of
today
more
is
coming
in
and
this
is
going
to
phenomenal
groups
and
have
many
of
these
people
vetting
the
people
getting
the
money
and
working
hard
and
then
we
have
to
read
probably
stories
or
certainly
close
in
the
newspapers
and
the
people
know
the
stories
are
false
going
to
continue
to
attack
the
press
look
find
the
press
to
be
extremely
dishonest
find
the
political
press
to
be
unbelievably
dishonest
will
say
that
okay
thank
you
all
very
much
thank
you
thank
you

much

started
as
you
know
not
very
long
ago
about
six
weeks
ago
and
was
told
that
had
point
deficit
and
went
there
and
worked
very
hard
and
campaigned
and
made
lots
of
speeches
and
met
lots
of
incredible
people
incredible
people
you
get
better
and
the
crowds
got
bigger
and
bigger
and
toward
the
end
it
was
like
want
to
leave
almost
said
maybe
just
never
leave
and
it
resonated
somehow
and
we
have
tremendous
victory
tonight
it
was
tremendous
victory
and
have
to
thank
bobby
knight
boy
bobby
knight
was
incredible
he
was
incredible
always
that
people
like
that
there
many
but
called
tough
smart
and
they
know
how
to
win
and
what
our
country
needs
we
have
to
win
again
we
have
to
know
how
to
win
and
we
won
been
losing
all
the
time
we
lose
with
our
military
we
beat
isis
we
lose
with
trade
we
lose
with
borders
we
lose
everything
not
going
to
lose
going
to
start
winning
again
and
going
to
win
big
league
believe
me
so
when
got
back
tonight
and
started
watching
all
of
the
different
networks
could
immediately
that
we
were
doing
very
well
and
it
really
looks
like
massive
victory
and
it
looks
like
we
win
all
delegates
and
must
say
in
staying
in
various
places
in
indiana
turned
on
the
television
and
all
saw
was
negative
negative
one
after
another
after
another
and
called
my
people
and
said
how
can
we
win
just
constantly
it
was
the
same
as
in
florida
you
know
been
negative
got
it
right
from
you
folks
okay
in
fact
two
weeks
ago
it
was
now
negative
most
of
which
are
absolutely
false
and
disgusting
and
said
how
can
anybody
endure
this
had
one
evening
two
nights
ago
where
literally
they
had
five
on
in
between
segments
of
show
that
was
watching
and
said
just
incredible
and
the
people
are
so
smart
they
buy
it
they
get
it
and
tremendous
tremendous
amounts
of
money
were
spent
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
and
they
were
comparing
it
they
think
it
was
probably
million
was
spent
against
me
and
we
spent
so
mean
to
me
the
way
supposed
to
be
something
that
makes
me
feel
really
really
very
good
and
now
going
to
where
have
just
hear
doing
really
wonderfully
look
forward
to
that
very
much
and
west
virginia
and
going
to
get
those
miners
back
to
work
tell
you
what
going
to
get
those
miners
back
to
work
not
going
to
be
and
watched
her
three
or
four
weeks
ago
where
she
was
talking
about
the
miners
as
if
they
were
just
numbers
and
she
was
talking
about
she
wants
the
mines
closed
and
she
will
never
let
them
work
again
let
me
tell
you
the
miners
in
west
virginia
and
which
was
so
great
to
me
last
week
and
ohio
and
all
over
going
to
start
to
work
again
believe
me
going
to
be
proud
again
to
be
miners
so
be
going
there
must
say
this
tremendous
run
that
had
started
with
new
york
when
we
had
almost
and
forget
with
three
people
so
with
two
people
is
massive
landslide
but
almost
just
little
over
when
you
have
that
kind
of
number
with
three
people
actually
unheard
of
and
all
throughout
it
was
people
then
then
you
know
tremendous
and
we
were
getting
very
high
numbers
and
some
of
the
numbers
in
my
opinion
that
got
in
the
early
stages
were
in
state
with
but
there
were
people
think
that
might
actually
be
more
and
better
than
getting
in
new
york
but
we
never
got
the
credit
for
that
but
now
we
need
the
credit
because
going
after
she
will
not
be
great
president
she
will
not
be
good
president
she
will
be
poor
president
she
understand
trade
her
husband
signed
perhaps
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
single
worst
trade
deal
ever
done
called
and
was
witnessed
to
the
carnage
over
the
last
six
weeks
especially
now
known
and
known
and
known
all
of
the
different
places
that
visited
in
new
york
and
then
and
then
which
treated
me
so
great
the
people
are
incredible
and
all
of
the
different
state
and
witnessed
what
done
really
firsthand
and
it
has
been
indeed
carnage
and
going
to
change
it
around
not
going
to
let
carrier
and
all
of
these
companies
just
think
they
can
move
go
to
another
country
make
their
products
sell
it
back
to
us
and
we
get
only
one
thing
we
get
unemployment
not
going
to
happen
anymore
folks
not
going
to
happen
anymore
going
to
bring
back
our
jobs
and
going
to
keep
our
jobs
not
going
to
let
companies
leave
now
if
they
want
to
go
to
different
state
good
luck
compete
but
when
they
start
going
to
different
countries
and
in
many
cases
countries
that
devalue
their
currency
and
make
it
impossible
for
our
companies
to
compete
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
and
if
they
want
to
do
it
anyway
there
will
be
consequences
and
there
will
be
very
very
serious
consequences
have
to
tell
you
that
competed
all
my
life
competitive
person
all
my
life
been
in
competitions
different
competitions
whether
sports
or
business
or
now
for
months
politics
and
have
to
tell
you
that
have
met
some
of
the
most
incredible
competitors
that
have
ever
competed
against
right
here
on
the
republican
party
you
know
we
started
off
with
that
number
and
just
so
you
understand
ted
know
if
he
likes
me
or
if
he
like
me
but
he
is
one
hell
of
competitor
he
is
tough
smart
guy
and
he
has
got
an
amazing
future
got
an
amazing
future
so
want
to
congratulate
ted
and
know
how
tough
it
is
tough
tough
had
some
moments
where
not
looking
so
good
and
not
great
feeling
and
so
understand
how
ted
feels
and
and
their
whole
beautiful
family
and
just
want
to
say
that
one
tough
competitor
and
can
say
that
for
the
others
mean
who
endorsed
me
incredible
guy
ben
who
was
right
up
there
one
of
the
first
he
just
called
me
and
said
movement
got
going
got
to
do
something
because
tell
you
what
an
incredible
movement
and
ben
endorsed
me
and
want
to
tell
you
that
is
an
incredible
man
and
we
want
to
keep
ben
totally
involved
because
going
to
win
going
to
win
in
november
and
going
to
win
big
and
going
to
be
america
first
you
know
made
the
other
day
and
talked
about
how
the
policemen
for
the
world
how
we
protect
other
countries
and
they
respect
us
and
they
take
care
of
us
and
they
treat
us
right
in
many
cases
and
not
going
to
happen
now
going
to
keep
things
going
and
going
to
keep
things
going
very
nicely
but
we
owe
soon
trillion
trillion
now
but
with
budget
that
was
recently
done
soon
it
will
be
trillion
and
just
not
in
position
that
in
years
ago
years
ago
years
ago
when
lot
of
these
things
took
place
and
began
taking
place
so
going
to
have
unbelievably
good
relationships
with
other
countries
but
likewise
they
have
to
treat
us
fairly
and
they
have
to
understand
that
what
been
doing
over
the
years
has
been
so
wrong
and
so
unfair
to
the
united
states
to
its
people
and
to
its
taxpayers
so
that
will
change
and
will
tell
you
going
to
end
up
liking
us
better
than
they
do
right
going
to
respect
us
in
this
building
right
upstairs
have
the
largest
bank
in
the
world
from
china
the
relationship
is
fantastic
we
have
great
relationships
with
many
foreign
countries
but
they
have
to
respect
us
and
they
have
to
understand
where
coming
from
and
you
know
it
is
street
and
the
street
means
that
going
down
one
side
and
coming
up
the
other
and
going
to
meet
and
we
are
going
to
have
something
going
to
be
really
fabulous
now
if
that
happen
if
for
some
reason
they
want
this
system
to
continue
the
way
going
now
which
is
not
fair
and
not
good
where
spending
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
probably
trillion
in
the
middle
east
and
we
have
to
build
our
infrastructure
our
roads
we
have
to
rebuild
our
bridges
our
airports
our
hospitals
in
this
country
become
close
to
third
world
country
you
look
at
some
of
our
airports
third
world
and
then
you
go
to
other
countries
and
you
see
places
like
never
seen
so
have
to
say
that
we
are
going
to
turn
it
around
going
to
build
up
our
military
bigger
better
stronger
than
ever
before
the
cheapest
thing
we
can
do
and
going
to
have
to
take
out
isis
and
going
to
have
to
take
them
out
fast
we
allow
that
cancer
to
continue
we
can
not
allow
it
to
continue
and
you
know
one
group
been
so
incredible
to
me
are
the
vets
the
veterans
and
been
treated
so
badly
so
badly
and
going
to
get
that
straightened
out
now
one
of
the
things
that
just
happened
which
to
me
is
very
exciting
and
happened
now
with
two
or
three
but
the
poll
came
out
yesterday
and
in
that
poll
now
leading
lot
of
good
things
and
going
to
continue
because
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
folks
not
going
to
be
able
to
make
great
trade
deals
we
have
such
bad
deals
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
what
we
do
with
the
military
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
what
going
to
do
on
the
border
including
the
wall
going
to
have
unbelievably
great
relationships
with
the
the
have
been
so
incredible
to
me
they
want
jobs
everybody
want
jobs
the
want
jobs
you
look
at
going
on
they
want
jobs
and
going
to
bring
back
our
jobs
going
to
save
our
jobs
and
people
are
going
to
have
great
jobs
again
and
this
country
which
is
very
very
divided
in
so
many
different
ways
is
going
to
become
one
beautiful
loving
country
and
going
to
love
each
other
going
to
cherish
each
other
going
to
take
care
of
each
other
and
going
to
have
great
economic
development
and
not
going
to
let
other
countries
take
it
away
from
us
because
been
happening
for
far
too
many
years
and
not
going
to
do
it
anymore
not

to
thank

by
stupidity
by
bad
deals
by
horrible
trades
by
which
wants
badly
and
which
is
going
to
destroy
this
partnership
is
disaster
is
pushing
it
hard
think
player
here
mean
the
guy
is
one
in
one
and
it
was
in
his
own
state
and
if
would
have
campaigned
there
two
more
days
instead
of
staying
in
florida
would
have
won
in
my
opinion
ohio
one
and
now
in
all
fairness
bush
was
doing
lot
better
than
that
many
people
were
doing
better
called
you
get
out
taking
my
votes
we
have
to
get
over
and
how
do
you
do
that
look
at
certain
point
in
life
what
you
do
is
you
say
one
in
in
other
words
won
one
out
of
states
and
you
do
what
did
which
was
great
and
you
do
what
rand
paul
did
and
you
do
what
lot
of
them
did
and
you
get
out
and
going
through
very
hard
time
and
she
has
been
so
supportive
and
so
like
just
incredible
of
what
all
what
trying
to
do
not
me
messenger
what
trying
to
do
make
america
great
again
and
bring
it
back
and
stop
letting
the
world
take
advantage
of
us
both
militarily
and
we
win
anymore
we
win
anymore
we
win
with
trade
we
win
with
the
military
we
pay
for
everybody
military
we
know
what
doing
and
she
saw
it
and
she
was
here
early
and
she
knows
that
going
to
take
care
of
our
people
and
going
to
be
america
first
got
to
be
america
first
we
have
no
choice
we
have
no
choice
and
with
friend
of
hers
very
who
is
tremendous
tremendous
woman
and
just
an
amazing
person
also
great
singer
but
even
mention
that
because
would
be
the
last
to
want
to
have
people
know
that
is
such
great
friend
of
young
and
young
just
want
to
bring
her
and
onto
the
stage
and
maybe
would
like
to
say
something
and
but
this
is
just
an
unbelievable
woman
so
could
ask
to
come
up
on
stage
please
and
by
the
way
if
you
want
you
could
put
your
name
up
and
you
say
want
to
run
and
you
go
to
the
convention
and
you
run
but
it
would
be
nice
to
see
because
tell
you
what
he
takes
my
votes
away
much
more
than
he
does
and
like
it
think
right
think
appropriate
but
you
know
what
if
we
have
to
live
with
him
we
still
beat
him
easily
okay
folks
mean
okay
but
voted
for
was
disaster
for
and
it
was
disaster
for
our
country
ted
wants
and
it
is
going
to
make
look
like
peanuts
what
doing
to
us
with
those
documents
and
is
the
one
that
insisted
that
we
talk
about
money
manipulation
which
is
devaluation
of
currencies
in
the
agreement
he
let
them
do
it
the
one
that
fought
currency
devaluation
the
single
biggest
tool
that
other
countries
have
for
taking
our
business
taking
our
money
and
taking
our
jobs
and
we
let
this
go
on
any
longer
now
controlled
by
their
controlled
by
the
people
that
put
up
their
campaign
contributions
controlled
you
know
with
the
lobbyists
in
washington
they
have
signs
on
their
forehead
like
stamped
into
their
forehead
take
care
of
specialists
take
care
of
take
care
of
oh
take
care
of
so
we
let
it
happen
anymore
we
let
it
happen
anymore
time
you
know
used
to
say
time
for
change
say
time
for
change
but
real
change
this
time
not
that
change
real
change
yesterday
president
yesterday
for
the
first
time
he
started
having
reservations
about
the
iran
deal
could
have
told
him
that
six
months
ago
nine
months
ago
long
before
it
was
signed
the
ink
even
dry
and
now
finally
starting
to
understand
it
was
big
beautiful
mistake
and
only
going
to
get
worse
and
by
the
way
iran
is
getting
worse
they
were
supposed
to
come
into
the
community
remember
what
bunch
of
babies
are
we
babies
are
we
babies
hello
over
there
they
were
supposed
to
come
into
the
community
and
they
were
supposed
to
you
know
get
involved
now
you
see
they
just
ordered
airbus
jets
those
are
the
big
jets
they
order
the
reason
one
of
the
reasons
is
we
restrict
them
from
spending
so
we
give
them
billion
and
not
even
allowed
to
give
us
money
by
investing
by
buying
our
products
okay
how
crazy
are
we
how
much
longer
is
it
going
to
last
when
are
we
going
to
get
smart
when
are
we
going
to
stop
we
as
country
are
being
ripped
off
we
are
being
ripped
off
by
virtually
every
single
country
in
the
world
okay
whether
militarily
or
trade
we
win
anymore
we
win
with
the
military
we
beat
isis
can
you
imagine
or
george
they
say
get
rid
of
isis
what
do
you
think
so
sad
to
see
happening
to
our
country
and
going
to
turn
it
around
and
going
to
change
it
and
going
to
make
it
rich
again
and
going
to
make
it
strong
again
so
and
so
many
different
elements
and
been
talking
about
trade
always
talk
about
trade
because
when
announced
on
june
coming
down
the
escalator
with
it
was
like
the
academy
awards
there
were
so
many
cameras
never
seen
anything
like
it
so
many
cameras
and
took
deep
breadth
and
said
go
because
we
have
to
do
it
you
know
it
takes
guts
running
for
president
believe
me
takes
guts
it
takes
lot
of
guts
believe
me
and
even
for
the
politicians
they
run
at
least
out
on
the
line
and
then
you
see
the
dishonesty
you
see
where
won
and
then
find
out
that
not
supposed
to
get
as
many
delegates
as
the
person
that
beat
what
kind
of
stuff
is
that
and
somebody
said
well
rule
and
another
rule
care
about
rules
folks
go
out
and
campaign
we
win
we
win
we
get
the
delegates
right
but
in
the
meantime
we
have
millions
more
votes
than
beaten
him
in
most
of
the
states
mean
just
winning
so
much
and
winning
by
almost
delegates
so
doing
great
and
think
we
close
it
out
before
the
convention
think
we
actually
close
it
out
before
the
convention
and
like
you
know
they
go
into
unfriendly
territory
and
the
champ
he
goes
in
and
they
say
what
do
you
think
you
may
have
an
unfriendly
decision
he
says
no
when
you
knock
them
out
no
unfriendly
decision
if
we
get
the
delegates
pulled
out
and
the
way
going
to
be
and
can
see
that
happening
because
more
and
more
people
are
calling
they
want
to
get
on
board
frankly
when
looked
at
what
happened
friend
of
mine
great
you
know
one
of
my
great
friends
he
lives
right
down
not
very
far
from
here
and
he
said
with
going
win
said
well
what
do
you
think
but
not
seeing
polls
that
are
great
little
bit
down
down
in
some
little
bit
down
he
says
no
no
going
to
win
but
you
have
to
be
there
you
have
to
come
in
and
you
have
to
talk
to
the
people

down
the
path
along

lake
woman
saw
poor
snake
his
pretty
skin
had
been
all
frosted
with
the
dew
well
she
cried
take
you
in
and
take
care
of
me
in
oh
tender
woman
take
me
in
for
sake

me
in
oh

woman
cried
the
broken
snake
she
wrapped
him
up
all
in
curvature
of
silk
and
then
laid
him
by
the
fireside
with
some
honey
and
some
milk
now
she
hurried
home

him
to
her
bosom
so
beautiful
she
cried
if
brought
you
in
by
now
sake
you
might
have
now
she
stroke
his
pretty
skin
and
then
she
kissed
him
and
held
him
tight
but
instead
of
saying
thank
you
that
snake
gave
her
vicious
bite
me
in
oh
tender
woman
take
me
in
for
sake

the
woman

bit
me
why
you
know
your
bite
is
poisonous
and
now
going
to
shut
up
silly
woman
said
the
reptile
with
grin
knew
damn
well
was
snake
before
you
took
me
right
happening
to
our
country
folks
happening
to
our
country
and
we
let
it
happen
we
have
to
be
smart
we
have
to
be
vigilant
we
have
to
be
strong
and
if
not
not
going
to
have
country
and
we
need
borders
and
going
to
have
borders
and
we
need
great
trade
deals
and
going
to
make
great
trade
deals
and
we
let
mexico
and
have
great
respect
for
mexico
and
respect
their
leaders
but
we
let
mexico
and
china
and
any
country
you
want
to
name
steal
our
business
steal
our
jobs
when
you
look
at
happening
in
and
you
see
it
the
reason
beat
your
governor
and
beat
him
badly
was
just
read
off
the
statistics
just
read
all
did
stood
up
and
read
statistics
losing
jobs
very
average
very
average
our
country
is
less
than
average
okay
our
country
is
doing
so
badly
and
just
one
of
those
things
and
we
have
to
smarten
up
and
we
have
to
get
really
tough
we
have
to
get
so
so
so
vigilant
and
not
be
so
politically
correct
we
have
to
do
right
for
our
country
when
the
great
ford
motor
company
great
company
when
they
build
billion
plant
in
mexico
when
moves
its
massive
plant
to
mexico
from
chicago
we
let
it
happen
when
carrier
air
conditioners
as
you
know
they
just
announced
moving
to
mexico
is
moving
to
ireland
but
let
me
just
tell
you
so
watched
the
politicians
and
they
have
no
business
instincts
but
more
importantly
taken
care
of
you
know
lot
of
friends
come
up
to
me
and
they
say
let
me
ask
you
question
these
politicians
are
they
really
that
dumb
said
no
not
actually
that
dumb
some
are
but
not
actually
that
dumb
all
taken
care
of
by
the
special
interests
and
when
you
want
something
done
you
see
certain
people
in
washington
hey
who
is
better
than
me
mean
take
look
at
me
was
before
june
was
part
of
the
establishment
and
they
will
do
not
right
for
you
but
they
will
do
right
for
the
company
they
represent
or
the
country
they
represent
and
the
united
states
continues
to
get
ripped
off
ripped
off
ripped
off
and
lot
of
times
say
how
can
deal
be
so
stupidly
made
these
people
are
so
stupid
not
stupid
doing
it
for
themselves
doing
it
because
they
want
campaign
contributions
doing
it
because
they
want
money
put
in
their
they
are
totally
controlled
by
the
money
believe
me
they
are
totally
controlled
by
the
money
and
not
good
for
our
country
okay
not
good
because
terrible
things
are
happening
and
getting
weaker
and
weaker
hundreds
of
thousands
and
even
millions
of
jobs
are
being
taken
out
you
look
at
the
jobs
we
have
even
in
mean
you
see
the
jobs
the
manufacturing
all
so
down
and
so
gloomy
and
throughout
the
united
states
and
disaster
going
on
in
our
country
not
going
to
have
jobs
left
and
they
do
it
with
manipulation
of
currency
and
they
do
it
with
guile
they
do
it
with
so
many
different
elements
that
our
people
even
know
happening
our
politicians
in
most
cases
even
know
happening
and
when
they
do
know
happening
and
they
let
it
happen
even
worse
so
not
taking
money
from
anybody
my
campaign
and
going
to
get
it
going
to
get
it
now
look
at
this
manufacturing
mean
just
look
at
this
look
at
these
charts
mean
you
can
see
them
this
is
where
going
you
know
not
good
right
this
is
where
going
there
was
one
that
just
saw
just
got
this
like
incredible
look
at
this

any
jobs

the
jobs
we
have
now
are
bad
jobs

good
jobs
and
everybody
admits
that
even
the
other
side
says
we
agree
bad
jobs

the
number
that
they
talk
about
when
they
say
unemployment
fictitious
number
when
you
stop
looking
for
job
considered
statistically
employed
it
was
number
that
was
made
up
years
ago
probably
by
president
but
certainly
by
politicians
to
make
them
look
good
to
make
them
look
really
good
like
the
economy
the
economy
is
not
good
the
economy
is
bad
sitting
on
bubble
the
banks
have
money
they
give
it
to
you
for
nothing
if
rich
if
not
rich
when
you
need
the
money
they
loan
it
to
you
so
the
people
do
jobs
probably
here
you
have
some
great
companies
some
really
good
smaller
companies
you
get
the
banks
to
give
you
money
the
banks
are
controlled
by
the
regulators
they
system
that
this
country
is
run
under
is
out
of
control
and
going
to
change
it
going
to
bring
back
the
jobs
going
to
bring
back
our
companies
and
you
know
had
such
response
and
the
reason
had
response
is
because
of
that
and
then
look
at
the
today
in
hotel
and
look
at
the
and
makes
up
these
going
to
bring
back
jobs
using
my
same
language
the
problem
they
know
where
to
begin
they
know
where
to
begin
and
if
they
did
ted
he
comes
up
did
you
ever
see
guy
like
this
just
look
what
he
did
with
ben
ben
who
endorsed
me
by
the
way
is
great
guy
and
ted
remember
in
he
said
ben
has
left
the
race
left
the
race
this
was
on
election
day
not
like
two
days
before
or
the
day
after
during
the
election
he
left
the
race
okay
and
people
believed
him
and
thousands
of
votes
were
cast
not
for
ben
but
for
ted
pure
deception
lying
and
then
there
were
many
other
things
and
actually
during
one
of
the
debates
looked
over
and
he
said
liar
and
said
you
know
never
heard
politician
call
another
politician
liar
so
we
can
do
it
so
we
now
call
him
ted
crazy
crazy
mean
what
he
does
and
what
he
says
is
just
terrible
and
you
know
met
lot
tougher
people
but
never
met
any
human
that
lied
as
much
as
him
and
he
comes
in
and
you
noticed
the
tremendous
evangelical
support
have
have
from
liberty
university
have
all
of
these
people
have
such
incredible
support
and
the
evangelicals
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
the
evangelicals
but
they
like
liars
and
they
see
he
lies
so
much
do
you
ever
see
him
he
walks
up
and
he
walks
in
with
the
bible
held
high
right
held
high
and
then
he
starts
to
lie
boy
he
is
bad
so
anyways
think
that
going
to
fall
for
that
really
think
that
anybody
is
going
to
fall
he
talk
he
debates
said
ted

it
easy

whole
thing

not
conservative
said
what
am
conservative
but
you
know
what
believe
in
free
trade
but
when
you
have
free
trade
you
need
smart
people
running
your
side
of
the
free
trade
if
you
have
smart
people
or
if
you
have
people
like
ted
that
are
totally
controlled
by
the
people
that
give
him
the
money
and
controlled
by
the
establishment
mean
look
at
the
establishment
this
guy
in
his
whole
life
know
what
the
word
establishment
meant
now
you
have
all
these
people
going
because
they
said
oh
man
trump
is
terrible
he
want
any
of
our
money
had
one
friend
that
came
into
my
office
think
ever

this
before
he
came
into
my
office
he
wanted
to
give
me
millions
of
dollars
said
take
your
money
want

money
he
said
no

got
to
be
kidding
he
even
know
he
thought
was
kidding
he
wanted
to
endorse
me
wanted
to
support
me
said
no
no
want
anyway
he
was
finally
convinced
that
want
his
money
and
leaving
and
said
by
the
way
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
he
said
going
to
give
it
to
another
candidate
and
said
why
gamblers
they
have
to
do
it
like
almost
disease
they
have
to
do
it
the
craziest
thing
he
loves
me
he
wants
to
give
give
me
probably
close
to
million
right
would
have
had
the
greatest
super
in
the
history
if
would
have
taken
all
the
money
and
my
whole
life
you
know
said
this
before
my
whole
life
as
business
person
is
this
right
okay
nothing
wrong
with
it
take
keep
taking
take
and
take
but
now
going
to
take
for
the
united
states
going
to
take
not
going
to
be
the
stupid
people
anymore
not
going
to
be
the
stupid
people
anymore
we
be
we
be
and
with
nato
when
they
pay
you
know
said
was
asked
question
by
wolf
very
fair
question
about
nato
now
you
know
been
businessman
world
class
filed
my
business
papers
they
were
phenomenal
everybody
says
great
great
great
built
great
company
very
little
debt
tremendous
cash
flow
some
of
the
greatest
assets
in
the
world
and
tell
you
that
only
for
one
reason
the
thinking
we
need
in
washington
we
need
some
of
that
thinking
and
wolf
asked
me
question
on
television
he
said
let
me
just
ask
you
about
nato
now
been
asked
about
nato
lot
but
understand
nato
and
understand
common
sense
and
like
smart
person
like
many
of
the
people
in
this
room
hopefully
all
of
the
people
in
this
room
but
he
asked
me
about
nato
said
obsolete
this
was
my
first
thing
and
you
know
what
the
first
one
guys
that
study
nato
and
good
people
but
they
study
nato
and
they
say
believe
it
what
he
just
said
never
thought
of
it
they
study
it
because
so
into
it
that
they
because
it
was
really
put
there
you
had
the
soviet
union
and
now
you
have
russia
which
is
different
but
russia
is
powerful
so
we
could
sort
of
say
balance
so
leave
it
but
it
really
cover
terrorism
like
supposed
to
have
the
right
countries
mean
many
of
the
countries
and
there
that
you
associate
with
terrorism
and
so
said
number
one
obsolete
said
number
two
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
the
united
states
pay
far
too
much
proportionately
and
why
are
we
always
paying
the
bills
to
protect
other
people
and
the
press
which
is
so
totally
dishonest
the
press
goes
headlines
the
next
day
trump
want
nato
wants
to
disband
nato
and
not
what
said
said
got
to
pay
your
bills
and
you
know
what
if
you
pay
your
bills
honestly
there
should
be
got
to
go
because
we
do
it
you
know
this
years
ago
this
when
it
was
originally
formed
like
many
many
years
ago
many
decades
ago
and
you
have
to
things
but
it
is
interesting
some
of
the
smartest
people
have
said
what
trump
said
is
genius
obsolete
and
you
know
what
true
lot
of
people
lot
of
countries
being
given
free
ride
we
have
the
free
rides
any
more
folks
thank
you
well
we
need
somebody
with
that
and
america
first
folks
america
first
so
then
as
you
know
north
korea
is
big
problem
north
korea
is
problem
problem
that
could
be
solved
easily
by
china
but
they
want
to

it
because
they
want
to
tweak

can
you
imagine
did
you

see
deal
take
so
long
by
the
way
usually
when
deal
takes
that
long
bad
automatically
can
usually
tell
you
that
but
anyway
so
we
protect
japan
so
it
comes
out
said
look

have
to
tell
japan
and
talking
about
other
nations
also
because
have
great
friends
from
japan

have
meeting
with
them
we
love
protecting
you
we
want
them

at
some
point
how
long
are
we
going

we
have
to
see
them
and
we
have
to
say
got
to
help
us
out
you
know
we
have
this
massive
massive
amount
of
money
that
we
have
to
get

our
military

what
the
was
telling
the
people
and
they
said
wow
that
sounds
good
got
to
take
got
to
take
care
of
us
now
probably
say
initially
no
and
then
we
leave
and
then
going
to
say
yes
but
if
they
say
yes
you
always
have
to
be
prepared
to
make
great
deal
to
walk
you
have
to
be
the
problem
with
the
iran
deal
was
that
secretary
was
like
an
amateur
call
him
amateur
night
he
refused
to
walk
they
were
laughing
at
him
in
the
streets
of
iran
they
were
claiming
the
deal
was
the
greatest
deal
ever
made
before
it
was
even
made
they
were
saying
this
deal
is
unbelievable
they
were
laughing
at
the
secretary
of
state
of
this
country
they
were
laughing
at
the
united
states
saying
that
this
deal
is
great
and
they
were
dancing
remember
burning
the
flag
dancing
when
they
start
dancing
about
deal
that
making
when
they
start
burning
the
american
flag
out
of
there
bye
bye
good
luck
and
he
just
kept
going
back
and
kept
waiting
wanted
to
call
him
wanted
to
call
him
wanted
to
say
walk
because
every
single
thing
say
we
would
like
to
get
this
no
oh
okay
got
it
we
would
like
to
get
that
no
you
know
the
are
great
negotiators
an
unbelievable
deal
but
just
yesterday
just
yesterday
he
brought
it
up
that
very
unhappy
mean
think
of
it
think
of
it
billion
the
worst
deal
we
get
our
prisoners
back
we
should
have
had
the
prisoners
back
before
we
started
negotiating
increase
the
sanctions
sit
at
the
table
say
you
give
our
prisoners
back
or
not
starting
you
leave
say
no
you
leave
and
what
happens
you
double
up
the
sanctions
within
hours
they
call
you
and
they
say
got
your
prisoners
that
could
have
been
years
ago
right
so
we
have
people
that
know
what
doing
the
story
you
need
trump
you
do
you
need
trump
you
bet
you
do
mean
got
to
have
trump
mean
sort
of
interesting
because
see
when
turn
on
the
television
see
these
about
myself
by
crooked
people
see
these
and
mostly
wrong
little
bit
sometimes
are
right
but
all
negative
you
know
and
looking
watching
this
on
television
after
in
florida
they
spent
million
on
negative
and
won
it
in
landslide
does
anybody
read
does
anybody
watch
television
you
know
not
much
for
the
advertising
community
when
you
think
they
spent
million
record
number
in
florida
they
spent
thousands
and
thousands
of
nationwide
listen
to
this
one
negative
on
me
most
of
them
was
made
up
give
you
one
good
example
we
have
the
club
for
growth
which
is
forget
them
these
are
among
the
dumbest
people
that
ever
meet
they
come
to
my
office
they
want
me
to
give
them
million
friend
asked
me
please
see
them
said
who
are
they
club
for
growth
whatever
that
means
so
they
come
to
my
office
they
asked
me
for
million
say
no
thank
you
and
it
then
they
write
me
letter
which
posted
asking
me
for
million
said
very
nicely
not
bad
person
said
nicely
no
thank
you
mean
you
can
be
rich
but
you
have
to
be
stupid
okay
why
am
going
to
give
them
million
so
what
happens
is
all
of
sudden
see
their
name
all
over
the
place
club
for
growth
and
they
talk
about
you
know
different
things
ridiculous
things
mean
the
worst
and
by
the
way
once
was
fraudulent
because
they
said
if
and
got
together
and
you
added
the
delegates
and
they
showed
the
delegates
right
and
you
add
them
up
and
over
here
with
lot
and
they
said
and
they
add
them
up
and
they
show
graph
that
goes
much
higher
than
mine
and
much
lower
than
mine
fraud
and
what
we
did
is
we
told
them
to
stop
that
and
that
was
week
ago
and
we
about
it
and
talking
about
it
and
see
it
last
night
again
crooked
so
what
they
do
like
form
of
extortion
guess
right
when
you
think
of
it
they
come
to
your
office
they
ask
for
million
you
give
them
million
they
go
out
they
do
negative
these
are
the
people
you
know
if
these
people
about
trump
they
call
it
like
no
trump
what
do
they
call
that
thing
they
call
it
never
trump
oh
you
need
trump
so
badly
though
was
saying
if
they
would
work
if
they
would
have
worked
so
hard
so
diligently
against
president
they
would
have
beaten
him
they
would
have
had
great
budgets
they
would
have
had
everything
they
wanted
but
with
him
always
say
is
the
worst
negotiator
ever
seen
you
look
at
the
no
except
with
the
republicans
he
gets
everything
he
wants
mean
you
look
at
the
omnibus
budget
from
three
months
he
got
everything
he
wanted
fund
bring
people
into
the
country
that
be
here
he
got
everything
he
wanted
so
he
is
the
worst
negotiator
worldwide
we
have
sergeant
right
we
get
traitor
no
no
think
of
it
this
is
negotiation
we
get
and
they
get
what
do
they
get
five
of
their
most
coveted
killers
that
have
been
in
jail
for
eight
years
in
which
not
closing
down
by
the
way
okay
going
to
run
it
so
we
get
traitor
who
five
or
six
probably
six
people
were
killed
going
out
to
try
and
get
him
back
he
left
traitor
so
we
get
and
what
we
get
and
they
get
five
people
that
are
right
now
back
on
the
battlefield
or
soon
to
be
back
on
the
battlefield
trying
to
kill
everybody
in
sight
including
us
okay
got
to
stop
it
got
to
stop
it
so
with
japan
said
they
got
to
maybe
got
to
walk
and
the
next
day
the
headlines
trump
want
to
defend
japan
trump
wants
japan
to
get
their
okay
the
story
folks
you
have
japan
japan
is
very
concerned
with
north
korea
you
know
number
one
like
the
way
it
is
now
but
want
them
to
pay
lot
more
money
they
probably
will
but
if
they
not
so
bad
if
they
are
at
heads
maybe
not
supposed
to
get
into
that
fight
bad
fight
maybe
not
supposed
to
okay
okay
same
thing
with
south
korea
mean
every
time
he
raises
his
head
and
he
starts
talking
every
single
time
he
raises
his
head
our
ships
start
floating
over
our
planes
start
going
over
we
do
all
sorts
of
exercise
what
are
we
get
out
of
this
we
have
soldiers
on
the
line
so
we
have
to
be
taken
care
of
now
talking
as
person
financially
okay
also
talking
militarily
but
talking
financially
we
have
country
that
can
do
this
anymore
saudi
arabia
until
the
oil
went
down
and
now
still
making
fortune
but
saudi
arabia
was
making
billion
day
we
protect
saudi
arabia
if
we
there
saudi
arabia
be
there
if
saudi
arabia
have
us
for
years
protecting
them
they
would
have
been
gone
long
time
ago
as
saudi
arabia
somebody
else
would
have
it
probably
maybe
iraq
because
he
would
have
come
back
and
by
the
way
speaking
of
that
you
know
was
against
going
into
iraq
everyone
says
oh
trump
is
going
to
be
very
tough
was
against
going
into
iraq
from
the
very
beginning
from
the
very
beginning
and
going
to
build
our
military
bigger
stronger
than
ever
before
but
you
know
what
hopefully
we
never
have
to
use
it
going
to
tell
us
what
to
do
though
we
have
to
shape
it
up
because
our
military
is
totally
depleted
but
if
our
politicians
would
have
gone
to
the
beach
for
the
last
number
of
years
many
years
we
would
be
much
stronger
in
sense
be
much
stronger
because
the
middle
east
is
disaster
you
see
the
great
migration
catastrophe
you
see
going
on
in
germany
total
mess
what
she
has
done
can
you
imagine
she
was
person
of
the
year
was
supposed
to
be
person
of
the
year
on
time
magazine
she
beat
me
out
and
she
destroyed
germany
can
you
believe
this
not
good
wonder
if
time
magazine
had
that
one
to
do
over
again
what
say
think
be
in
much
better
shape
well
treated
me
nice
been
on
the
cover
lot
and
the
reason
on
the
cover
lot
is
because
we
have
movement
the
likes
of
which
people
have
never
seen
so
the
story
the
story
you
know
one
of
the
great
writers
called
me
up
and
he
said
what
done
is
incredible
said
no
no
have
to
win
he
said
no
no
it
makes
no
difference
if
you
win
if
you
lose
it
matter
what
done
is
down
in
the
history
books
you
will
be
cover
for
all
time
incredible
said
no
sir
no
sir
have
to
win
because
if
win
to
me
will
consider
it
tremendous
waste
of
time
and
waste
of
money
but
tremendous
waste
of
time
so
the
story
the
story
going
to
take
care
of
our
second
amendment
being
chipped
and
chipped
going
to
get
rid
of
common
core
going
to
bring
education
back
locally
going
to
repeal
and
replace
which
is
total
catastrophe
going
to
have
great
health
insurance
going
to
save
your
social
security
going
to
save
your
we
are
going
to
save
it
because
we
are
going
to
make
our
country
rich
again
going
to
bring
back
our
jobs
not
going
to
let
our
jobs
go
and
going
to
be
able
to
afford
been
paying
in
it
long
time
and
lot
of
these
guys
want
it
to
be
knocked
to
hell
not
going
to
happen
okay
remember
that
not
going
to
happen
going
to
start
winning
again
folks
we
win
anymore
we
win
anymore
we
win
with
our
military
we
beat
isis
going
to
win
going
to
knock
the
hell
out
of
isis
we
win
with
our
vets
our
vets
are
being
treated
worse
than
illegal
immigrants
our
vets
are
being
treated
so
unfairly
our
great
people
and
other
people
you
know
vets
have
endorsed
me
virtually
unanimously
and
lot
of
the
vets
will
come
up
to
me
and
say
you
know
trump
we
follow
closely
going
on
the
only
person
that
ever
mentions
the
vets
right
and
recently
said
about
the
vets
that
being
taken
care
of
just
fine
not
being
take
care
of
fine
not
being
taken
care
of
she
said
being
taken
care
of
just
fine
know
the
vets
spent
more
time
with
the
vets
that
are
running
and
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
okay
we
are
going
to
tear
up
and
make
great
and
very
lucrative
and
everybody
is
going
to
be
happy
including
the
other
side
trade
deals
have
the
greatest
people
in
the
world
for
dealing
we
use
political
hacks
that
know
what
doing
dealing
against
the
smartest
people
in
china
the
smartest
people
in
japan
the
smartest
people
from
all
over
the
world
and
our
negotiators
are
political
hacks
and
not
using
them
anymore
using
the
greatest
business
people
in
the
world
and
we
have
them
in
this
country
and
endorsing
me
and
know
the
best
ones
from
the
not
so
great
ones
and
going
to
have
great
great
trade
deals
going
to
have
strong
border
going
to
have
real
border
going
to
have
wall
mexico
is
paying
for
it
going
to
have
wall
and
going
to
stop
bad
bad
things
from
happening
in
this
country
because
if
you
look
at
going
on
and
you
look
at
the
tremendous
crime
and
you
look
at
the
drugs
that
are
pouring
across
the
border
the
drugs
are
pouring
like
water
pouring
across
you
know
when
won
new
is
special
place
to
me
because
they
were
the
first
victory
had
and
won
new
and
expected
to
win
it
was
expected
to
win
it
and
won
it
in
landslide
and
go
around
and
see
the
people
of
new
and
they
tell
me
trump
our
biggest
problem
is
heroin
said
heroin
it
make
sense
you
know
you
look
at
the
beautiful
trees
or
the
woods
or
the
roadways
and
the
lakes
said
heroin
it
just
work
incongruous
right
it
work
but
it
was
heroin
and
said
if
get
in
going
to
stop
that
problem
then
said
where
does
it
come
from
they
said
it
comes
from
the
southern
border
they
come
right
in
now
new
rated
it
their
number
one
problem
they
have
tremendous
problem
but
many
other
communities
including
you
but
many
other
communities
have
this
problem
going
to
stop
it
cold
folks
going
to
stop
it
cold
and
the
bottom
line
is
this
look
we
have
big
big
day
and
going
to
look
back
on
this
evening
and
going
to
say
that
was
one
of
the
great
evenings
of
your
life
because
we
love
the
country
we
love
the
country
love
you
too
thank
you
really
do
love
the
people
love
the
people
you
know
they
say
trump
my
base
is
so
strong
they
say
trump
can
do
almost
anything
in
fact
one
person
today
said
anything
and
they
interviewed
woman
saw
her
last
night
on
television
sitting
in
hotel
room
which
was
not
the
most
beautiful
room
ever
been
it
was
very
clean
and
only
want
clean
care
about
the
room
want
clean
but
they
were
sitting
there
and
they
said
to
woman
wonderful
woman
probably
years
old
and
her
friends
were
there
and
they
said
what
would
it
take
to
get
you
to
vote
for
somebody
other
than
trump
she
said
play
that
game
nothing
he
can
do
that
would
get
me
to
vote
against
him
and
wanted
to
go
up
and
wanted
to
hug
that
television
set
wanted
to
wish
could
find
out
who
she
is
but
we
have
so
many
people
like
that
all
like
that
mean
big
chunk
of
the
country
is
like
that
because
tired
of
stupidity
tired
of
seeing
happening
to
our
great
country
so
the
deal
going
to
go
home
and
going
to

more
importantly

happen
anymore
going

win
at
the
border

single
element
of
what

every

my
office
like
about
year
ago
before
did
you
know
been
politician
for
about
eight
months
right
never
thought
be
politician
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
want
to
be
was
politician
but
built
great
company
filed
papers
the
company
is
incredible
very
little
debt
tremendous
cash
flow
some
of
the
great
assets
in
the
world
and
say
that
not
in
bragging
way
say
that
because
the
kind
of
thinking
we
need
folks
we
have
china
ripping
us
off
and
mexico
and
japan
and
we
have
it
we
have
it
and
they
are
ripping
us
like
never
ripped
anybody
before
rebuilt
china
mean
rebuilding
mexico

look
the
other
day
you
saw
carrier
moving
down
carrier
air
conditioning

those
air
conditioners
lot
of
them
not
buying
any
more
of
them

home
of
the
formerly
wonderful
which
we
eat
anymore
right

it
number
one
good
called
an
enforced
diet
but
you
know
what
look
losing
our
jobs
look
at
your
jobs
when
see
that
statistic
mean
losing
your
jobs
when
went
after
your
governor
when
he
decided
to
run
and
said
you
know
going
to
be
nice
to
him
nice
guy
the
guy
came
up
to
my
office
he
handed
me
plaque
because
supported
him
what
do
know
supported
him
gave
or
lot
of
money
for
guy
never
met
before
right
pretty
good
but
like
the
fact
that
he
was
fighting
fighting
he
was
always
fighting
you
know
to
certain
extent
rather
see
somebody
able
to
make
deal
without
having
to
go
through
all
of
that
mess
but
he
was
fighting
and
gave
him
lot
of
money
and
he
came
up
you
know
year
ago
or
so
and
he
gave
me
plaque
beautiful
picture
of
something
never
really
got
to
read
it
to
be
honest
and
put
it
aside
that
was
it
because
if
we
win
going
to
be
like
over
pretty
much
over
because
going
to
do
great
poll
came
out
think
have
in
new
york

but
the
only
one
my
campaign
in
for
lot
of
money
in
lot
of

what
is
beautiful
is
when

new
was
in
for
like
million
was
in
for
like
million
was
in
first
and
he
was
close

last
said
who
do
you
want
as
your
president
by
the
way
did
endorse
anybody
yet
because
heard
because
think
probably
endorsed
huh
did
he
endorse
it
just
shows
you
how
important
it
is
nobody
even
knows
even
know
probably
endorse
just
so
you
know
look
when
in
war
got
to
fight
and
you
fight
hard
when
fight
win
going
to
win
you
know
that
going
to
win
but
you
know
you
do
pretty
serious
damage
right
because
you
want
to
win
and
you
want
to
win
fast
and
lot
of
people
love
you
after
you
finish
but
just
love
you
care
about
that
in
fact
asking
you
know
at
the
debate
which
by
the
way
they
said
won
every
single
debate
now
heard
the
other
night
want
to
debate
trump
debated
him
or
times
every
single
poll
has
me
winning
the
debates
an
okay
debater
but
bad
talker
you
know
so
dramatic
and
he
waits
phony
and
he
waits
you
know
you
ever
see
he
goes
sentence
after
sentence
and
then
he
stops
for
like
three
four
seconds
and
then
he
goes
again
it
looks
like
in
the
not
in
the
in
the
real
world
so
what
happens
thank
you
by
the
way
the
sheriff
is
here
and
great
guy
and
his
people
are
fantastic
thank
you
sheriff
thank
you
mean
the
only
thing
feel
so
guilty
about
all
the
people
outside
feel
so
guilty
going
to
come
back
going
to
come
back
come
back
to
this
area
you
guys
can
not
come
okay
all
of
the
ladies
can
come
but
the
guys
but
all
of
the
people
outside
going
to
take
bigger
place
because
feel
slightly
guilty
but
look
we
have
very
serious
mess
on
our
hands
we
have
very
serious
situation
we
have
country
not
protected
we
have
country
sitting
on
big
fat
bubble
going
to
explode
in
certain
way
say
let
it
do
now
do
it
after
get
in
three
days
explode
and
say
fault
okay
we
are
in
big
fat
ugly
bubble
we
have
interest
rates
that
are
so
low
that
if
rich
like
me
can
borrow
money
for
any
amount
if
hardworking
guy
with
great
farm
or
hardworking
developer
or
businessman
you
borrow
money
you
can
only
borrow
money
really
cheaply
think
of
how
bad
it
is
you
can
borrow
money
for
nothing
practically
if
rich
but
if
rich
you
need
the
money
so
you
have
to
borrow
it
but
if
and
you
want
to
go
to
the
bank
for
loan
you
get
it
the
regulators
are
running
the
banks
is
disaster
by
the
way
disaster
disaster
but
the
biggest
disasters
are
regulations
our
rules
and
regulations
are
horrible
going
to
get
rid
of
probably
of
them
there
are
some
we
live
with
but
got
to
go
back
so
many
people
in
this
area
have
told
me
regulations
regulatory
climate
is
the
worst
ever
seen
have
friend
farmer
and
if
puddle
forms
they
consider
it
lake
for
the
purposes
of
environmental
like
puddle
and
consider
it
lake
so
we
know
what
doing
so
happening
going
to
make
our
country
so
great
again
going
to
make
our
country
so
strong
again
our
military
is
going
to
be
so
amazing
never
going
to
have
to
use
it
forget
want
to
go
into
iraq
all
these
guys
think
that
tough
guy
so
going
to
be
so
quick
with
the
trigger
not
going
to
be
quick
was
the
slowest
with
the
trigger
want
the
trigger
now
when
left
though
he
have
left
the
way
he
did
he
gave
certain
date
and
the
enemy
said
it
be
possible
nobody
would
be
that
stupid
nobody
so
actually
think
hurt
that
much
because
think
the
enemy
would
ever
believe
that
anybody
would
be
stupid
enough
to
give
date
leaving
on
this
date
and
then
he
left
they
said
he
was
serious
they
pulled
back
they
pulled
back
then
you
see
what
happened
they
pulled
back
then
they
went
in
with
fury
but
how
about
the
soldiers
he
sent
couple
of
months
ago
few
months
ago
he
sent
of
our
finest
and
instead
of
just
sending
them
quietly
quietly
sending
them
what
does
he
do
he
sends
them
in
and
he
makes
big
press
conference
or
announcement
that
we
are
sending
soldiers
in
iraq
syria
and
these
soldiers
have
big
target
on
their
backs
why
we
just
keep
our
mouths
shut
why
we
be
unpredictable
unpredictable
right
why
we
be
unpredictable
why
does
he
have
to
tell
first
of
all
it
even
sound
good
when
you
say
soldiers
because
it
sounds
like
so
small
people
would
say
is
that
good
or
bad
mean
that
sounds
small
but
then
when
you
think
about
it
why
do
we
have
to
say
that
these
are
extraordinary
people
these
are
our
finest
and
you
know
very
dangerous
missions
why
would
you
tell
people
that
sending
them
in
you
just
keep
quiet
and
let
them
accomplish
something
they
are
right
now
who
knows
happened
to
them
but
right
now
they
have
big
target
on
their
back
people
that
let
go
of
at
have
now
killed
americans
seen
that
you
saw
that
yesterday
that
came
out
yesterday
we
let
people
go
out
of
and
they
kill
americans
okay
is
anybody
surprised
at
that
though
would
anybody
be
surprised
and
keeping
it
open
now
spending
you
know
hundreds
of
millions
to
run
it
guarantee
you
could
run
it
lot
cheaper
have
lot
of
money
left
over
so
going
to
get
efficiency
in
government
but
going
to
end
going
to
replace
it
with
something
so
much
better
and
so
much
less
expensive
going
to
get
rid
of
common
core
going
to
bring
our
education
local
we
are
going
to
preserve
our
second
amendment
under
siege
totally
under
siege
and
is
under
siege
tell
you
is
under
siege
you
take
look
with
the
tell
you
what
been
with
so
many
pastors
lately
and
was
an
example
was
telling
me
that
first
of
all
he
told
me
something
that
you
remind
me
so
much
of
my
father
thought
his
father
was
great
guy
what
his
father
did
with
liberty
college
and
liberty
university
and
to
top
it
off
has
taken
it
to
whole
new
place
but
when
was
so
strong
and
so
great
but
was
talking
to
probably
had
of
the
ministers
and
pastors
different
folks
came
up
to
my
office
and
really
under
tremendous
pressure
because
they
want
to
have
their
tax
exempt
status
taken
away
this
happened
during
the
presidency
and
said
why
is
it
that
you
folks
are
pushed
around
so
much
these
are
the
pastors
these
are
strong
people
these
are
really
strong
people
why
do
you
allow
that
why
you
more
forceful
and
finally
somebody
said
well
we
have
to
be
little
careful
of
our
tax
exempt
status
said
when
did
that
happen
exactly
it
was
during
the
well
going
to
try
to
get
rid
of
that
okay
because
really
terrible
going
to
try
getting
rid
of
and
said
that
to
lot
of
evangelicals
lot
of
great
going
to
try
to
get
rid
of
it
because
it
sort
of
means
somebody
walking
down
the
street
has
more
power
than
somebody
of
religion
of
our
religion
of
somebody
an
evangelical
you
take
anybody
they
have
more
power
because
these
people
are
powerless
actually
taken
their
right
of
free
away
so
said
going
to
try
to
get
rid
of
that
and
think
be
very
very
successful
you
know
interesting
said
how
many
are
there
because
you
know
got
men
got
women
you
cut
it
in
half
actually
have
few
more
women
but
we
are
far
more
than
we
have
men
or
women
so
in
way
the
most
powerful
lobbyist
the
biggest
group
of
people
but
not
allowed
to
talk
because
petrified
you
saw
what
was
happening
with
the
and
what
was
taking
place
with
regard
to
certain
groups
so
we
are
going
to
try
and
usually
when
say
try
that
means
going
to
get
it
done
that
means
going
to
get
it
done
but
we
are
going
to
try
very
hard
we
are
going
to
get
that
brought
back
and
think
going
to
be
very
hard
to
counter
it
because
if
the
and
if
the
whole
evangelical
christian
sector
gets
together
nobody
nobody
can
beat
you
know
when
made
the
statement
about
banning
muslims
on
temporary
basis
took
such
heat
now
people
are
saying
you
know
trump
is
sort
of
right
about
that
now
all
going
wow
because
they
see
happening
and
think
if
would
have
said
it
about
think
would
have
had
less
opposition
happened
in
this
country
happened
in
our
country
and
we
let
it
happen
going
to
turn
this
country
around
and
going
to
be
the
smart
people
not
going
to
be
the
dummies
anymore
not
going
to
be
where
china
made
last
year
trade
deficits
billion
japan
over
billion
mexico
billion
going
to
build
wall
and
mexico
is
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
okay
recently
was
in
florida
and
nice
guy
actually
you
notice
how
nice
they
are
after
defeated
them
like
everybody
defeat
but
when
ran
against
it
was
supposed
to
be
well
he
started
it
right
just
like
started
the
last
deal
he
started
it
but
came
after
me
very
viciously
you
know
he
wanted
to
be
don
right
and
it
work
but
what
happened
is
won
by
points
almost
points
and
lot
of
these
issue
we
were
talking
about
it
was
big
issues
and
frankly
wish
would
have
left
about
two
days
earlier
wanted
to
stay
in
florida
campaign
wish
would
have
devoted
two
more
days
to
ohio
because
almost
won
in
ohio
would
have
won
in
ohio
but
want
to
take
chance
leaving
my
beautiful
florida
because
love
florida
and
wanted
to
win
that
so
if
would
have
left
couple
of
days
early
think
would
have
won
florida
the
same
but
not
going
to
have
anything
happen
in
we
have
to
win
if
we
look
we
have
to
put
these
politicians
in
their
place
folks
time
and
believe
me
you
know
likes
to
pretend
an
outsider
and
in
the
meantime
he
gets
all
the
establishment
support
including
your
governor
so
believe
me
believe
me
all
establishment
and
frankly
in
way
worse
because
is
establishment
and
yet
got
no
relationship
with
the
establishment
he
goes
and
he
stands
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
for
day
and
half
and
he
and
these
senators
look
know
tough
cookies
have
the
best
have
one
of
the
great
people
sessions
great
nobody
better
than
and
you
know
thought
he
was
going
to
have
him
and
used
him
in
his
sessions
and
then
he
comes
out
and
he
endorses
me
but
when
you
think
of
it
look
out
of
all
of
these
senators
he
has
one
supporter
lee
his
friend
mean
his
friend
and
by
the
way
took
him
plenty
time
to
do
it
but
you
know
to
stand
there
and
to
rant
and
rave
for
two
days
to
show
people
you
can
filibuster
in
the
meantime
nothing
was
accomplished
has
not
accomplished
one
thing
so
an
insider
but
almost
like
the
man
on
the
street
because
he
get
anything
done
he
dislikes
people
he
calls
people
like
for
instance
he
said
horrible
things
about
the
speaker
and
you
know
about
the
speaker
and
he
said
about
separately
mean
he
said
some
terrible
things
about
how
do
you
get
things
done
when
calling
bad
names
okay
just

they

on
lots
of

but
and
actually
very
conservative
on
trade
but
lot
of
people
would
say
not
that
conservative
on
trade
because
he
believe
in
free
trade
well
actually
do
believe
in
free
trade
but
got
to
be
good
trade
for
us
right
got
to
be
smart
trade
it
be
where
is
losing
thousands
and
thousands
of
jobs
where
you
folks
get
into
china
but
china
comes
in
here
like
swiss
cheese
what
happens
you
know
china
does
not
obey
the
rules
now
get
along
great
with
china
made
fortune
dealing
with
china
have
two
buildings
because
of
china
big
ones
in
new
york
and
one
in
san
bank
of
america
that
have
in
partnership
with
great
company
and
because
of
china
sell
have
one
of
the
big
leases
with
one
of
their
big
banks
with
the
biggest
bank
in
the
world
actually
from
china
sell
millions
of
millions
of
to
people
from
china
like
china
not
angry
china
like
them
think
their
leaders
are
doing
great
job
for
them
but
our
leaders
are
doing
bad
job
for
us
same
with
mexico
get
along
great
the
love
the
love
the
but
their
leaders
are
killing
us
on
the
border
and
killing
us
on
trade
and
not
angry
at
them
angry
at
our
country
and
our
leadership
because
grossly
incompetent
and
going
to
change
it
around
and
going
to
get
the
best
and
going
to
get
the
finest
so
whatever
you
can
do
to
spread
the
world
be
around
going
to
green
bay
love
their
team
by
the
way
you
talk
about
great
franchise
no
love
it
and
you
have
truly
great
quarterback
know
probably
endorsing
somebody
else
but
care
still
great
quarterback
friend
of
mine
he
said
you
have
great
quarterback
all
right
with
me
when
says
great
quarterback
pretty
good
but
you
know
really
want
to
win
because
if
we
could
win
going
to
put
all
of
this
stupidity
away
going
to
put
these
stupid
stupid
people
that
allow
and
talking
about
basically
politicians
and
in
many
cases
you
know
lot
of
times
people
will
see
deals
that
are
done
and
mean
take
look
at
the
iran
deal
how
bad
is
that
mean
just
as
deal
but
many
times
people
will
say
deals
that
the
country
makes
and
say
how
can
our
politicians
be
so
stupid
not
stupid
being
hit
by
the
lobbyists
and
the
special
interests
and
they
make
fortune
okay
they
get
tremendous
campaign
contributions
not
stupid
doing
it
for
themselves
so
again
not
doing
that
doing
for
you
working
for
you
but
just
remember
not
so
stupid
like
you
think
but
when
you
look
at
the
people
funding
campaign
and
campaign
and
you
look
forget
said
oh
the
banks
the
banks
you
know
going
to
be
robin
hood
going
to
be
this
great
guy
and
then
in
her
personal
financial
disclosure
form
he
forgot
to
mention
that
he
borrowed
about
million
dollars
from
the
banks
and
he
borrowed
million
dollars
at
an
interest
rate
that
everybody
in
this
room
would
be
proud
to
have
very
low
interest
rate
almost
no
interest
he
forgot
to
announce
it
on
his
personal
financial
disclosure
form
he
just
forgot
he
said
oh
forgot
forgot
okay
so
then
he
hits
the
banks
controlled
by
these
people
folks
okay
mean
what
he
did
was
absolutely
wrong
but
controlled
by
these
people
controlled
by
you
going
to
do
the
right
thing
for
you
okay
so
remember
that
veterans
day
commit
suicide
correct
going
to
take
care
of
our
veterans
so
much
look
let
me
tell
you
they
many
of
them
kill
themselves
waiting
for
doctor
they
even
get
to
see
the
doctor
you
know
that
they
end
up
killing
themselves
before
they
see
the
doctor
day
and
lot
of
people
even
believe
that
number
they
think
almost
like
an
impossible
number
how
can
it
be
so
bad
and
it
actually
could
be
even
worse
than
that
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
them
from
their
standpoint
they
wait
they
wait
then
they
get
bad
service
then
they
wait
some
more
six
seven
eight
days
and
sometimes
see
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
says
see
you
now
going
on
vacation
you
see
the
just
left
phoenix
people
sheriff
was
there
the
job
he
did
was
incredible
incredible
you
know
they
had
little
protest
right
that
protest
ended
so
quickly
he
arrested
three
people
everyone
else
scattered
you
know
and
you
have
that
kind
of
sheriff
here
you
have
tough
here
can
tell
you
just
met
him
and
can
tell
you
but
you
know
have
great
policy
plan
and
gotten
lot
of
credit
for
it
and
on
and
with
the
veterans
when
waiting
for
exorbitant
time
even
for
little
time
going
to
go
to
the
doctor
going
to
go
to
local
doctors
or
local
hospitals
many
of
the
hospitals
are
dying
for
business
you
know
that
dying
some
of
these
hospitals
are
dying
going
to
get
immediate
treatment
immediate
service
going
to
pay
the
bills
and
going
to
save
fortune
and
going
to
get
great
service
and
everybody
is
in
love
with
it
everybody
loves
it
and
going
to
happen
so
going
to
take
care
of
our
veterans
if
we
take
care
of
our
veterans
we
take
care
of
anyone
so
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
boy
do
you
look
good
though
you
look
good
and
tough
want
to
fight
you
do
you
think
can
take
you
in
fight
think
so
how
about
we
do
it
right
now
that
would
be
great
for
television
go
ahead
let
me
tell
you
this
our
veterans
are
taken
worse
care
of
than
illegal
immigrants
who
come
in
our
country
you
even
have
to
write
it
down
going
to
do
things
about
it
you
know
what
saying
heard
this
so
many
times
before
with
the
daycare
and
everything
else
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
by
the
ways
speaking
of
increase
and
want
to
destroy
your
social
security
folks
okay
want
to
bring
money
back
into
this
country

to
bring
tremendous
wealth
into
this
country
want
to
take
our
wealth
back
from
china
from
mexico
from
all
of
these
countries
that
have
our
wealth
taken
them
like
bunch
of
babies
and
going
to
save
your
social
security
and
going
to
save
your
they
want
to
get
rid
of
it
okay
remember
that
want
to
use
not
too
many
executive
orders
folks
you
know
because
executive
orders
came
about
more
recently
nobody
ever
heard
of
an
executive
order
then
all
of
sudden
because
he
get
anybody
to
agree
with
him
and
he
start
signing
them
like
butter
so
want
to
do
away
with
executive
orders
for
the
most
part
but
look
just
do
me
stick
with
me
going
to
be
okay
all
right
know
what
said
heard
hundred
times
and
daycare

huge
problem

problem
and
your
wife
not
working
huge
problem

great
wife

believe
it
ending
common
core
not
going
to
be
educated
your
kids
in
are
no
longer
going
to
be
educated
in
washington
by
bureaucrats
many
of
whom
say
all
but
many
of
whom
care
for
your
kids
they
care
less
they
get
big
fat
salaries
your
kids
are
going
to
be
educated
locally
terminating
common
core
and
you
will
see
something
magic
and
seen
it
where
parents
and
all
of
these
people
the
uncles
the
aunts
all
on
the
school
boards
they
get
professionals
they
have
great
principals
you
see
going
on
from
washington
many
of
the
people
never
even
come
here
they
sit
behind
their
desk
in
washington
they
draw
big
salaries
and
telling
you
how
to
educate
their
kids
not
going
to
happen
that
way
and
even
seen
it
where
they
keep
graduates
the
child
graduates
and
those
parents
stay
on
they
love
it
because
their
child
went
through
the
system
they
love
it
and
they
become
so
good
at
it
going
to
happen
one
of
the
worst
in
the
world
in
education
going
to
be
one
of
the
better
ones
not
necessarily
you
know
know
that
going
to
beat
sweden
norway
denmark
and
china
but
going
to
come
very
close
discipline
in

that
should
have
big
problem
with
discipline
you

so
nice
thank
you
have
to
go
down

say
hello

be
really
story
of
hope
and
something
that
is
really
great
is
going
to
happen
out
of
that
you
watch
but
it
sort
of
tells
me
when
first
said
this
people
would
say
oh

will
cost
lot
forgetting
about
the
campaign
peanuts
by
comparison
you
know
spent
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
but
the
big
thing
lost
certain
businesses
and
owned
the
miss
universe
pageant
bought
it
very
inexpensively
many
years
ago
years
ago
and
because
of
the
fact
that
they
thought
was
against
this
woman
or
that
one
had
hard
time
with
television
now
the
good
news
is
sold
it
for
wonderful
was
very
happy
with
that
but
want
to
sell
it

sold
it
and
built
it
to
really
great
company
we
did
great
job
with
that
company
miss
universe
miss
miss
teen
but
other
businesses

of
like
the

unbelievably
disloyal

of
illegal
immigration

about
eminent
domain
by
the
way
without
eminent
domain
you
have
highways
you
have
hospitals
you
have
bridges
you
need
eminent
domain
if
in
your
way
and
building
highway
if
producing
jobs
and
you
need
little
corner
of
property
every
once
in
while
you
know
funny
these
guys
all
want
the
keystone
pipeline
right
everyone
conservatives
conservatives
want
the
keystone
pipeline
like
the
keystone
pipeline
too
but
they
have
whole
big
thing
on
eminent
domain
in
their
prospectus
because
without
eminent
domain
they
go
feet
they
be
able
to
build
it
so
they
want
eminent
domain
they
do
commercials
about
eminent
domain
they
love
the
keystone
pipeline
and
the
whole
keystone
pipeline
is
based
around
eminent
domain
because
got
to
go
from
canada
where
was
born
to
texas
where
representing
think
of
it
this
guy
and
forget
that
remember
what
said
going
to
win
just
remember
what
said
going
to
win
and
thank
you
going
to
win
but
remember
this
if
for
some
reason
he
does
he
gets
the
nomination
the
first
thing
remember
good
good
predictor
the
first
thing
going
to
happen
is
the
democrats
are
going
to
sue
ted
he
was
born
in
canada
he
lived
there
for
four
years
the
head
of
the
harvard
law
school
one
of
the
top
people
in
the
business
in
terms
of
constitution
is
saying
that
you
know
wrong
and
we
have
bunch
of
other
people
that
are
much
stronger
than
even
that
remember
this
if
gets
lucky
and
wins
and
the
only
way
he
can
get
lucky
is
if
he
get
because
all
establishment
you
know
if
go
into
that
whole
mess
of
the
convention
not
the
establishment
take
their
money
hire
their
people
do
any
of
that
stuff
okay
so
you
have
disadvantage
but
if
wins
remember
what
said
just
remember
again
not
going
to
win
but
if
he
does
he
gets
the
nomination
within
the
first
few
days
he
will
be
sued
by
the
democrats
that
he
have
the
right
to
be
president
and
think
right
because
he
born
on
our
soil
he
born
not
natural
born
citizen
not
natural
born
citizen
like
to
make
big
deal
of
this
but
it
was
just
brought
up
by
somebody
he
is
not
natural
born
citizen
so
if
for
some
reason
he
should
get
the
nomination
really
believe
wasting
your
time
and
boy
do
we
have
problem
because
going
to
have
somebody
going
to
be
sued
probably
will
lose
the
lawsuit
again
he
was
born
there
lived
there
for
four
years
mother
was
there
the
whole
thing
for
long
period
of
time
and
he
was
canadian
citizen
joint
with
until
or
months
ago
did
anyone
know
that
so
he
was
senator
from
texas
only
because
of
the
great
by
the
way
without
he
could
have
never
won
that
election
it
was
fluke
but
he
was
senator
from
texas
he
lived
he
was
joint
citizen
now
he
finally
gave
up
his
citizenship
to
canada
like
months
ago
he
said
oh
know
was
citizen
of
canada
also
just
like
he
know
that
and
gave
him
money
mean
this
guy
is
you
just
have
to
study
him
folks
look
again
doing
this
going
to
win
going
to
turn
this
country

and
that
was
very
nice
start
to
the
day
that
can
tell
you
many
things
have
been
happening
over
the
last
short
period
of
time
was
very
nice
they
came
up
with
poll
the
poll
said
to
and
we
just
had
one
from
the
economist
just
came
out
and
it
was
sort
of
interesting
because
was
watching
the
news
little
while
ago
and
one
of
the
commentators
who
not
particularly
fond
of
but
these
are
minor
details
said
but
trump
get
over
because
at
actually
now
according
to
the
economist
at
and
have
to
explain
to
these
people
they
understand
basic
physics
basic
mathematics
basic
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
when
get
over
we
have
four
people
right
we
have
four
people
do
you
understand
that
so
when
get
and
this
one
is
an
example
had
and
with
four
people
an
achievement
just
mathematically
when
you
can
get
over
so
someday
someday
going
to
understand
someday
when
we
take
it
all
understand
but
it
is
really
ridiculous
want
to
thank
my
family
my
boy

don
been
working
so
hard
and
have
been
amazing
home

now
in
about
two
minutes
call

about
to
have
baby
so
know
been
thinking
about
that
now
for
little
while
but
has
been
so
helpful
and
has
been
amazing
and
been
just
great
want
to
thank
for
putting
up
with
the
fact
that
never
see
him
anymore
and
want
to
thank
never
see
my
and
his
birthday
on
sunday
so
very
happy
about
that
so
little
tough
you
know
going
away
and
he
goes
when
are
you
going
to
be
come
home
daddy
when
are
you
coming
home
said
well
in
about
two
and
half
weeks
been
pretty
tough
all
over
the
place
really
amazing
yesterday
went
up
to
ohio
went
up
to
we
had
an
incredible
crowd
and
just
amazing
people
in
this
country
we
have
so
so
many
great
people
we
will
someday
in
the
not
so
distant
future
if
win
otherwise
not
going
to
happen
have
to
be
honest
with
you
but
apple
and
all
of
these
great
companies
will
be
making
their
product
in
the
united
states
not
in
china
and
all
of
and
not
going
to
be
losing
our
companies
you
know
our
companies
are
leaving
our
country
rapidly
rapidly
whether
carrier
air
conditioning
whether
ford
whether
was
in
and
leaving
and
so
many
companies
are
leaving
and
frankly
disgusted
with
it
and
tired
of
seeing
it
and
no
reason
for
it
just
gross
incompetence
at
the
highest
level
we
should
not
allow
it
to
happen
great
company
pharmaceutical
company
going
to
ireland
and
so
many
more
you
have
corporate
inversions
you
have
people
who
get
their
money
back
into
the
country
because
the
politicians
get
along
they
make
deal
everybody
agrees
democrat
and
republican
everybody
agrees
the
money
should
come
back
trillion
dollars
outside
of
this
country
everybody
agrees
that
the
money
should
be
here
and
the
politicians
for
three
years
been
able
to
make
deal
and
we
could
make
deal
an
example
of
something
that
you
could
do
if
sat
down
with
few
of
the
senators
few
of
the
congressmen
you
could
make
deal
on
that
in
minutes
if
you
know
what
doing
because
everybody
wants
to
do
it
and
companies
are
actually
leaving
our
country
to
get
their
money
not
only
because
our
taxes
are
too
high
which
going
to
lower
by
the
way
but
companies
are
leaving
our
country
in
order
to
go
and
get
money
their
money
because
no
way
of
bringing
it
in
so
got
long
way
to
go
but
think
at
some
point
going
to
get
done
this
has
been
very
exciting
this
whole
process
we
started
was
one
of
people
senators
governors
had
such
great
support
ben
the
other
day
endorsed
us
great
guy
great
guy
wonderful
man
and
endorsed
us
that
was
so
incredible
and
today
came
up
and
endorsed
us
she
was
great
she
is
truly
wonderful
woman
of
the
job
done
in
florida
is
incredible
you
know
so
many
had
such
incredible
support
paul
called
me
the
other
day
tremendous
call
spoke
with
today
we
had
great
conversation
the
fact
is
we
have
to
bring
our
party
together
we
have
to
bring
it
together
we
have
something
happening
that
actually
makes
the
republican
party
probably
the
biggest
political
story
anywhere
in
the
world
writing
about
it
all
over
europe
all
over
the
world
talking
about
it
millions
of
people
are
coming
in
to
vote
this
was
an
example
of
it
today
many
many
more
people
looking
at
the
polling
booths
looking
at
the
different
polling
booths
all
around
the
country
where
up
and
the
lines
are
four
five
six
blocks
long
and
the
woman
one
woman
was
there
for
years
been
working
the
polls
and
she
said
have
two
people
here
have
three
people
now
look
at
the
line
and
the
line
looked
like
it
was
you
know
long
it
was
really
long
five
deep
and
long
and
just
different
thing
we
have
great
opportunity
and
the
people
that
are
voting
are
democrats
are
coming
in
independents
are
coming
in
and
very
very
importantly
people
that
never
voted
before
an
incredible
thing
want
to
pay
my
respects
by
the
way
to
husband
was
here
she
was
incredible
she
was
making
on
my
behalf
and
fantastic
and
everybody
loves
her
and
what
happened
is
he
was
in
very
bad
accident
tough
as
nails
going
to
be
fine
but
just
wanted
to
pay
my
respects
by
the
way
to

our
theme
when
we
started
and
and
came
down
yeah

is
we
give
you
seats
you
have

we
have
to
do
it
we
came
down
the
escalator
and
it
was
about
trade
and
it
was
about
borders
and
what
happened
is
pretty
quickly
after
that
and
we
were
we
shot
right
up
shot
right
to
the
top
of
the
polls
and
have
been
leading
in
the
polls
almost
from
the
beginning
without
fail
we
went
up
in
june
most
people
said
never
run
just
going
to
have
fun
having
good
time
this
necessarily
mean
having
good
time
you
know
having
very
nice
time
but
you
know
what
working
very
hard
and
there
is
great
anger
believe
me
there
is
great
anger
one
of
the
broadcasters
was
saying
is
there
anger
and
said

supposed
to
say
no
not

love
all
the
deals

year
in
terms
of
imbalance

want
to
see
the
country
properly
run
they
want
to
see
borders
they
want
to
see
good
health
care
they
want
to
see
things
properly
taken
care
of
they
want
our
military
rebuilt
our
military
is
in
very
bad
state
they
want
it
rebuilt
very
very
importantly
and
they
want
the
second
amendment
by
the
way
protected
and
protected
strongly
and
going
to
happen
and
you
know
what
they
want
so
badly
they
want
our
veterans
taken
care
of
our
veterans
are
treated
so
badly
so
we
started
and
something
happened
called
paris
paris
happened
and
paris
was
disaster
that
was
there
have
been
many
disasters
but
it
was
paris
and
then
we
had
case
in
where
it
was
in
california
where
the
young
people
were
killed
and
it
just
goes
on
and
on
and
on
and
what
happened
with
me
is
this
whole
run
took
on
whole
new
meaning
not
just
borders
not
just
good
trade
deals
going
to
make
the
best
trade
deals
ever
seen
got
such
endorsements
from
and
the
smartest
people
in
business
and
these
people
are
going
to
be
negotiating
our
deals
and
the
best
in
the
world
we
have
the
best
business
people
in
the
world
going
to
have
such
great
deals
going
to
do
so
good
with
trade
going
to
do
so
good
on
the
border
but
it
took
on
whole
new
meaning
and
the
meaning
was
very
simple
we
need
protection
in
our
country
and
going
to
happen
and
all
of
sudden
the
poll
numbers
shot
up
and
just
very
proud
to
be
part
of
this
think
going
to
go
going
to
go
on
lot
of
trips
over
the
next
month
but
think
going
to
have
great
victory
and
think
more
importantly
than
anything
else
we
are
going
to
start
winning
again
this
country
is
going
to
start
winning
again
we
win
anymore
we
win
with
our
military
we
beat
isis
going
to
knock
the
hell
out
of
them
we
win
at
trade
china
everybody
japan
mexico
india
name
the
country
anybody
we
deal
anybody
we
do
business
with
beats
us
we
win
at
trade
going
to
win
at
trade
going
to
make
our
country
rich
again
going
to
make
our
country
great
again
and
we
need
the
rich
in
order
to
make
the
great
sorry
to
tell
you
so
going
forward
we
had
fantastic
evening
would
have
never
thought
this
could
have
happened
guess
waiting
for
one
result
which
possibly
will
be
very
successful
also
but
to
win
the
states
that
won
and
to
win
by
the
margins
and
especially
look
this
is
my
second
home
florida
to
win
by
that
kind
of
number
is
incredible
and
have
to
say
that
number
one
want
to
congratulate
on
having
run
really
tough
campaign
tough
smart
and
got
great
future
got
great
future
but
have
to
say
and
nobody
has
ever
ever
in
the
history
of
politics
received
the
kind
of
negative
advertising
that
have
record
record
record
by
the
way
mostly
false
say
but
about
mostly
false
vicious
horrible
they
said
it
was
million
the
first
week
meaning
last
week
and
million
it
added
up
to
over
million
and
you
explain
it
to
me
because
my
numbers
went
up
understand
it
nobody
understands
it
my
numbers
went
up
mean
been
an
interesting
experience
last
week
adam
won
at
the
trump
national
won
the
big
tournament
the
world
championship
of
golf
and
adam
great
guy
guess
lot
of
you
folks
saw
that
but
watching
we
have
television
screens
all
over
down
at
this
gorgeous
green
at
and
everything
is
working
beautifully
and
then
commercial
comes
on
the
worst
commercial
and
with
these
wonderful
people
from
and
all
these
top
executives
and
saying
look
over
there
look
watch
it
you
want
to
watch
it
saying
the
grass
beautiful
look
look
watch
and
they
came
in
waves
one
after
another
after
another
and
it
was
brutal
and
then
adam
comes
in
this
handsome
kid
from
one
of
the
greatest
golfers
in
the
world
made
an
unbelievable
shot
on
the
hole
to
win
the
tournament
great
champion
and
giving
the
award
and
just
before
we
break
for
commercial
be
right
back
with
our
great
champion
from
adam

the
commercial
and
said
no
and
it
was
two
of
them

of
them
oh

day
that
was
what
disaster

disaster
unbelievable
so
again
just
want
to
congratulate
everybody
this
is
really
interesting
process
an
amazing
process
very
tough
but
it
is
by
the
end
if
you
get
to
the
end
you
can
handle
lot
of
things
including
pressure
because
nothing
like
it
lies
deceit
viciousness
disgusting
reporters
horrible
people
true
some
are
nice
some
are
nice
some
really
disgusting
people
back
there
and
just
want
to
say
going
to
go
forward
and
going
to
win
but
more
importantly
going
to
win
for
the
country
going
to
win
win
win
and
not
stopping
going
to
have
great
victories
for
our
country
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
so
so
important
you
getting
out
to
vote
just
so
important
because
our
country
has
been
taken
away
from
us
going
so
fast
and
you
know
talking
about
second
amendment
because
was
asking
with
randy
and
lot
of
people
was
talking
to
some
of
the
people
before
what
would
you
like
me
to
focus
on
and
they
said
just
second
amendment
second
amendment
now
the
second
amendment
means
lot
of
other
things
too
the
second
amendment
in
under
siege
you
know
that
you
know
that
very
well
we
lost
great
supreme
court
justice
and
nobody
thought
this
was
going
to
be
part
of
the
equation
and
all
of
sudden
if
somebody
gets
in
the
wrong
person
take
away
that
second
amendment
so
fast
your
head
will
spin
you
see
is
somebody
that
wants
to
knock
out
the
second
amendment
is
disaster
on
the
second
amendment
no
they
want
to
take
it
away
so
just
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
but
we
lost
our
wonderful
justice
who
was
great
man
and
great
second
amendment
person
just
heard
coming
up
you
know
the
senators
been
very
disappointed
republican
many
of
you
are
republicans
but
not
being
protected
whether
budget
you
saw
the
budget
that
was
approved
month
ago
it
was
approved
by
the
republicans
they
gave
it
away
they
gave
everything
so
wants
to
put
in
supreme
court
judge
he
said
he
wants
going
to
be
very
negative
person
to
guns
because
the
way
it
is
okay
believe
me
that
will
be
the
way
it
is
and
basically
they
have
the
right
to
do
that
but
keep
saying
well
are
the
republicans
going
to
fail
or
are
they
going
to
crack
going
to
happen
and
coming
up
today
hear
well
there
could
be
way
of
pushing
it
through
here
we
go
right
here
we
go
same
thing
you
heard
with
going
to
be
defeated
going
to
be
repealed
going
to
repeal
and
replace
believe
me
but
mean
look
going
on
with
your
premiums
up
your
deductible
is
so
high
mean
got
to
see
that
truck
right
there
got
to
get
hit
by
that
truck
in
order
to
ever
use
it
so
come
up
and
hearing
that
now
who
said
by
the
way
yesterday
trump
will
not
be
the
president
he
will
not
be
no
compliment
look
been
perhaps
the
worst
president
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
so
compliment
but
he
was
all
over
the
place
yesterday
said
trump
will
not
be
think
we
have
maybe
little
surprise
in
store
and
we
start
right
here
in
south
you
know
new
was
so
amazing
we
had
big
big
victory
in
new
amazing
people
and
then
we
come
down
here
and
said
you
know
think
we
have
an
ever
bigger
lead
over
here
and
the
people
have
been
incredible
no
matter
where
we
go
to
speak
even
this
know
that
four
years
ago
you
had
about
people
here
for
the
same
kind
of
thing
for
your
and
good
good
guy
and
he
did
well
but
you
had
people
people
you
have
thousands
of
people
here
and
we
just
appreciate
it
and
forget
it
believe
me
not
going
to
forget
it
not
going
to
forget
it
so
hear
that
talking
about
trying
to
get
liberal
judge
and
judge
that
does
not
like
the
second
amendment
and
judge
that
and
this
is
one
of
many
this
is
one
of
many
but
judge
that
want
to
do
number
on
the
guns
and
that
know
how
important
it
is
just
not
going
to
let
it
happen
okay
not
going
happen
and
if
we
elected
we
know
that
but
we
have
months
months
to
go
we
have
to
have
the
republicans
hold
fast
because
just
hearing
these
little
cracks
saying
well
maybe
if
he
appoints
somebody
maybe
we
could
get
along
maybe
not
the
way
supposed
to
be
now
possible
that
have
their
wish
because
if
they
win
going
to
be
having
their
choice
but
if
they
win
going
to
start
really
taking
back
because
we
have
or
or
maybe
supreme
court
judges
this
was
not
supposed
to
be
one
in
question
this
was
very
sad
circumstance
that
happened
with
mean
really
to
me
it
was
very
sad
circumstance
but
now
going
to
see
what
happens
will
only
tell
you
this
we
are
doing
well
we
have
really
good
chance
to
win
if
we
can
win
in
south
going
to
go
mean
we
could
very
well
run
the
table
know
if
you
saw
guess
lot
of
you
have
seen
actually
next
week
in
going
to
be
phenomenal
the
relationship
there
to
the
people
bush
is
in
this
guy
why
he
just
give
up
just
go
home
go
home
go
home
to
mom
got
to
go
home
to
you
know
bush
is
only
at
in
couple
of
them
are
you
know
at
or
at
like
something
so
think
going
to
do
well
then
think
we
have
the
sec
going
to
have
the
sec
which
is
going
to
be
think
amazing
but
really
now
starting
new
could
not
have
been
better
they
gave
us
tremendous
they
really
started
us
on
our
way
and
we
did
well
in
mean
some
votes
were
stolen
from
ben
which
by
the
way
was
disgrace
what
what
this
guy
did
with
ben
was
an
absolute
disgrace
what
he
did
was
he
stole
theft
and
then
they
come
out
with
voter
violation
form
which
is
fraud
as
far
as
concerned
and
what
he
did
with
that
whole
thing
was
disgrace
so
not
going
to
let
that
stuff
happen
anymore
mean
not
going
to
let
it
we
will
not
let
it
happen
all
watching
all
watching
keep
your
eyes
wide
open
these

yet
he
tells
fibs
he
tells
lies
and
then
he
does
this
stuff
to
and
he
does
other
things
very
bad
so
politicians
are
bad
people
boy
they
are
bad
would
you
believe
it
so
not
going
to
let
it
happen
and
going
to
get
in
there
so
saturday
go
out
and
vote
this
is
going
to
be
the
place
really
going
to
make
it
and
honestly
been
watching
all
the
pundits
now
the
bad
news
is
always
wrong
they
all
said
not
running
and
ran
well
how
is
he
going
to
do
just
doing
this
for
fun
not
doing
this
for
fun
believe
me
love
this
location
but
know
can
be
else
okay
could
be
else
right
now
could
be
very
happy
but
doing
it
because
you
know
the
expression
and
see
all
the
hats
in
the
audience
make
america
great
again
we
are
going
to
make
america
so
we
are
going
to
win
again
you
know
we
win
very
much
very
smart
tough
people
you
like
to
win
right
this
guy
over
here
you
like
to
win
and
we
win
anymore
we
used
to
win
we
win
anymore
well
going
to
start
winning
again
going
to
start
winning
again
so
second
amendment
protected
common
core
going
to
end
common
core
bringing
your
education
locally
going
to
be
fabulous
know
if
you
know
or
if
heard
me
say
we
have
the
absolute
worst
we
spend
number
one
in
the
world
on
education
right
number
one
per
pupil
in
the
world
there
is
no
second
place
because
so
high
so
much
you
have
china
you
have
norway
you
have
denmark
you
have
sweden
you
have
these
countries
are
the
best
in
terms
of
education
and
on
the
list
the
best
and
the
in
the
top
number
okay
number
one
in
costs
little
bit
like
what
doing
the
least
spent
money
you
know
funding
my
own
campaign
right
so
have
lot
of
the
people
coming
to
me
you
know
the
drug
companies
and
all
of
the
because
if
you
would
see
the
kind
of
waste
fraud
and
corruption
in
the
united
states
lot
of
it
really
waste
fraud
and
corruption
the
fact
that
people
that
are
running
against
me
and
people
in
the
senate
people
in
congress
they
have
tremendous
power
because
they
have
people
giving
them
unbelievable
campaign
contributions
and
special
interests
and
they
do
what
those
people
want
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
our
budget
is
out
of
whack
the
military
is
out
of
whack
the
military
orders
equipment
they
even
want
and
the
stuff
they
do
want
they
get
because
the
company
that
makes
that
equipment
is
like
you
know
not
politically
adept
and
companies
that
really
are
they
make
the
equipments
we
want
going
to
all
change
because
not
getting
any
money
from
all
of
these
people
give
damn
mean
going
to
do
the
right
thing
going
to
absolutely
do
the
right
thing
tell
you
little
story
so
the
drug
companies
we
are
the
largest
purchasers
of
drugs
in
the
world
the
united
states
which
makes
lot
of
sense
guess
but
we
purchase
more
drugs
that
make
you
better
drugs
that
make
you
better
not
the
kind
of
drugs
that
come
over
the
southern
border
which
going
to
end
okay
going
to
build
wall
folks
by
the
way
going
to
build
wall
and
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
audience
mexico
you
better
believe
it
we
have
trade
deficit
with
mexico
of
billion
and
these
characters
come
up
these
politicians
that
running
against
you
really
think
mexico
is
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
said
absolutely
they
said
how
are
you
going
to
get
mexico
to
pay
and
want
to
get
into
it
because
they
understand
it
mean
they
have
no
concept
of
business
they
have
no
you
know
the
billion
we
gave
to
iran
these
people
have
no
concept
we
have
billion
trade
deficit
with
mexico
okay
the
wall
is
going
to
cost
billion
maybe
less
if
build
it
be
taller
better
and
less
okay
so
you
think
of
this
so
you
think
of
this
so
they
said
how
are
you
going
to
possibly
do
it
they
make
so
much
money
plus
we
give
them
subsidy
they
make
so
much
money
from
the
united
states
going
to
be
one
of
the
easiest
things
and
know
if
heard
one
of
the
presidents
or
of
mexico
held
news
conference
he
said
we
will
never
ever
ever
pay
for
the
wall
and
the
press
called
me
they
said
they
said
they
will
never
pay
for
the
wall
said
who
was
it
very
nice
good
guy
said
tell
him
the
following
the
wall
just
got
feet
higher
mean
it

got
feet
higher
yeah
going
to
pay
for
it
and
get
along
great
with
mexico

problem
is
mean
they
buy
apartments
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
workers
are
who
doing
great
with
we
have
such
an
amazing
relationship
with

great
people
the
problem
is
the
leaders
of
mexico

too
smart
for
our
leaders

cunning
you
look
at
going

wall
street
journal
they
announced
building
it
bigger
in
another
words
doubling
down
you
know
why
nobody
does
anything
about
it
going
to
do
something
about
it
so
watched
somebody
asked
what
would
you
do
about
carrier
because
that
was
sad
case
somebody
used
their
cell
phone
and
they
were
telling
them
out
of
work
out
of
job
forget
it
over
moving
to
mexico
are
crying
grown
men
that
have
been
there
for
long
time
really
incredible
people
and
crying
and
devastated
and
they
lost
their
job
and
never
had
another
job
and
now
this
plant
this
whole
thing
is
moving
to
mexico
and
they
said
what
would
you
do
said
tell
you
what
going
to
do
because
you
know
they
talk
about
free
trade
free
trader
but
say
oh
if
put
tax
on
these
characters
these
idiots
mean
like
stupid
they
say
trump
is
not
true
conservative
because
he
taxes
got
to
be
fair
stuff
folks
got
to
be
fair
conservative
person
hey
the
most
conservative
on
the
border
the
most
conservative
with
the
military
tougher
than
me
the
most
conservative
we
are
going
to
make
our
military
so
big
so
strong
so
powerful
ever
going
to
mess
with
us
folks
we
have
to
use
it
the
most
conservative
on
taking
care
of
the
vets
our
vets
are
treated
horribly
going
to
take
care
of
our
the
most
conservative
on
common
core
ending
common
core
told
you
that
and
moving
it
locally
and
nobody
is
more
conservative
and
we
call
toughness
but
nobody
is
more
conservative
on
the
second
amendment
so
all
of
these
things
but
with
carrier
coming
across
and
going
to
build
plant
and
probably
get
some
subsidies
from
mexico
probably
probably
given
them
subsidies
they
probably
have
the
united
states
giving
subsidies
to
move
out
of
the
country
how
stupid
it
is
and
how
stupid
running
they
said
what
would
you
do
say
very
easy
we
call
them
we
say
have
meeting
the
story
folks
moving
to
mexico
congratulations
but
if
you
stay
in
the
united
states
going
to
have
problem
but
what
you
do
it
you
want
to
move
to
mexico
build
your
factory
going
to
be
wonderful
hire
your
people
not
from
the
united
states
all
those
people
are
now
looking
for
jobs
those
are
good
jobs
you
know
hiring
lot
of
now
the
numbers
are
totally
phony
the
totally
phony
numbers
so
say
what
going
to
do
very
simple
you
build
your
plant
in
mexico
enjoy
yourselves
and
going
to
have
air
conditioners
and
just
have
them
cross
the
border
and
sell
them
to
the
united
states
no
going
to
pay
tax
on
every
air
conditioner
true
the
only
thing
you
can
do
and
you
know
what
the
only
thing
you
can
do
nothing
else
because
otherwise
how
are
you
going
to
get
them
to
stop
and
then
you
have
the
devaluation
with
china
the
like
grand
chess
masters
or
grand
mean
these
people
are
the
greatest
the
greatest
in
history
grandmasters
of
that
devaluation
they
devalue
their
currency
japan
is
doing
very
well
too
killing
caterpillar
you
know
ordering

now
because
devalued
look
you
take
look
at
happened

put
in
big
order
for
not
that
he
wanted
to
he
said
they
made
it
impossible
for
me
not
to
buy
devalued
the
yen
to
such
an
extent
japan
that
it
made
it
mean
owe
it
to
my
family
to
my
company
to
myself
have
no
choice
and
he
was
like
depressed
he
wanted
to
buy
caterpillar
well
china
is
doing
that
times

and
what
doing
is
the
devaluation
of
their

impossible
for
people
to
compete

they
devalued
their

on
top
of
it
they
make
it
impossible
have
friend
great
manufacturer

said
virtually
impossible
to
get
his
goods
and
he
makes
better
stuff
than
they

them
in
tax
to
pay

no
concept
of
what
doing
they
have
no
concept
of
what
doing
political
hacks
what
they
are
political
hacks
and
these
are
the
people
that
are
negotiating
with
these
people

again
china
likewise
get
along
great
with
china
largest

the
bank
of
america
building
in
california
own
big
chunk
of
that
got
that
through
china
through
very
complex
set
of
transactions
but
through
china
mean
think
china
is
terrific
not
angry
at
china
angry
at
our
leaders
for
not
being
able
to
compete
with
china
not
angry
so
going
to
get
things
changed
around
going
to
use
our
best
people
going
to
be
so
smart
and
going
to
start
winning
again
going
to
have
strong
borders
going
to
have
strong
military
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
going
to
have
such
great
trade
deals
going
to
win
again
going
to
win
again
going
to
win
so
much
and
you
know
and
by
the
way
we
are
going
to
get
rid
of
isis
and
going
to
get
rid
of
them
fast
was
against
the
war
in
iraq
from
the
beginning
was
against
the
war
in
iraq
we
have
done
it
we
did
it
then
got
out
the
wrong
way
we
have
done
iraq
we
did
it
it
the
middle
east
exactly
if
you
go
back
you
could
see
said
going
to
totally
the
middle
east
because
you
had
iran
and
iraq
and
they
were
the
same
militarily
fight
fight
fight
boom
then
rest
then
fight
fight
fight
for
years
and
years
and
years
we
decapitated
iraq
and
now
iran
is
taking
over
not
only
do
they
get
the
billion
maybe
the
worst
transaction
ever
seen
negotiated
no
no
buy
the
famous
administration
the
worst
one
of
the
dumbest
deals
ever
seen
mean
we
get
nothing
we
get
nothing
we
should
have
gotten
those
hostages
before
we
started
even
negotiating
not
now
we
should
have
gotten
them
years
ago
but
if
you
look
at
going
on
and
now
on
top
of
that
we
gave
them
iraq
because
iran
is
now
taking
over
iraq
just
taking
them
over
so
what
we
did
we
spent
trillion
thousands
of
lives
lost
wounded
warriors
who
we
all
love
all
over
the
place
the
best
people
most
incredible
tougher
than
all
of
us
these
people
mean
what
gone
through
so
the
wounded
warriors
all
over
the
place
you
know
what
we
have
we
have
nothing
we
have
nothing
we
have
absolutely
nothing
so
what
going
to
do
going
to
change
things
around
going
to
be
smart
and
we
have
do
what
we
have
to
do
in
terms
of
isis
and
all
but
we
have
to
start
rebuilding
our
country
we
have
trillion
in
the
various
places
trillion
not
going
to
happen
anymore
going
to
have
strong
military
but
going
to
have
to
rebuild
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
schools

vote
thank
you
we
love
you
all
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
folks
really
think
look
what
happened
is
we
had
candidates
originally
was
expected
to
come
in
like
anywhere
maybe
ended
up
coming
in
second
devote
tremendous
time
to
it
devote
tremendous
money
to
it
in
fact
guess
in
terms
of
money
per
vote
about
at
the
bottom
meaning
the
most
efficient
came
in
second
came
into
strong
second
third
think
was
quite
bit
away
think
or
something
close
to
votes
away
big
difference
between
second
and
third
think
we
did
really
well
you
know
as
far
as
concerned
think
the
press
some
of
the
press
said
did
well
some
of
the
press
want
to
give
it
credit
think
we
did
very
well
expect
to
do
so
well
guess
what
did
happen
is
one
poll
came
out
and
said
or
points
ahead
and
that
maybe
build
up
false
expectation
for
some
people
but
it
had
taken
me
back
to
june
was
told
even
go
to
start
right
here
in
new
just
waste
your
going
to
went
bonded
with
the
people
bonded
with
evangelicals
we
did
really
and
came
very
close
to
winning
mean
we
came
very
close
to
winning
we
came
in
second
place
so
am
very
happy
with
what
happened
in
you
know
you
had
people
and
was
second
now
guess
you
have
people
and
was
second
and
think
we
did
very
good
job
no
think
feel
any
pressure
mean
going
to
just
do
what
have
to
do
and
if
it
works
out
great
and
if
it
okay
too
because
you
know
here
to
do
one
thing
the
theme
make
america
great
again
going
to
do
it
and
think
we
did
very
well
think
we
did
really
well
in
just
about
everything
done
running
for
office
think
we
have
very
good
result
yesterday
it
could
have
been
little
bit
better
it
could
have
been
one
notch
better
but
interesting
all
of
these
governors
and
senators
that
you
have
way
down
the
list
at
you
know
in
terms
of
what
happened
what
just
happened
at
at
nobody
ever
talks
about
them
and
at
or
and
they
say
oh
you
have
done
better
you
know
think
the
result
was
quite
good
especially
for
the
amount
of
time
spent
and
for
the
amount
of
money
spent
well
think
have
think
it
fits
me
better
probably
suits
me
better
done
very
well
in
new
been
here
lot
more
have
very
good
relationships
with
the
people
of
new
but
had
very
good
relationships
with
pretty
much
everybody
really
really
see
that
happening
know
going
to
happen
you
nobody
does
see
what
have
many
many
people
that
doing
very
well
am
doing
very
well
but
you
have
many
many
people
that
are
here
that
are
politicians
governors
and
senators
but
not
doing
very
well
and
they
just
came
back
from
you
know
very
major
defeat
yesterday
and
mine
you
know
very
interesting
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
from
yesterday
got
the
highest
number
in
history
outside
the
one
number
in
the
history
of
the
primary
also
guess
they
had
people
which
is
or
people
more
than
they
ever
had
no
mean
think
get
lot
of
voters
you
know
very
much
into
the
trade
world
and
the
best
on
trade
he
mentions
it
but
think
going
to
be
capable
of
doing
anything
about
it
no
think
going
to
do
really
well
here
look
forward
to
it
we
have
lot
of
events
scheduled
yes
well
we
do
we
have
one
commitment
for
arkansas
actually
where
going
to
have
about
people
but
going
to
be
back
and
forth
very
quickly
going
to
have
lot
of
events
scheduled
yes
well
just
think
you
know
just
happy
with
the
way
doing
you
know
bonded
with
the
people
whether
there
or
here
mean
just
big
bonding
process
going
on
if
you
look
at
south
the
same
thing
mean
doing
really
well
there
but
devoted
much
more
time
here
and
south
not
question
of
learning
mean
just
want
to
continue
to
do
well
our
theme
the
theme
is
so
important
just
make
america
great
again
what
going
to
do
what
going
to
do
not
really
question
of
learning
well
if
you
look
at
the
second
place
people
talk
about
my
second
place
they
talk
about
it
as
positively
as
they
should
have
and
yet
with
who
was
more
than
votes
behind
me
lot
of
votes
by
the
way
they
said
oh
surging
surging
so
know
why
is
the
third
place
person
doing
well
and
the
second
place
person
who
by
the
way
has
never
run
was
mentioning
before
one
of
the
amazing
things
about
you
never
run
for
office
before
incredible
how
you
did
my
doing
great
yeah
no
think
just
work
going
to
work
very
hard
and
we
have
lot
of
meetings
lot
of
talks
lot
of
speeches
going
to
be
meeting
with
lot
of
people
and
think
going
to
do
very
well
well
be
doing
some
of
that
but
we
also
have
some
very
big
events
planned
like
tonight
think
they
have
or
people
and
other
people
were
here
yesterday
and
they
had
people
same
venue
same
everything
they
had
people
so
we
have
good
bonding
going
on
well
enjoyed
it
have
unlimited
have
unlimited
you
know
funny
when
look
at
the
various
people
they
said
so
and
so
has
million
have
unlimited
not
the
thing
the
only
you
know
want
to
spend
wisely
and
probably
million
under
budget
because
of
the
fact
that
frankly
had
to
spend
very
much
although
guess
we
just
did
recent
filing
and
would
be
probably
having
spent
now
maybe
million
million
but
and
must
tell
you
know
that
enough
people
appreciate
it
anyway
whether
they
appreciate
it
or
not
so
be
influenced
by
the
lobbies
and
you
know
but
know
was
talking
to
about
this
before
know
really
appreciated
by
the
voters
the
only
one
on
both
sides
self
funding
putting
up
my
own
money
and
know
that
the
voters
appreciate
it
when
they
go
into
vote
think
they
say
going
to
vote
for
trump
because
and
not
going
to
be
influenced
by
lobbies
and
special
interests
going
to
tell
them
and
tell
them
but
sometimes
they
like
it
but
think
something
they
vote
for
which
is
shame
because
actually
very
big
thing
you
understand
that
very
big
thing
very
big
element
if
you
could
have
somebody
that
can
actually
and
not
be
influenced
by
bad
decisions
or
looking
for
themselves
or
looking
for
the
company
or
country
they
represent
real
positive
just
know
whether
or
not
the
voters
appreciate
it
learned
that
great
people
really
thought
the
people
in
were
fantastic
you
know
obviously
was
second
had
the
largest
vote
getting
in
the
history
of
republican
primary
except
for
one
and
brought
many
of
those
extra
people
in
and
they
also
had
as
you
know
the
largest
turnout
in
the
history
of
republican
primaries
in
terms
of
by
far
not
even
close
think
it
was
like
or
more
than
ever
had
before
so
just
learned
that
they
are
terrific
people
in
yeah
look
forward
to
it
no
think
so
have
very
good
relationship
with
like
him
see
that
necessarily
talking
about
well
that
could
have
been
with
the
debate
think
it
could
have
been
the
debate
think
some
people
were
disappointed
that
go
in
the
debate
if
had
to
do
it
again
would
have
done
the
exact
same
thing
and
the
reason
is
you
know
why
because
raised
million
for
the
vets
in
one
hour
so
if
took
second
place
instead
of
first
place
and
could
give
the
vets
million
do
that
all
day
long
well
going
to
be
spending
money
going
to
be
spending
money
going
to
be
spending
lot
of
money
be
spending
money
on
and
be
spending
money
on
the
ground
game
help
it
honey
whether
celebrity
mean
this
is
me
look
think
most
people
say
did
great
job
in
came
in
second
spent
far
less
than
anybody
else
and
had
known
that
was
going
to
be
liked
as
much
as
am
in
and
people
did
like
me
you
will
understand
that
would
have
maybe
spent
little
bit
more
and
would
have
been
there
little
bit
more
and
maybe
would
have
won
it
but
you
know
very
happy
with
it
have
delegates
right
at
the
top
you
look
at
other
people
in
all
fairness
senators
governors
you
know
way
down
when
have
or
and
they
have
but
you
people
mention
that
but
the
one
thing
is
you
people
mention
that
you
mention
all
the
other
names
now
you
mention
the
person
good
guy
but
he
came
in
third
and
they
make
it
sound
like
he
had
victory
and
but
came
in
second
started
off
on
was
when
first
started
had
nothing
and
then
inched
my
way
up
went
pretty
rapidly
actually
and
now
leading
everything
and
did
okay
in
pretty
good
in
well
think
going
to
have
great
success
here
think
much
different
kind
of
process
this
process
this
is
much
different
this
is
normal
voting
process
the
is
much
different
kind
of
thing
well
he
referring
to
ted
insulted
me
mean
he
started
with
the
insults
as
you
know
and
he
insulted
ben
by
doing
what
he
did
to
ben
that
was
disgrace
and
he
insulted
the
people
of
by
doing
voter
violation
form
that
ever
seen
before
which
was
disgraceful
no
no
man
of
insult
no
going
have
thousands
of
people
going
no
but
we
have
that
invite
like
mike
but
no
think
even
going
to
be
there
did
did
no
like
him
well
left
the
race
so
feel
pretty
good
about
that
good
man
well
adding
some
and
adding
them
pretty
rapidly
people
in
your
world
are
saying
they
possibly
could
so
really
see
one
or
two
see
there
could
be
number
love
to
finish
first
you
know
again
it
would
still
not
be
horrible
because
competing
against
lot
of
very
talented
people
that
have
been
politicians
all
their
lives
have
been
politician
for
months
no
but
love
to
finish
first
horrible
but
you
know
it
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
could
think
of
worse
things
but
like
to
finish
first
think
we
will
finish
first
like
to
finish
first
just
so
you
understand
am
totally
my
campaign
other
than
small
donations
because
people
send
in
small
donations
for
no
no
merchandise
sales
lot
of
merchandise
sales
small
amount
of
money
compared
to
what
put
in
very
hard
when
somebody
sends
you
check
for
and
and
very
hard
to
send
that
back
am
and
always
make
the
reference
always
make
reference
to
that
and
do
it
every
time
well
referring
to
brown
somebody
that
respect
always
liked
and
very
very
respected
throughout
the
country
but
very
respected
here
and
everybody
wanted
his
endorsement
and
very
that
giving
it
to
me
and
going
to
give
it
to
me
on
the
stage
that
happens
with
endorsements
no
that
happens
with
endorsement
pretty
common
with
endorsements
poll
came
out
few
days
before
that
said
was
about
points
so
maybe
there
was
tinge
and
again
it
may
have
been
the
debate
which
would
have
set
records
if
did
it
so
would
have
liked
that
but
the
fact
is
it
could
have
been
the
debate
maybe
it
is
maybe
it
but
would
have
done
it
exactly
the
same
way
because
raised
we
raised
in
one
hour
raised
million
for
the
vets
and
would
never
ever
give
that
up
to
go
between
first
and
second
in
be
worth
it
think
her
email
situation
is
very
serious
have
feeling
being
protected
by
the
democrats
because
it
just
looks
to
me
to
be
more
serious
than
anybody
that
seen
including
if
you
watch
and
study
and
read
about
various
lawyers
you
know
what
they
do
they
really
feel
in
grave
danger
and
what
done
is
against
the
law
not
just
against
rules
against
the
law
just
know
going
to
happen
because
know
whether
or
not
the
democrats
are
going
to
protect
her
never
saw
race
where
flipping
coins
mean
flipping
coins
what
kind
of
race
is
that
ridiculous
thought
it
was
terrible
mean
you
call
it
tie
but
to
flip
coins
they
say
okay
going
to
get
this
district
going
to
flip
coin
know
tell
you
yet
think
referring
to
ted
certainly
was
dirty
what
he
did
to
ben
was
terrible
he
did
the
voter
violation
form
thought
that
was
terrible
actually
thought
it
was
terrible
and
when
they
said
that
ben
was
out
of
the
race
and
come
vote
for
him
thought
that
was
terrible
okay
thank
you
everybody
thank
you
thank
you
wow
what
crowd
thank
you
very
much

an

had
an
amazing
time
today
been
all
over
and
going
to
be
here

be
here
so
much
going
to
get
so
sick
of
me
going
to
say
please
tell
him
to
get
out
of
here
tell
him
to
leave
tell
him
to
go
but
had
an
incredible
time
and
you
know
it
started
really
had
really
pretty
good
week
the
debate
last
week
everybody
watched
the
debate
and
who
knew
about
these
debates
know
anything
about
the
debates
and
been
fun
and
been
interesting
and
been
treated
by
the
moderators
not
some
have
been
very
fair
actually
and
some
have
been
not
so
fair
and
you
know
lot
of
the
press
been
very
fair
boy
look
at
the
press
back
there
they
must
think
big
event
going
happen
today
wow
lot
of
them
like
the
academy
awards
but
had
an
amazing
been
an
amazing
experience
and
it
started
really
on
june
when
we
came
down
the
escalator
we
came
down
that
escalator
and
it
was
said
go
to
my
wife
been
so
supportive
and
so
wonderful
said
go
going
to
make
america
great
again
what
going
to
do
and
you
know
hard
to
do
this
because
when
you
think
of
it
never
done
it
before
never
been
politician
thank
goodness
but
never
been
politician
always
done
jobs
and
put
lot
of
people
to
work
tens
of
thousands
of
people
over
the
years
and
you
know
have
thousands
of
that
love
me
the
poll
just
came
out
where
leading
with
which
knew
knew
and
we
came
out
at
that
particular
opening
when
opened
and
said
going
to
run
for
president
gave
up
lot
you
know
gave
up
lot
of
different
things
including
telling
our
friends
at
no
more
apprentice
hard
to
do
you
have
top
show
and
you
say
not
doing
it
anymore
sorry
they
wanted
to
do
it
so
badly
and
fantastic
executive
came
up
to
my
office
and
said
come
on
come
on
do
it
not
going
to
run
do
it
do
it
said
going
to
run
was
pretty
sure
you
know
that
was
about
two
months
before
was
pretty
sure
it
really
is
tough
thing
to
do
you
know
all
my
life
heard
if
very
successful
person
never
run
for
president
never
really
run
for
politics
but
never
ever
run
for
president
and
built
great
company
and
tremendous
number
you
saw
the
filings
the
press
was
going
to
look
so
closely
it
was
like
when
we
put
those
papers
in
you
know
first
thing
did
announced
they
said
oh
actually
going
to
do
it
because
most
of
them
said
never
do
it
then
when
signed
when
you
sign
your
life
away
and
signed
that
they
said
whoa
he
signed
that
well
never
file
his
because
maybe
not
as
rich
as
everybody
thinks
and
filed
the
and
they
saw
an
unbelievable
you
hear
thing
about
it
oh
boy
were
they
looking
mean
were
they
looking
and
almost
pages
the
biggest
report
ever
filed
with
the
in
terms
of
that
and
it
showed
company
phenomenal
company
with
some
of
the
great
assets
very
little
debt
tremendous
cash
flow
you
know
the
way
supposed
to
be
and
great
and
the
reason
tell
you
that
is
because
that
is
the
kind
of
thinking
we
need
now
in
the
united
states
we
need
that
kind
of
thinking
we
need
that
whatever
it
is
we
need
mentality
going
to
you
know
at
trillion
in
debt
going
to
be
up
to
trillion
you
saw
that
horrible
budget
horrible
horrible
budget
that
was
approved
two
weeks
ago
and
going
to
lift
it
and
so
we
went
along
and
lot
of
things
have
happened
and
then
the
polls
came
out
which
love
and
new
ones
came
out
today
and
tell
you
right
now
you
know
now
that
at
it
and
they
came
out
some
brand
new
ones
some
beauties
and
coming
out
guess
big
coming
out
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
got
to
be
pretty
good
because
see
the
response
mean
even
this
with
all
the
people
still
trying
to
come
into
this
building
somebody
said
barn
this
is
very
nice
barn
actually
but
with
all
of
the
people
still
trying
to
come
in
you
see
what
it
is
and
we
do
have
something
special
in
couple
of
minutes
to
me
really
special
because
person
that
think
is
spectacular
person
so
very
special
to
me
but
then
the
polls
came
out
and
some
of
them
as
an
example
national
polls
for
trump
for
second
even
names
right
even
mention
names
going
to
be
today
for
change
for
the
second
and
then
all
down
some
of
them
are
actually
at
and
know
well
you
know
got
one
problem
he
loves
common
core
meaning
he
wants
your
kids
educated
from
washington
which
is
immediately
no
good
and
his
second
problem
is
very
weak
on
illegal
immigration
remember
he
said
they
come
as
an
act
of
love
said
what
they
come
as
an
act
of
love
so
think
those
are
two
very
bad
points
frankly
so
south
just
came
out
and
for
trump
for
second
for
third
great
florida
leading
by
lot
and
then
all
down
in
the
dumps
georgia
just
came
out
have
yeah
forget
hard
to
believe
with
people
people
know
when
they
took
it
but
it
was
recent
now
loves
me
and
sort
of
like
you
know
and
love
by
the
way
to
to
to
you
know
to
nothing
just
came
out
great
place
to
to
to
and
then
you
know
they
sort
of
phase
out
you
ever
hear
of
place
called
oh
love
this
doing
actually
great
first
of
all
have
to
tell
you
you
know
they
never
report
it
even
report
it
does
poll
probably
spent
millions
they
never
report
their
poll
the
poll
was
for
trump
for
nobody
talks
about
it
nobody
talks
about
it
they
talk
about
it
they
talk
about
is
reporting
other
polls
so
call
up
say
wait
minute
you
spent
fortune
on
polls
and
you
report
your
own
polls
because
winning
by
lot
and
they
have
no
excuse
but
they
keep
reporting
other
polls
but
doing
well
think
doing
lot
better
than
anyone
knows
just
came
out
for
trump
for
for
trump
for
in
other
words
little
close
here
poll
very
respected
for
trump
for
and
then
again
to
so
think
doing
good
think
actually
doing
better
than
the
polls
now
could
do
this
could
say
well
just
want
to
do
well
in
want
to
win
folks
because
look
love
the
people
the
evangelicals
have
been
phenomenal
doing
great
with
the
evangelicals
but
nationwide
winning
with
evangelical
know
if
you
know
that
by
lot
nationwide
with
doing
really
well
with
the
evangelicals
doing
really
well
with
the
tea
party
doing
well
mean
you
hear
the
numbers
mean
these
are
the
numbers
but
actually
think
doing
even
better
than
the
polls
and
you
know
the
thing
that
lot
of
people
said
you
know
they
call
up
are
you
going
to
vote
for
trump
got
very
very
tough
immigration
policies
he
wants
to
destroy
and
replace
it
with
something
lot
better
going
to
do
that
okay
but
you
know
lot
of
people
pick
up
the
phone
and
hear
different
things
and
say
no
vote
for
and
then
get
in
the
booth
and
they
say
trump
is
my
man
there
are
lot
of
people
saying
that
going
to
do
lot
better
but
see
because
you
have
to
get
to
caucus
you
have
to
go
out
got
to
do
it
otherwise
all
wasted
our
time
you
know
one
of
the
groups
in
maine
and
it
was
like
incredible
we
were
in
different
places
up
in
new
england
recently
and
new
was
amazing
and
the
people
are
standing
there
it
was
so
cold
there
was
one
little
group
of
despite
global
warming
you
know
you
hear
about
it
was
so
cold
it
was
below
zero
and
people
were
standing
outside
for
hours
trying
to
get
in
and
then
you
hear
the
announcers
well
will
they
show
up
to
vote
and
know
much
but
say
like
if
people
are
going
to
stand
out
for
four
hours
in
the
cold
or
the
heat
because
believe
me
they
stood
out
in
the
heat
during
the
summer
and
during
the
fall
like
you
believe
in
in
texas
where
we
had
people
no
matter
where
we
go
we
have
these
big
crowds
but
stand
for
hours
and
hours
to
get
in
why
they
going
to
go
and
vote
or
in
your
case
caucus
why
they
going
to
go
and
vote
sort
of
an
amazing
thing
so
we
think
going
to
really
be
why
would
somebody
wait
for
hours
for
four
hours
and
not
going
to
take
two
minutes
to
vote
now
yours
is
little
more
complicated
because
the
caucus
system
is
little
bit
different
very
interesting
system
but
it
is
different
what
have
to
say
about
very
important
so
you
know
movement
to
move
to
the
back
of
the
pack
okay
you
know
that
still
see
me
but
you
see
other
people
believe
me
loyal
to
fault
loyal
but
going
to
see
give
you
my
word
win
not
touching
this
is
an
amazing
tradition
no
seriously
this
is
an
amazing
tradition
not
moving
back
and
not
moving
new
either
because
talking
about
new
not
touching
new
so
going
to
just
keep
it
the
way
it
is
it
really
is
an
amazing
first
of
all
amazing
people
but
all
over
the
country
movement
all
over
the
country
the
people
are
incredible
they
want
to
make
america
great
again
going
to
do
something
special
and
you
know
we
used
to
talk
silent
majority
say
the
noisy
majority
because
actually
noisy
majority
not
silent
majority
but
people
are
fed
up
so
started
on
june
and
we
did
well
practically
from
the
beginning
we
went
up
and
if
you
remember
we
started
at
nothing
you
know
we
started
at
nothing
because
nobody
believed
was
going
to
run
even
when
they
my
wife
said
you
know
if
you
run
going
to
win
said
what
do
you
mean
she
said
people
believe
going
to
run
at
the
polls
was
getting
these
little
polls
felt
like
some
of
these
guys
now
that
are
senators
and
governors
they
get
these
little
polls
again
right
boy
taking
lot
of
abuse
you
know
told
him
you
know
what
you
should
use
the
name
bush
wrong
use
the
name
bush
mean
maybe
not
working
but
better
than
right
you
know
really
do
get
rid
of
the
exclamation
point
and
just
put
bush
your
name
be
ashamed
of
your
name
so
anyways
wish
him
the
best
but
you
know
started
and
started
at
like
or
and
then
it
went
to
and
then
it
went
to
and
each
time
the
pundits
these
real
geniuses
back
here
some
of
them
are
sitting
back
here
these
real
geniuses
like
george
will
with
the
little
glasses
take
away
the
glasses
he
looks
like
dumb
guy
telling
you
but
each
time
these
geniuses
would
say
well
reached
his
plateau
at
right
then
it
goes
to
well
you
know
this
is
surprising
but
reached
his
plateau
and
then
it
goes
to
and
then
it
went
to
then
it
went
to
then
it
went
actually
in
the
poll
and
in
we
got
to
and
even
little
above
that
and
then
all
of
sudden
you
hear
so
much
about
the
plateau
want
to
plateau
at
you
know
with
like
people
pretty
good
but
they
kept
saying
all
get
got
these
followers
we
have
the
smartest
followers
there
are
number
one
we
have
the
smartest
and
the
hardest
working
followers
we
have
people
that
love
the
country
more
than
anybody
and
they
want
to
take
back
happened
because
our
country
is
going
to
hell
we
can
be
nice
about
it
we
can
say
it
nice
and
soft
our
country
is
going
to
hell
when
you
look
at
this
crazy
iran
deal
where
paying
billion
and
they
give
us
the
five
back
but
they
know
where
the
fifth
is
and
you
understand
what
that
means
not
good
sign
but
they
give
us
five
people
but
they
get
seven
and
they
get
off
the
these
are
bad
dudes
they
get
plus
seven
so
getting
people
and
they
have
the
right
to
do
whatever
they
want
from
an
enterprise
standpoint
right
to
do
oil
right
to
do
whatever
they
want
but
what
do
they
also
get
out
of
that
deal
first
of
all
going
to
get
nuclear
they
have
to
develop
nuclear
missiles
they
can
buy
them
for
the
kind
of
money
we
gave
them
going
to
buy
them
why
are
they
going
to
develop
remember
the
deal
days
they
have
days
for
inspection
period
they
also
have
right
but
we
paid
billion
and
always
say
wow
what
great
the
are
great
negotiators
say
what
great
deal
that
is
two
weeks
ago
started
said
wait
minute
not
good
deal
compared
to
the
other
deal
they
took
over
iraq
we
gave
them
iraq
we
knocked
the
hell
out
of
iraq
we
decimated
their
armed
forces
and
you
know
for
years
they
would
fight
for
many
many
years
for
decades
fight
fight
fight
nobody
would
win
fight
rest
then
go
back
to
fight
and
now
we
gave
them
the
second
largest
oil
reserves
in
the
world
which
is
iraq
we
gave
it
to
them
now
going
into
yemen
and
if
you
look
at
yemen
take
look
going
to
get
syria
going
to
get
yemen
unless
you
know
trust
me
lot
of
good
things
are
going
to
happen
if
get
in
but
just
sort
of
leave
it
the
way
it
is
they
get
syria
they
get
yemen
now
they
want
yemen
but
did
you
ever
see
the
border
between
yemen
and
saudi
arabia
they
want
saudi
arabia
so
what
are
they
going
to
have
going
to
have
iraq
going
to
have
iran
going
to
have
iraq
going
to
have
yemen
going
to
have
syria
going
to
have
everything
going
to
be
monster
created
this
we
have
stupid
leadership
really
stupid
leadership
so
when
started
said
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
not
something
wanted
to
do
something
we
have
to
do
because
representing
you
not
taking
any
money
not
you
know
like
some
of
these
guys
where
getting
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
from
people
know
and
nice
people
and
some
are
very
bad
people
but
they
have
no
interest
in
the
country
they
have
interests
in
their
company
or
they
have
interests
in
countries
representing
and
these
people
and
these
politicians
are
going
to
do
exactly
as
told
by
their
lobbyists
their
special
interests
and
their
donors
me
going
to
do
the
right
thing
and
always
tell
the
story
when
ford
moves
to
mexico
going
to
talk
them
out
of
it
when
moves
its
plant
from
chicago
to
mexico
going
to
talk
them
out
of
it
believe
me
going
to
be
easy
going
to
be
easy
so
started
and
talked
about
the
border
very
strong
on
immigration
and
illegal
immigration
took
lot
of
heat
but
you
even
be
talking
about
that
subject
if
bring
it
up
and
talked
about
again
talked
about
isis
and
talked
about
but
what
really
happened
is
after
paris
we
had
people
killed
and
by
the
way
told
you
common
core
is
dead
and
second
amendment
is
right
this
way
going
to
protect
the
second
amendment
going
to
protect
the
guns
going
to
protect
your
guns
you
know
if
in
paris
and
if
in
we
had
the
two
maniacs
that
were
married
she
came
on
fiancee
permit
you
know
wonderful
fiancee
she
was
totally
maybe
him
maybe
he
was
already
that
way
but
got
to
start
thinking
we
have
to
start
using
our
head
bad
stuff
is
happening
we
have
to
find
out
going
on
we
have
president
who
even
talk
about
the
term
if
you
think
he
even
mention
anything
to
do
with
what
we
all
know
is
going
on
and
you
solve
the
problem
if
you
talk
about
it
you
have
to
talk
about
it
so
very
very
strongly
we
started
talking
about
that
and
then
after
paris
and
by
the
way
if
we
had
couple
of
you
and
you
and
you
and
you
if
we
had
three
or
four
people
in
that
room
in
paris
as
an
example
where
they
have
the
toughest
gun
laws
like
in
the
world
you
have
gun
unless
bad
guy
you
bought
gun
and
they
walked
in
just
said
boom
boom
boom
you
move
over
boom
killed
more
to
follow
because
there
are
people
that
are
so
badly
wounded
but
if
we
had
couple
of
few
of
the
people
that
pointed
out
could
plenty
in
this
audience
believe
me
but
if
they
had
guns
on
their
waist
if
they
had
guns
around
their
ankle
where
the
bullets
went
the
opposite
direction
it
would
have
been
whole
different
story
folks
be
whole
different
story
so
very
very
big
on
the
second
amendment
but
what
happened
is
all
of
sudden
after
paris
and
to
an
extent
to
pretty
big
extent
in
california
what
happened
is
these
polls
started
coming
in
where
everybody
liked
trump
even
more
went
up
points
want
to
do
it
for
that
reason
but
it
went
up
because
people
want
strength
just
like
having
the
family
of
john
who
was
great
love
john
from
but
out
of
nowhere
got
the
most
beautiful
letter
from
his
daughter
who
you
just
met
an
incredible
woman
and
she
said
like
to
endorse
you
john
was
strong
guy
we
need
strength
we
need
strength
in
this
country
because
withering
away
with
political
correctness
nonsense
okay
nonsense
mean
if
you
think
of
it
you
say
merry
anymore
going
to
say
merry
again
you
go
into
these
department
stores
they
have
any
displays
they
have
the
sign
merry
even
people
that
christian
are
saying
merry
we
love
let
us
say
happy
holidays
but
people
like
to
see
it
and
stores
put
it
up
anymore
withering
away
going
in
the
wrong
direction
so
said
going
to
do
this
and
had
no
idea
it
was
going
to
work
this
way
figured
be
in
the
pack
and
maybe
like
race
horse
you
know
just
at
the
end
you
can
sort
of
inch
it
out
had
no
idea
to
have
point
leads
nationally
up
by
so
much
and
you
know
want
to
keep
it
that
way
want
to
keep
it
that
way
when
you
think
and
just
one
thing
before
introduce
our
incredible
person
our
incredible
guest
but
one
thing
spent
to
this
point
almost
nothing
and
in
first
place
by
lot
tell
this
story
not
bragging
about
spending
just
saying
telling
the
story
have
spent
tell
you
almost
nothing
and
in
first
place
by
some
polls
have
me
points
lot
okay
you
know
some
people
have
have
lead
of
but
in
first
place
by
lot
has
spent
now
million
think
of
it
and
you
know
the
reason
bring
him
up
even
bring
him
up
but
he
spends
fortune
on
against
me
you
people
have
all
seen
it
before
got
along
with
everybody
contributed
to
everybody
was
world
class
businessman
now
politician
which
hate
to
tell
you
but
you
go
with
everybody
you
want
to
love
everybody
you
want
them
all
to
love
you
unless
stupid
but
you
want
everybody
to
love
you
everybody
knows
this
story
but
so
much
money
has
been
spent
on
me
but
he
spent
million
spend
nothing
in
first
by
lot
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pack
and
said
to
myself
amazing
that
be
great
if
this
were
the
country
doing
this
as
an
example
education
number
in
the
world
we
have
third
world
countries
that
are
ahead
of
us
education
is
very
important
to
me
world
mean
countries
that
you
believe
are
ahead
of
us
you
believe
if
you
heard
the
names
of
some
of
these
countries
so
but
number
one
in
spending
per
pupil
by
far
it
be
nice
if
you
had
like
this
election
process
where
we
spent
the
least
but
we
had
the
best
education
you
know
so
sweden
and
norway
and
china
and
others
are
the
best
nowhere
near
them
and
yet
we
spend
far
more
per
pupil
so
going
to
change
that
and
told
you
going
to
get
it
but
going
to
change
that
watch
you
just
watch
will
tell
you
this
you
educate
your
children
through
bureaucrats
in
washington
and
what
happens
with
common
core
when
the
parents
take
over
and
really
mean
this
because
seen
it
when
the
parents
surround
those
schools
and
they
love
those
kids
and
they
love
those
pupils
and
even
when
their
kids
graduate
they
are
committed
to
those
schools
committed
to
education
you
can
do
so
much
better
in
than
they
can
possibly
do
telling
you
what
to
do
in
washington
and
not
all
of
them
but
most
of
them
are
just
interested
in
my
check
how
much
do
get
make
the
process
complicated
and
some
of
the
things
that
your
kids
are
made
to
study
are
an
outrage
okay
so
going
to
bring
that
back
locally
and
going
to
be
great
so
what
happened
essentially
is
started
looking
and
all
of
sudden
things
changed
and
people
are
now
looking
they
know
do
great
with
china
going
to
do
great
with
japan
going
to
do
great
with
mexico
killing
us
in
trade
and
killing
us
also
at
the
border
we
will
build
wall
and
you
know
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
mexico
going
to
pay
for
it
because
they
make
fortune
and
all
of
those
things
but
now
really
focused
on
security
and
because
will
tell
you
that
all
of
polls
and
the
polls
where
said
in
particular
that
trump
is
just
not
by
little
bit
but
by
many
many
percentage
points
winning
on
isis
winning
on
the
military
winning
with
the
vets
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
big
league
by
the
way
big
league
big
league
and
going
to
really
take
care
of
our
military
going
to
be
big
and
strong
and
powerful
and
going
to
mess
with
us
and
the
cheapest
thing
we
can
do
tell
you
that
right
now
so
been
real
focus
just
want
to
now
say
just
couple
of
words
about
very
special
person
this
is
person
who
known
for
long
time
who
respected
for
so
long
an
incredible
husband
an
incredible
family
and
somebody
that
when
heard
that
she
was
going
to
endorse
me
was
so
you
have
no
idea
how
and
would
like
to
bring
up
if
might
special
special
person
thank
you
audience
members
shouting
let
me
just
tell
you
let
me
just
tell
you
little
secret

cheapest
thing
we
can
do

going
to
have
to
use

to
have
to
use
it

they
talk
about

one
the
other
big
poll
that
came
out
just
two
days
ago
was
the
national
poll
trump
and
then
even
mention
the
other
numbers
because
so
low
you
know
when
you
have
so
many
people
running
we
had
and
then
they
started
to
drop
ding
bing
love
it
love
it
and
be
losing
lot
over
the
next
little
while
would
imagine
know
when
down
at
zero
would
think
that
eventually
drop
out
the
only
difference
is
nothing
to
pick
up
if
there
is
zero
what
do
you
pick
up
so
anyways
be
seeing
that
one
of
the
things
think
so
important
because
to
me
very
important
in
the
same
poll
which
is
the
big
national
poll
on
the
economy
so
important
trump
everyone
else
nothing
on
the
budget
really
good
at
these
things
economy
budgets
sort
of
expected
this
on
the
budget
trump
this
is
with
people
remaining
trump
everyone
else
bing
oh
one
that
started
and
took
lot
of
heat
took
lot
of
heat
sort
of
like
the
one
talking
about
today
guess
heard
little
bit
about
it
but
taken
lot
of
heat
on
this
one
illegal
immigration
now
had
not
brought
that
up
in
trump
tower
in
june
when
announced
that
was
going
to
run
for
president
which
takes
courage
to
run
for
president
believe
me
you
know
all
of
my
life
heard
that
if
successful
person
especially
if
you
have
very
success
done
lot
of
things
lot
of
deals
lot
of
everything
you
run
for
president
and
yet
the
kind
of
mindset
and
thinking
this
country
needs
being
run
by
people
that
know
what
doing
very
sad
on
illegal
immigration
trump
with
people
everyone
else
no
good
on
thing
called
worry
have
plenty
talk
lot
about
isis
can
you
believe
it
here
we
have
generals
they
go
on
television
and
talk
they
do
all
talk
you
people
lot
of
military
people
here
military
here
all
right
love
you
by
the
way
speaking
of
it
going
to
make
our
military
so
strong
so
powerful
so
great
ever
going
to
mess
with
us
again
nobody
never
going
to
mess
with
us
you
know
in
many
ways
the
cheapest
thing
we
can
do
the
cheapest
thing
instead
of
fighting
these
wars
that
we
know
what
doing
and
we
have
leaders
that
are
afraid
to
do
anything
going
to
make
it
so
great
so
strong
that
people
gosh
not
messing
not
messing
and
going
to
take
care
of
our
great
vets
our
wounded
warriors
going
to
take
care
of
them
because
they
thank
you
they
are
not
being
taken
care
of
we
have
illegal
immigrants
that
are
taken
care
of
better
than
our
incredible
veterans
and
not
going
to
happen
any
longer
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
so
with
isis
trump
can
you
imagine
that
with
all
of
these
characters
running
on
foreign
policy
trump
way
up
and
you
know
in
theory
you
could
say
well
maybe
not
my
thing
but
people
want
to
see
strong
they
want
to
see
strength
they
want
to
see
protection
they
want
to
be
protected
and
it
watched
last
night
and
watched
the
president
truly
that
know
what
he
was
doing
he
know
why
he
was
there
he
refuses
to
use
the
term
radical
islamic
terrorism
he
refuses
to
use
the
term
even
know
if
he
knows
what
the
hell
is
going
on
really
and
then
looking
at
honestly
know
just
going
to
be
an
extension
of
think
maybe
worse
got
no
strength
got
no
stamina
remember
that
you
need
president
with
no
strength
or
stamina
when
being
ripped
off
on
trade
being
ripped
off
on
which
is
going
to
be
repealed
and
replaced
by
something
really
good
when
our
soldiers
being
taken
care
of
when
our
military
is
never
been
like
it
is
today
one
of
the
generals
was
on
television
as
usual
saying
that
the
least
prepared
now
than
that
ever
seen
it
and
been
there
long
time
retiring
how
we
are
in
the
most
dangerous
world
ever
had
because
of
the
power
of
weapons
we
have
people
that
know
they
telling
you
watch
them
watch
these
generals
being
interviewed
do
you
think
george
would
be
interviewed
be
interviewed
after
total
and
complete
victory
not
big
for
interviews
you
know
they
shoot
first
they
talk
later
these
guys
and
think
have
to
you
know
just
so
you
understand
bush
bush
he
said
yesterday
he
was
being
interviewed
he
said
that
he
was
talking
about
me
he
was
saying
the
nicest
things
about
me
of
course
he
says
be
elected
at
what
right
no
but
he
said
some
things
and
was
like
said
who
says
that
about
an
opponent
you
say
those
things
find
out
what
he
said
but
he
said
very
nice
things
but
if
you
look
at
what
happens
where
he
is
upset
with
me
because
he
says
the
tone
the
tone
of
trump
is
not
nice
and
say
it
all
the
time
we
have
people
whose
heads
are
being
chopped
off
in
the
middle
east
because
christian
and
for
other
reasons
being
dumped
and
drowned
in
steel
cages
and
we
talk
about
my
tone
said
the
same
thing
tone
is
not
nice
these
people
are
living
in
different
planet
different
planet
and
remember
what
said
about
we
need
somebody
strong
we
need
somebody
with
incredible
energy
but
incredible
intelligence
and
all
of
those
things
you
know
know
lot
of
tough
people
but
not
smart
no
good
easy
we
need
tough
we
need
smart
we
need
like
every
character
we
are
so
far
behind
the
eight
ball
in
this
country
we
owe
trillion
the
budget

going
to
make
it

of
it

the
hell

heard
of
the
word
years
ago

in
the
very
near
future
really
in
trouble
we
have
to
rebuild
our
country
we
have
to
rebuild
our
infrastructure
we
have
to
rebuild
our
military
and
yet
we
do
deals
with
china
where
trade
imbalance
of
over
billion
year
in
their
by
the
way
in
case
you
had
any
question

they
send
their
cars
by
the
millions
billion
year
imbalance
like
loss
you
look
at
mexico
going
to
build
wall

will
be
real
wall

will
be
real
wall
happen

the
people
dealing
with
and
you
know
really
focus
on
later
because
have
to
get
through
these
people
you
know
of
us
had
perry
came
at
me
strong
he
went
down
had
walker
nice
guy
he
went
down
every
guy
that

him
and
he
keeps
talking
he
gets
so
much
television
mean
on
television
all
the
time
and
he
go
up
at
zero
folks
his
ideas
are
so
bad
more
militaristic
than
him
but
know
how
to
win
he
he
just
wants
to
attack
everything
he
know
where
the
hell
ha
and
he
always
sits
with
john
like
the
twins
always
sitting
together
no
true
do
you
ever
notice
sometimes
want
to
see
him
by
himself
always
sitting
with
john
fine
not
knocking
it
but
you
got
to
know
what
to
do
now
me
was
against
the
war
in
iraq
so
everyone
says
you
have
the
right
temperament
have
great
temperament
but
got
to
attack
if
got
to
do
something
got
to
know
what
doing
said
if
you
attack
iraq
and
you
wipe
it
out
iran
is
going
to
take
over
the
entire
middle
east
because
going
to
ruin
the
balance
it
was
so
simple
to
me
and
actually
they
sent
group
from
the
white
house
to
see
me
because
got
so
much
publicity
so
much
publicity
that
they
sent
group
from
the
white
house
to
see
trump
said
going
to
have
iran
take
over
the
middle
east
and
happening
and
going
to
take
over
iraq
as
sure
as
sitting
there
and
by
the
way
iraq
with
the
second
largest
oil
reserves
anywhere
in
the
world
we
lost
of
thousands
of
lives
we
have
wounded
warriors
all
over
the
place
trillion
we
have
nothing
we
got
nothing
we
have
absolutely
nothing
and
we
left
and
we
have
president
we
have
been
there
but
then
we
have
left
the
way
we
left
you
know
the
funny
thing
is
look
at
democrats
and
liberals
and
conservatives
and
republicans
it
be
good
all
of
us
if
we
can
get
together
and
really
make
our
country
great
again
is
that
what
we
want
to
do
bet
you
that
if
spoke
to
that
young
woman
that
quickly
really
think
can
convince
her
that
all
in
this
together
folks
we
want
to
have
strong
country
right
you
know
if
you
think
about
it
and
have
some
that
can
never
be
satisfied
no
matter
what
just
troublemakers
but
most
people
and
they
believe
something
and
have
some
very
smart
friends
agree
with
me
they
agree
with
the
other
side
but
really
believe
that
if
you
took
it
about
making
america
great
we
have
to
be
strong
we
have
to
be
vigilant
and
if
not
vigilant
interrupted
by
protester
that
was
the
same
person
got
to
tell
you
so
far
the
security
is
not
doing
great
job
in
here
tell
you
that
that
was
the
same
person
you
can
do
very
nice
but
why
you
get
her
out
because
honestly
inappropriate
so
security
strengthen
yourself
up
see
our
country
has
this
kind
of
security
the
problem
we
her
very
nicely
please
but
she
should
now
be
taken
out
same
person
one
person
one
person
they
let
her
out
they
gave
her
second
chance
and
the
same
thing
happens
but
you
would
think
that
everybody
all
on
the
same
basket
that
everybody
every
single
person
interrupted
by
protester
you
would
think
that
if
we
could
get
together
all
be
in
the
same
boat
now
last
night
we
all
saw
and
we
witnessed
something
that
thought
was
highly
inappropriate
in
fact
is
that
all
there
is
about
the
and
wrote
something
today
that
think
is
very
very
salient
very
important
and
probably
not
politically
correct
but
care
care
you
know
we
had
situation
in
california
very
recently
where
somebody
was
making
bombs
in
an
apartment
the
mother
saw
them
the
mother
notice
anything
wrong
watched
the
sister
being
interviewed
believe
me
in
my
opinion
she
was
lying
like
crazy
watched
that
interview
oh
my
brother
was
such
wonderful
guy
know
know
know
and
watched
the
next
door
saying
oh
well
we
report
them
because
we
want
to
racially
profile
or
we
want
to
profile
give
me
break
give
me
break
like
the
stupid
country
in
so
many
different
ways
so
can
you
imagine
what
our
great
leaders
of
the
past
would
have
said
with
the
kind
of
crap
happening
with
us
they
want
to
report
them
because
they
thought
it
was
profiling
okay
they
saw
bombs
they
saw
you
know
the
pipe
bombs
only
this
to
build
bathroom
when
bomb
is
this
long
put
too
many
of
them
together
for
bathroom
right
and
we
thought
they
maybe
but
we
want
to
racially
profile
oh
okay
okay
innocent
or
how
about
where
the
families
and
the
girlfriends
and
the
wives
and
everything
and
they
go
back
to
world
trade
the
worst
worse
than
pearl
because
with
the
world
trade
they
were
killing
innocent
civilians
at
least
while
it
was
dirty
rotten
sneak
attack
at
least
they
while
it
was
an
attack
at
least
it
was
military
but
this
was
an
attack
on
the
world
trade
so
happened
is
out
of
control
we
have
no
idea
coming
into
our
country
we
have
no
idea
if
they
love
us
or
if
they
hate
us
we
have
no
idea
if
they
want
to
bomb
us
we
have
no
idea
going
on
and
then
looked
at
poll
numbers
and
mean
polls
where
winning
those
numbers
like
looking
at
these
numbers
hated
to
look
at
and
very
very
sad
go
after
some
of
the
numbers
of
those
polled
and
this
was
from
the
for
security
policy
very
highly
respected
group
of
people
who
know
actually
this
is
people
living
in
this
country
of
those
polled
agreed
that
violence
against
americans
is
justified
as
muslims
of
the
muslims
living
in
this
country
by
the
way
have
friends
that
are
muslims
great
people
but
they
know
we
have
problem
they
know
we
have
real
problem
because
going
on
and
we
put
up
with
it
folks
we
put
up
with
it
highly
respected
number
of
polling
groups
want
to
be
governed
according
to
you
know
what
is
so
wrote
this
out
the
mainstream
media
wants
to
surrender
the
constitution
the
mainstream
media
these
people
back
here
the
worst
they
are
so
dishonest
no
no
so
dishonest
they
are
so
dishonest
mean
have
one
from
reporter
from
and
actually
another
one
from
they
actually
in
columbus
ohio
had
tremendous
crowd
like
people
it
was
love
fest
it
went
on
for
long
time
everybody
stayed
right
the
end
had
one
of
the
politicians
who
is
just
getting
horrible
made
statement
that
oh
they
left
after
minutes
now
the
press
was
there
they
saw
it
nobody
said
it
was
lie
it
was
total
lie
in
fact
had
more
people
at
the
end
than
had
at
the
beginning
leaving
leaving
here
except
for
the
one
person
that
was
screaming
so
we
asked
the
press
to
report
that
it
was
total
lie
and
they
want
to
do
that
because
not
their
thing
to
do
you
know
we
get
the
biggest
crowds
they
want
to
show
this
crowd
tonight
not
going
to
show
all
the
people
outside
trying
to
get
in
they
do
that
they
have
the
cameras

in
my
face
say
fan
the
crowd

to
show
look

all
the
people

in
the
history
of
this
ship
but

and
say
fan
it
and
they
never
ever
fan
it
say
fan
the
crowd

they
never
fan
it
and
yet
guarantee
you
that
that
young
woman
that
just
got
taken
out
after
interrupting
us
three
times
guarantee
the
cameras
will
be
on
her
guarantee
disgusting
disgusting
by
the
way
some
of
the
terrific
but
most
of
it
is
absolute
dishonest
absolute
scum
remember
that
scum
scum
totally
dishonest
people
had
one

but
he
sort
of
went

said
this
time
going

the
recent
fox
poll
that
just
came
out
has
me
beating
very
easily
one
on
one
love
that
so
important
so
we
put
out
statement
today
we
watched
this
and
impossible
to
watch
this
gross
incompetence
but
watched
last
night
and
we
put
out
statement
little
while
ago
and
these
people
are
going
shall
read
you
the
statement
trump
is
calling
for
now
got
to
listen
to
this
because
this
is
pretty
heavy
stuff
and
common
sense
and
we
have
to
do
it
remember
the
poll
numbers
remember
the
poll
numbers
so
remember
this
so
listen
trump
is
calling
for
total
and
complete
shutdown
of
muslims
entering
the
united
states
until
our
representatives
can
figure
out
what
the
hell
is
going
on
we
have
no
choice
we
have
no
choice
we
have
no
choice
according
to
pew
research
among
others
there
is
great
hatred
toward
americans
by
large
segments
of
the
muslim
population
most
recently
poll
from
for
security
policy
released
data
showing
of
those
polled
agreed
that
violence
against
americans
these
are
people
that
are
here
by
the
way
people
that
are
here
not
by
the
way
would
be
unacceptable
is
unacceptable
of
those
polled
agreed
that
violence
against
americans
here
in
the
united
states
is
justified
as
part
think
of
that
as
part
of
the
global
jihad
they
want
to
change
your
religion
think
so
think
so
think
so
not
going
to
happen
as
part
of
the
global
jihad
and
of
those
polled
agreed
that
muslims
in
america
should
have
the
choice
of
being
governed
according
to
you
know
what
is
now
look
this
is
mean
terrible
such
atrocities
as
murders
against
who
convert
and
more
unthinkable
acts
that
pose
great
harm
to
americans
especially
women
mean
you
look
especially
women
tough
stuff
and
we
have
president
that
even
mention
the
term
and
talking
about
numbers
like
this
trump
stated
without
looking
at
the
various
polling
data
obvious
to
anybody
the
hatred
is
beyond
where
the
hatred
comes
from
and
why
have
to
determine
have
to
figure
it
out
we
have
to
figure
it
out
we
live
like
this
going
to
get
worse
and
worse
going
to
have
more
world
trade
going
to
get
worse
and
worse
folks
we
could
be
politically
correct
and
we
can
be
stupid
but
going
to
get
worse
and
worse
until
we
are
able
to
determine
and
understand
this
problem
and
the
dangerous
threat
it
poses
our
country
can
not
be
the
victim
of
horrendous
attacks
by
people
that
believe
only
in
jihad
these
are
people
only
believe
in
jihad
they
want
our
system
they
want
our
system
and
have
no
sense
of
reason
or
respect
for
human
life
they
have
no
respect
for
human
life
prior
to
paris
which
was
disaster
which
by
the
way
if
some
of
the
people
in
those
places
where
it
was
slaughter
absolute
slaughter
had
guns
you
have
had
the
carnage
that
you
had
in
paris
you
had
that
carnage
if
they
had
guns
you
had
that
carnage
so
important
the
second
amendment
we
have
to
preserve
it
and
cherish
it
and
we
let
these
weak
leaders
diminish
it
if
they
had
guns
in
paris
if
five
people
in
that
room
paris
and
france
has
probably
the
toughest
gun
laws
anywhere
in
the
world
and
it
was
like
target
practice
come
over
here
boom
come
over
here
boom
people
are
sitting
by
the
hundreds
and
many
others
are
going
to
be
dying
sitting
in
the
hospital
in
many
cases
waiting
to
die
now
the
same
thing
few
days
ago
in
california
no
guns
we
have
guns
the
bad
guys
had
the
guns
and
these
young
people
and
tell
the
press
got
to
stop
calling
them
these
are
dirty
rotten
these
remember
the
guy
in
paris
with
the
big
dirty
hat
remember
the
guy
in
paris
the
mastermind
was
watching
all
the
networks
mention
who
but
some
of
them
disgusted
me
the
mastermind
is
on
the
loose
and
we
have
kids
that
are
watching
the
internet
and
they
want
to
be
and
then
you
wonder
why
do
we
lose
all
these
kids
they
go
over
there
young
impressionable
they
go
over
there
and
they
want
to
join

we
have
our
anchors
think
got
them
mostly
stopped
did
you

they
say
the
young
mastermind
oh

the
press
has
to
be
responsible
not

responsible
because
losing
lot
of
people
because
of
the
internet
and
we
have
to
do
something

lot
of
different
people
that
really
understand
happening
we
have
to
talk

maybe
in
certain
areas
closing
that
internet

some
way
somebody

people
we
have
lot
of
foolish
people
we
have
lot
of
foolish
people
got
to
maybe
do
something
with
the
internet
because
they
are
recruiting

then
when
they
come
back

the
woman

probably
the
first
women
ever
had
know
what
was
going
on
but
he
became
quickly
notice
how
easy
it
is
he
becomes
and
then
they
go
on
spree
folks
those
days
are
over
those
days
are
over
we
have
to
be
tough
we
have
to
be
smart
we
have
to
be
vigilant
yes

we
have
to
know
about

different
things

on
the
whole
thing
that

way
until

find
out
and
he
talked
about
inexperience
and
you

words
he
has
experience
right

the
statement
of
an
inexperienced

that
sound
like
inexperienced

had
you
know
so
friendly
with
president
during
the
flood
actually
called
said
let
me
ask
you
is
he
going
to
vote
for
thought
he
was
going
to
vote
for
know
think
he
possibly
did
and
was
very
disappointed
one
of
the
reasons
was
disappointed
was
he
called
and
had
dinner
right
after
the
election
if
did
that
to
me
would
have
never
spoken
to
him
again
would
have
never
done
it
so
when
talks
about
when
he
talks
about
lack
of
experience
built
this
incredible
company
filed
papers
where
everyone
said
wow
that
is
unbelievable
would
have
probably
filed
them
even
when
run
because
built
great
great
company
tremendous
cash
tremendous
assets
tremendous
net
worth
very
little
debt
unbelievable
cash
flow
and
filed
everybody
said
number
one
he
run
and
ran
took
deep
breath
and
said
go
to
my
wife
and
we
came
down
that
escalator
right
the
famous
escalators
hopefully
in
many
years
that
will
be
very
famous
scene
because
we
will
have
turned
around
our
country
and
that
will
be
positive
note
okay
but
then
they
said
oh
well
he
announced
so
these
talking
heads
most
of
whom
are
not
even
smart
people
believe
me
then
say
well
they
went
to
ivy
league
college
so
did
go
to
ivy
league
college
they
went
to
this
most
of
them
go
to
ivy
league
colleges
by
the
way
but
they
say
brilliant
brilliant
because
he
wears
glasses
you
know
like
perry
remember
perry
we
like
him
but
what
happens
is
they
say
well
never
file
form
basically
where
you
sign
your
life
away
filed
form
then
they
said
well
never
sign
his
financial
statement
because
maybe
not
as
rich
as
everybody
thinks
then
they
said
and
if
he
does
ask
for
many
many
delays
because
entitled
to
day
delays
delays
and
you
can
delay
it
until
forever
and
delay
it
until
after
the
election
said
no
so
filed
it
ahead
of
schedule
and
what
happened
remember
they
went
down
they
believe
it
it
was
much
much
much
better
than
anybody
ever
envisioned
built
great
company
and
the
reason
honestly
worth
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
remember
that
low
debt
great
cash
flow
and
the
greatest
assets
trump
tower
the
trump
building
big
chunk
of
the
bank
of
america
building
in
san
land
all
over
land
on
the
land
all
over
in
north
have
great
piece
of
property
trump
national
golf
club
some
of
you
know
it
great
right
at
the
best
location
and
what
happens
what
happens
so
filed
and
everyone
said
oh
believe
it
then
they
said
well
maybe
he
do
so
well
with
the
polls
and
you
know
before
went
people
never
believed
was
going
to
run
they
never
thought
was
going
to
run
and
told
the
story
the
other
night
for
really
the
first
real
time
but
my
wife
said
to
me
you
know
if
you
run
you
will
win
you
very
smart
said
what
do
you
mean
she
said
if
you
run
never
going
to
poll
before
nobody
believes
going
to
run
so
if
they
do
polls
like
they
did
these
early
polls
they
great
before
announced
she
said
no
the
only
way
going
to
get
poll
number
is
got
to
announce
nobody
believes
even
though
they
say
even
though
they
say
running
it
matter
nobody
believes
running
so
said
all
right
getting
these
lousy
early
numbers
and
saying
know
want
to
run
and
find
out
it
work
want
to
be
embarrassed
like
graham
and
all
these
guys
who
have
nothing
true
true
so
said
all
right
take
it
so
we
go
down
on
the
escalator
you
know
what
did
you
remember
took
deep
breath
because
telling
you
and
you
know
what
talking
about
the
press
down
there
look
like
the
academy
awards
there
were
so
many
cameras
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
the
entire
atrium
of
trump
tower
was
packed
with
cameras
and
press
and
just
said
go
to
my
wife
took
deep
breath
and
went
down
and
talked
about
lots
of
things
including
illegal
immigration
and
illegal
immigration
was
such
big
subject
and
telling
you
had
not
brought
it
up
it
has
turned
out
to
be
and
took
heat
took
heat
like
nobody
has
ever
taken
heat
rush
said
the
most
incredible
incoming
that
ever
seen
human
being
endure
and
then
he
doubled
down
week
later
because
was
right
and
now
illegal
immigration
is
one
of
the
biggest
things
and
then
you
had
the
killing
of
and
the
killing
of
and
the
killing
recently
in
california
of
think
of
it
veteran
female
raped
and
killed
by
an
illegal
immigrant
and
many
many
more
huge
problem
and
they
take
our
jobs
and
lot
of
other
things
so
all
of
sudden
saying
wow
from
almost
at
the
beginning
seen
been
at
the
top
like
from
almost
day
one
reason
tell
you
certain
things
and
the
reason
talk
about
what
done
and
lots
of
good
things
little
thing
ice
skating
rink
the
city
get
it
built
for
high
years
they
were
in
there
for
like
million
they
get
it
done
went
to
the
mayor
of
new
york
said
get
it
done
real
quick
he
like
it
because
he
want
to
be
shown
up
said
do
it
and
if
it
costs
more
than
million
pay
for
it
got
it
built
for
peanuts
got
it
done
in
four
months
and
we
had
ice
skating
in
central
park
and
still
run
it
did
another
one
did
bigger
version
of
that
recently
ferry
point
out
in
the
they
were
having
things
have
been
under
construction
from
anywhere
between
and
years
they
get
it
done
got
it
done
under
year
operating
now
very
successful
what
do
and
what
we
need
what
we
need
in
our
country
building
on
avenue
an
incredible
hotel
one
of
the
great
hotels
of
the
world
the
old
post
office
site
think
of
it
got
it
in
the
administration
everybody
was
bidding
everybody
wanted
it
one
of
the
most
sought
after
projects
in
the
history
of
the
general
services
and
got
it
can
you
imagine
me
getting
it
from
the
administration
because
the
who
are
really
professionals
they
want
to
make
sure
number
one
that
it
got
built
so
they
wanted
strong
and
they
also
wanted
great
plan
so
we
came
up
with
and
my
kids
we
came
up
with
this
incredible
plan
the
job
is
under
budget
ahead
of
schedule
it
was
going
to
open
up
in
sometime
during
the
year
now
going
to
open
probably
in
september
of
right
before
the
election
on
avenue
and
this
is
the
kind
of
mindset
you
need
one
of
the
great
businessmen
and
others
have
endorsed
me
we
have
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
offshore
leaving
the
united
states
in
the
old
days
somebody
would
leave
for
frankly
south
leave
new
york
or
florida
or
where
the
taxes
are
lower
leave
for
north
leave
today
leave
this
country
for
other
countries
so
now
losing
losing
many
of
our
great
companies
we
have
trillion
offshore
at
least
and
everybody
agrees
it
should
come
home
the
democrats
the
republicans
for
three
years
they
make
deal
they
make
deal
because
such
gridlock
no
leadership
in
washington
we
will
make
this
country
so
great
we
have
people
and
tell
you
something
tell
you
interrupted
by
protester
said
something
to
me
the
other
day
and
what
really
want
to
do
interrupted
by
protester
what
we
want
to
do
or
what
want
to
do
is
want
to
be
the
president
of
this
think
of
this
work
for
any
of
the
lobbyists
work
for
any
of
these
people
that
are
leading
our
country
in
the
wrong
direction
we
best
thing
that
seen
in
going
around
and
the
thing
that
seen
more
than
anything
else
is
how
smart
the
people
are
they
believe
those
people
in
the
back
that
write
with
fork
telling
you
they
believe
them
the
people
are
really
smart
giving
me
more
inspiration
than
any
other
single
thing
are
the
people
that
met
the
incredible
people
of
this
country
going
to
make
america
great
again
and
you
know
what
going
to
make
it
greater
greater
than
ever
before
and
love
you
all
and
thank
you
very
much
south
great
thank
you
we
love
you
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
you
just
like
me
because
my
daughter
happens
to
be
jewish
right
she
has
great
husband
and
tell
you
what
could
not
be
happier
and
very
proud
the
only
bad
news
get
her
on
saturday
call
and
call
speak
to
my
daughter
anymore
on
but
okay
an
to
be
with
you
you
know
devoted
so
much
time
over
my
life
to
israel
and
the
other
politicians
they
can
talk
but
believe
me
they
done
what
done
received
many
many
awards
was
the
grand
marshal
of
the
israeli
day
parade
at
very
dangerous
time
when
people
said
do
it
do
it
walked
up
fifth
avenue
looking
up
for
lots
of
trouble
but
said
no
way
am
not
going
to
do
it
and
it
was
rough
time
as
you
know
it
was
and
it
was
tremendously
successful
parade
maybe
their
most
successful
parade
that
they
ever
had
so
in
different
position
than
the
other
candidates
because
the
one
candidate
want
any
of
your
money
want
your
support
but
want
your
money
my
campaign
been
an
amazing
experience
for
me
because
have
very
little
money
invested
so
far
thought
by
this
time
have
about
million
in
and
have
none
although
took
small
radio
commercial
the
other
day
in
but
we
have
virtually
no
money
in
invested
in
or
advertising
and
think
you
as
business
people
will
feel
pretty
good
about
this
and
respect
it
at
first
was
by
that
said
you
know
think
going
to
have
spend
money
just
to
spend
money
but
not
really
like
good
thing
to
do
because
am
in
first
place
by
lot
not
even
close
every
single
poll
every
single
state
the
numbers
just
came
in
three
minutes
ago
in
new
the
poll
trump
at
the
next
one
is
and
the
rest
are
off
the
board
they
have
to
drop
out
pretty
soon
guess
right
most
of
importantly
no
still
like
the
top
number
the
most
but
is
now
at
to
which
is
good
and
beat
in
the
fox
poll
as
you
see
very
easily
to
ultimately
the
most
important
and
you
know
been
tremendous
fan
and
been
tremendous
contributor
given
lot
of
money
recently
to
emergency
response
they
do
fantastic
job
and
my
father
was
always
big
supporter
so
grew
up
in
that
environment
grew
up
in
brooklyn
queens
and
israel
was
always
very
paramount
in
our
mind
in
fact
been
sometimes
because
received
so
many
awards
from
jewish
groups
and
they
look
at
my
wall
loaded
up
but
now
the
are
catching
up
have
to
tell
you
my
are
liking
me
lot
lately
and
been
great
they
have
been
great
so
is
the
worst
thing
ever
happened
to
israel
the
worst
the
worst
and
when
see
great
friends
of
mine
who
are
very
very
very
mean
they
love
israel
they
love
it
with
passion
and
having
fundraisers
for
said
what
are
you
doing
and
almost
like
they
answer
me
and
they
say
we
know
he
comes
to
new
york
we
know
we
know
said
disaster
really
believe
the
iran
deal
look
negotiator
like
you
folks
negotiators
we
build
gas
stations
in
the
middle
of
as
you
know
for
million
can
you
imagine
this
small
gas
station
million
and
then
they
used
the
wrong
kind
of
terminal
because
they
sell
that
type
of
gas
okay
million
for
gas
station
how
many
think
they
could
have
done
it
for
less
would
you
raise
your
hands
please
but
look
at
look
at
that
deal
where
we
gave
to
iran
billion
they
need
to
develop
nuclear
weapons
they
can
buy
them
they
can
buy
them
true
why
do
they
have
to
develop
them
they
can
buy
them
we
gave
them
billion
they
go
out
and
in
terms
of
you
know
surveillance
they
have
the
right
to
how
about
that
on
their
major
most
dangerous
they
can
going
to
let
them
and
then
you
have
of
course
the
days
and
the
days
all
good
with
contracts
start
until
such
and
such
happens
it
could
be
forever
before
you
ever
go
into
inspect
and
we
even
get
our
prisoners
back
and
now
they
want
to
start
negotiation
to
get
the
prisoners
back
and
they
want
people
for
our
three
they
want
to
give
us
our
four
you
know
we
have
four
but
they
only
want
to
talk
three
now
that
should
have
been
negotiated
right
at
the
beginning
three
years
ago
and
maybe
better
than
any
audience
mean
the
people
in
this
room
understand
what
saying
it
should
have
been
you
walk
in
by
the
way
did
you
ever
see
negotiation
take
so
long
and
we
conceded
on
every
single
we
win
anything
we
win
anything
but
that
should
have
been
with
our
prisoners
day
one
whatever
it
is
years
ago
we
have
to
get
our
prisoners
back
you
want
them
we
need
them
it
will
make
us
look
better
both
everybody
is
going
to
like
us
more
with
the
american
public
any
deal
that
we
strike
going
to
look
good
and
you
say
that
we
have
to
get
our
prisoners
back
day
one
going
to
say
no
not
giving
and
going
to
say
bye
bye
bye
call
us
when
ready
and
then
we
go
out
and
double
up
and
triple
up
the
sanctions
guarantee
you
within
hours
calling
begging
us
to
come
back
to
the
table
and
you
have
your
prisoners
back
so
easy
now
the
president
you
saw
that
and
john
who
is
probably
the
worst
negotiator
ever
seen
no
the
worst
negotiator
ever
seen
he
did
not
read
the
art
of
the
deal
folks
can
tell
you
that
now
one
of
the
few
one
of
the
biggest
selling
of
all
time
business
book
of
all
time
he
read
it
and
definitely
read
it
oh
but
they
said
this
is
hard
to
believe
but
this
is
what
they
said
lot
of
press
back
there
so
have
to
say
everything
exactly
correct
because
if
end
up
with
they
said
we
want
to
complicate
the
negotiations
by
asking
for
the
prisoners
really
complicated
we
want
our
prisoners
back
oh
so
complicated
they
said
they
want
to
complicate
so
now
going
to
end
up
making
new
deal
probably
at
some
point
tell
you
this
look
just
tell
you
this
if
win
before
take
office
guarantee
you
those
prisoners
are
going
to
be
back
going
to
be
back
guarantee
you
going
to
be
back
now
our
president
want
to
use
the
term
we
had
another
event
which
probably
was
the
one
yesterday
probably
was
related
it
always
happens
but
it
probably
was
when
heard
about
it
figured
maybe
not
but
it
turns
out
probably
was
related
radical
islamic
terrorism
and
tell
you
what
we
have
president
that
refuses
to
use
the
term
he
refuses
to
say
something
going
on
with
him
that
we
know
about
now
as
far
as
concerned
going
to
go
with
what
he
wants
she
be
allowed
to
run
what
she
did
is
criminal
with
the
she
be
allowed
to
run
going
to
have
to
follow
his
line
because
on
thread
you
know
look
in
real
life
his
attorney
general
his
attorney
his
attorney
general
so
his
attorney
general
is
going
to
listen
to
him
in
my
opinion
think
very
dishonest
going
on
with
our
government
david
was
given
sentence
other
people
have
been
sent
to
jail
was
you
know
essentially
look
want
to
get
into
it
with
the
poor
guy
what
he
went
for
nothing
compared
to
what
she
did
for
nothing
for
of
what
she
did
and
mean
she
go
against
him
because
only
does
boom
she
gets
indicted
the
end
of
it
the
end
of
it
so
when
you
see
backing
up
virtually
everything
he
says
and
got
control
of
her
mean
just
total
control
but
tell
you
what
she
be
allowed
to
run
what
she
did
was
criminal
act
and
remember
this
this
is
you
have
six
year
statute
of
limitations
so
fighting
for
her
life
if
she
become
president
she
could
have
real
problem
does
that
make
any
sense
to
anybody
does
that
make
sense
to
anybody
because
what
she
did
was
just
wrong
okay
and
you
know
been
involved
in
corruption
her
whole
life
whether
mean
her
whole
life
is
corruption
she
was
horrible
secretary
of
state
she
did
horrible
job
other
than
lot
she
lot
nothing
ever
got
done
the
whole
the
world
blew
up
around
her
it
blew
up
to
calls
and
and
everything
from
our
ambassador
asking
for
help
and
she
respond
the
truth
is
she
have
the
strength
or
the
energy
she
responded
to
her
friends
you
know
the
friends
talking
about
some
of
those
friends
are
you
know
sort
of
an
interesting
friend
going
on
there
but
she
responded
yeah
you
get
that
right
lot
of
people
get
that
but
she
responded
to
friend
but
she
respond
to
an
ambassador
asking
for
help
hundreds
hundreds
of
requests
and
she
respond
now
remember
this
go
every
night
to
mean
yesterday
was
in
virginia
we
had
an
unbelievable
crowd
the
other
day
was
in
florida
we
had
people
in
at
with
the
football
games
going
on
people
the
convention
held
so
we
had
thousands
outside
made
outside
made
two
said
you
get
me
larger
convention
so
can
do
one
my
people
said
no
this
is
the
biggest
one
we
set
record
big
record
we
set
record
everywhere
we
beat
the
record
of
john
true
john
no
longer
competing
with
politicians
competing
with
the
musical
talent
one
of
the
great
musicians
said
you
get
the
largest
crowds
of
any
single
human
being
on
earth
without
guitar
meaning
who
count
on
music
so
true
had
tremendous
response
had
incredible
response
think
you
know
if
you
look
at
going
on
and
think
based
on
the
response
based
on
the
polls
again
want
your
money
therefore
probably
not
going
to
support
me
because
stupidly
you
want
to
give
money
trump
want
money
therefore
we
even
though
better
than
all
these
guys
even
though
going
to
do
more
for
israel
than
anybody
else
even
though
asked
me
to
do
commercial
for
him
and
did
and
he
won
his
race
so
was
very
happy
about
that
but
he
asked
me
to
do
commercial
and
they
said
was
the
only
celebrity
know
if
but
they
said
the
only
celebrity
know
not
celebrity
see
now
politician
so
embarrassed
by
that
term
you
know
my
how
life
been
business
been
developer
employed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
over
my
lifetime
have
unbelievable
statements
and
unbelievable
company
lot
of
people
said
oh
never
file
this
get
kick
out
of
never
run
because
never
want
to
file
various
papers
and
then
never
file
this
and
that
and
then
have
to
sign
your
life
away
the
first
paper
we
all
know
about
first
papers
you
sign
your
life
away
the
end
of
it
he
did
it
then
they
said
well
never
sign
and
never
file
his
because
who
knows
maybe
not
as
rich
as
people
think
so
filed
my
almost
pages
the
biggest
ever
filed
by
the
federal
elections
and
everybody
said
oh
my
much
bigger
and
much
stronger
and
holy
look
at
these
numbers
run
probably
would
have
filed
anyways
because
you
know
built
great
company
and
like
to
brag
about
it
whenever
possible
true
some
of
the
greatest
assets
you
know
and
in
scotland
and
trump
tower
and
many
buildings
in
just
many
bank
of
america
building
in
san
with
great
partner
and
so
many
other
buildings
and
and
the
reason
bring
that
up
is
because
the
kind
of
thinking
we
need
and
bring
it
up
as
bring
it
up
because
the
kind
of
thinking
we
need
in
this
country
to
bring
us
back
we
have
people
that
know
the
first
thing
about
the
word
negotiation
can
take
anybody
in
this
office
believe
me
and
better
than
and
better
than
and
better
than
the
foolish
people
the
foolish
people
so
embarrassing
when
you
see
what
happens
sergeant
all
right
sergeant
we
get
traitor
they
get
five
of
the
greatest
killers
that
wanted
for
nine
years
you
know
the
deal
was
five
for
one
and
they
knew
he
was
traitor
before
we
made
the
deal
you
know
about
sergeant
he
deserted
six
people
were
killed
trying
to
get
him
back
they
were
looking
for
him
the
general
and
the
colonel
went
to
see
all
those
people
they
said
no
he
deserted
he
was
traitor
and
we
still
made
the
deal
so
we
get
traitor
we
can
give
him
back
do
you
want
to
deals
some
of
us
will
deals
would
say
about
is
there
anybody
that
deals
in
this
room
this
room
negotiates
so
want
to
perhaps
more
than
any
room
than
ever
spoken
maybe
more
okay
been
called
on
that
couple
of
times
too
but
the
fact
is
want
to
renegotiate
that
deal
want
to
drop
him
right
smack
in
the
middle
of
where
he
came
from
the
hell
they
can
have
him
even
if
we
get
the
five
guys
back
because
not
going
to
happen
because
you
know
where
they
are
right
now
right
now
all
in
the
battlefield
fighting
us
and
trying
to
kill
us
and
kill
anybody
that
gets
in
so
they
get
their
five
guys
that
wanted
for
nine
years
wanted
them
and
we
get
dirty
rotten
traitor
but
the
way
our
people
negotiate
stupid
people
okay
stupid
people
very
sad
very
sad
so
just
tell
you
that
going
to
win
am
going
to
win
mean
unless
something
happens
you
know
walk
across
the
street

secret
service

one
number

they
give
you
secret
service
never
saw
so
many
people
talented
people
great
people
but
believe
going
to
win
really
have
just
great
feeling
about
it
and
you
know
my
life
has
been
about
winning
won
and
my
life
has
been
about
winning
and
what
want
to
do
for
the
country
and
if
people
say
about
my
company
and

and
you
can
do
this
deal
or
that
deal
have
no
interest
like

other
day

these
republican
politicians
they
go
to
washington

going
to
end
which
going
to
do
by
the
way
ending
terminating

at
the
angels

at
these
magnificent
floors

is
incredible
and
then
they
become
mainstream
vote
on
yes
vote
they
want
to
leave
they
lose
all
of
their
courage
want
to
use
nice
word
because
otherwise

reported
for
foul
language
they
lose
all
of
their
courage
and
let
us
down
that
happen
with
me
so

his
low
energy

the
people

want
to
give
me

okay
but

hey
five
months

with
you
better

is
better
than
me

to
the
republican
governors
association
never
even
gotten
letter
of
thank
you
true
receive
one
letter
not

letter
from
one
governor
stupid
the
good
thing
is
give
any
why
would
give
any
more
you
get
thank
you
letter
politicians
remember
this
politicians
forget
politicians
generally
competent
and
the
one
thing
they
are
good
at
is
getting
elected
and
what
going
to
end
up
having
but
would
love
your
support
but
want
your
money
appreciate
it
now
take
some
questions
okay
good
going
to
go
there
right
after
this
have
to
go
through
you
know
you
have
to
watch
to
make
sure
that
the
contractors
stealing
and
ripping
you
off
and
everything
else
but
to
show
you
how
important
this
forum
is
and
how
important
the
country
is
to
me
and
how
important
israel
is
to
me
so
important
mention
my
projects
not
like
very
important
to
me
anymore
really
important
to
me
is
the
united
states
and
making
it
great
again
my
theme
is
make
america
great
again
mean
taken
off
like
crazy
the
hats
going
crazy
but
you
know
some
of
these
guys
try
to
copy
it
but
had
it
trademarked
because
smart
couple
of
them
got
up
no
you
see
was
making
this
and
everybody
stood
up
make
america
great
but
nobody
stood
up
to
them
but
we
sent
them
little
notice
use
that
term
trademarked
can
you
imagine
got
the
approval
but
we
are
building
great
hotel
down
the
road
hope
you
all
stay
and
going
to
be
was
interviewed
yesterday
by
whole
group
of
reporters
from
and
they
did
very
good
job
very
fair
story
and
one
of
the
questions
was
about
israel
and
the
going
to
happen
said
used
that
as
an
example
of
some
deals
that
are
maybe
the
hardest
deal
ever
in
history
to
we
think
of
any
deals
we
all
have
tough
deals
right
you
know
we
have
some
good
some
but
said
people
are
going
to
have
to
make
sacrifices
one
way
or
the
other
believe
because
believe
that
can
put
both
sides
together
but
said
take
six
months
at
the
end
of
six
months
and
maybe
sooner
with
us
we
have
deal
instinct
lot
of
us
and
you
can
walk
into
room
and
you
can
almost
tell
like
in
two
seconds
whether
or
not
going
to
make
deal
will
know
very
quickly
whether
or
not
be
able
to
put
that
deal
together
used
that
in
this
interview
as
an
example
of
perhaps
the
hardest
deal
in
history
to
put
together
probably
no
tougher
deal
if
could
do
that
it
would
make
me
so
happy
because
so
much
violence
so
much
death
and
just
been
going
on
for
so
many
years
now
said
you
have
to
have
commitment
to
make
it
know
that
israel
has
the
commitment
to
make
it
and
know
that
the
other
side
has
the
commitment
to
make
it
with
that
being
said
you
know
have
good
chance
of
winning
because
you
look
at
going
on
so
have
good
chance
like
to
as
give
away
lot
of
cards
by
talking
about
how
feel
about
this
or
that
rather
save
it
for
that
moment
when
you
walk
into
the
room
want
one
side
or
the
other
saying
look
think
people
know
where
stand
but
it
be
great
if
they
could
make
deal
but
lasting
deal
real
deal
not
phony
deal
going
to
last
week
and
then
bad
things
started
happening
again
love
to
and
will
give
it
you
know
as
you
know
he
said
it
happen
meaning
he
gave
up
on
this
before
it
even
started
but
think
it
would
be
great
thing
for
israel
think
it
would
be
great
actually
for
both
sides
if
real
deal
could
be
made
and
going
to
give
it
my
best
great
what
do
made
lot
of
money
going
to
give
it
my
best
it
would
be
great
if
that
deal
could
be
made
by
the
way
israel
has
given
lot
of
people
know
that
think
the
public
relations
for
israel
been
so
great
because
given
lot
but
been
given
lot
of
credit
for
what
in
fact
some
things
have
been
given
which
were
unthinkable
and
lot
of
turmoil
it
caused
in
israel
there
were
things
given
but
like
to
go
in
with
clean
slate
and
just
say
go
even
we
love
everybody
and
see
if
we
could
do
something
but
do
think
this
and
do
think
right
from
the
beginning
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
saying
it
now
even
though
perhaps
it
comes
back
to
haunt
me
later
on
it
has
to
be
said
that
israel
has
given
lot
know
whether
or
not
they
want
to
go
that
far
in
little
step
and
you
know
going
to
be
up
to
them
but
israel
has
not
been
given
the
credit
that
they
deserve
for
what
done
will
say
that
will
say
that
so
it
you
know
what
want
to
do
want
to
wait
until
meet
with
you
know
leaving
for
israel
in
very
short
period
of
time
know
know
what
saying
just
not
going
to
be
the
wise
guy
do
me
just
relax
okay
like
me
very
much
believe
me
okay
and
you
wonder
why
you
get
yourself
in
trouble
all
right
going
to
like
me
very
much
going
to
be
fine
but
again
you
go
in
with
that
if
going
to
make
deal
and
you
could
make
great
deal
you
go
in
with
the
attitude
going
to
shove
it
down
got
to
go
in
and
get
it
and
do
it
and
do
it
nicely
so
happy
worry
about
it
going
to
be
very
happy
okay
worry
about
it
think
very
good
man
think
been
treated
very
badly
think
that
our
president
has
been
unbelievably
rude
to
know
how
many
people
like
but
think
been
unbelievably
rude
and
mean
talk
about
deals
after
the
fact
which
is
shame
but
think
the
iran
deal
is
the
worst
single
thing
perhaps
go
down
and
been
pretty
good
at
predicting
things
think
going
to
go
down
as
the
worst
single
thing
ever
happened
to
israel
think
catastrophe
for
israel
and
think
the
fact
that
was
willing
to
make
that
deal
for
anybody
that
loves
israel
to
support
this
guy
or
even
the
democratic
party
is
impossible
to
believe
think
it
will
be
one
of
the
great
catastrophes
but
if
get
in
will
straighten
it
out
believe
me
going
to
be
straightened
out
going
to
be
straightened
out
tough
and
going
to
be
straightened
out
fast
the
one
bad
thing
is
if
get
in
the
billion
is
gone
that
hurts
me
and
that
hurts
the
people
of
israel
but
the
billion
is
gone
because
be
gone
before
you
get
there
you
know
talking
about
year
and
more
actually
although
the
election
very
quick
you
know
coming
up
now
less
than
year
and
you
know
we
have
the
starts
on
february
and
then
we
go
right
down
the
line
and
very
exciting
talking
about
couple
of
months
now
for
it
to
start
for
person
like
me
mean
very
exciting
well
been
working
too
much
with
the
arab
leaders
to
be
honest
with
you
okay
you
know
told
you
made
commercials
for
know
if
going
to
help
me
in
the
negotiation
can
tell
you
you
know
trying
to
keep
it
nice
and
level
right
then
get
people
screaming
at
me
but
trying
to
keep
it
as
level
as
possible
but
for
the
most
part
know
the
king
of
seems
like
nice
man
mean
know
going
to
see
lot
of
people
like
him
some
people
but
think
will
probably
be
able
what
my
history
you
know
took
some
heat
because
get
along
with
democrats
get
along
with
liberals
get
along
with
conservatives
get
along
with
republicans
get
along
with
everybody
what
was
get
along
with
everybody
we
have
to
get
along
with
everybody
and
took
some
heat
and
always
explained
that
said
wait
minute
got
to
get
along
with
everybody
live
in
all
democrat
mean
virtually
all
republicans
even
run
people
for
the
most
part
and
if
they
do
they
get
you
know
they
get
very
small
percentage
of
the
vote
got
to
get
along
with
everybody
think
going
to
be
tremendous
asset
because
right
now
we
have
gridlock
in
washington
we
have
people
that
they
talk
you
know
remember
that
years
ago
because
been
very
political
person
on
the
other
side
but
always
very
political
but
years
ago
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
they
used
to
like
each
other
get
along
have
dinner
together
argue
and
fight
and
disagree
and
would
have
you
know
different
views
and
things
but
in
the
evening
go
out
and
have
dinner
together
with
their
families
you
see
that
anymore
total
hatred
and
total
gridlock
give
you
one
point
which
think
is
important
corporate
inversions
right
so
you
have
companies
leaving
the
united
states
and
leaving
because
of
better
taxes
and
better
lot
of
things
lot
of
things
are
better
but
leaving
how
good
is
thousands
and
thousands
of
jobs
are
going
to
be
lost
but
also
leaving
because
we
have
trillion
at
least
think
much
higher
number
than
that
trillion
out
of
the
country
that
these
companies
get
back
because
of
bureaucracy
and
horrible
trade
agreements
but
because
the
taxes
are
too
high
so
onerous
that
nobody
in
this
room
would
agree
to
pay
that
much
money
to
get
your
money
out
so
they
leave
it
over
there
and
they
actually
take
the
company
and
they
move
the
company
to
the
money
because
how
much
money
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
totally
agree
that
the
money
should
come
back
for
three
years
they
get
deal
no
leadership
gridlock
an
example
of
something
where
everybody
agrees
all
the
people
that
you
see
up
here
they
all
agree
but
they
get
it
done
because
politicians
all
talk
no
action
so
something
and
so
important
not
like
something
where
they
get
like
big
disputes
and
we
understand
that
this
is
something
everybody
agrees
the
money
should
pour
into
this
country
and
we
should
use
the
money
and
all
the
things
taxes
paid
but
they
agree
and
they
get
it
because
of
gridlock
and
incompetent
leadership
you
know
honestly
think
anybody
can
say
she
says
she
is
but
now
she
says
all
of
sudden
maybe
less
so
than
you
thought
because
going
very
very
far
over
to
the
other
side
mean
has
brought
her
to
positions
that
she
want
to
be
at
you
look
at
some
of
the
things
that
saying
right
now
but
tell
you
what
whether
she
is
or
not
she
have
the
strength
or
the
energy
to
help
israel
telling
you
she
just
take
look
come
out
and
do
an
event
and
you
see
her
for
another
four
days
three
days
five
days
no
true
think
of
it
we
need
some
people
say
not
nice
to
say
she
have
the
strength
or
the
energy
israel
needs
more
than
just
our
support
they
need
strength
they
need
real
power
behind
them
because
you
know
you
look
at
as
these
countries
fall
over
there
looking
more
and
more
you
know
israel
has
some
difficulties
and
one
thing
and
think
all
admit
it
these
people
are
fighting
really
dirty
but
they
fight
lot
better
than
we
used
to
think
right
we
used
to
think
oh
that
was
easy
years
ago
with
my
friends
from
israel
because
have
lot
of
friends
from
israel
they
used
to
smile
and
laugh
oh
worry
about
it
now
saying
these
guys
are
dirty
fighters
and
not
bad
you
know
tough
not
the
okay
said
the
not
the
folks
we
need
tough
we
need
general
george
we
need
general
we
need
the
guys
we
have
see
them
on
television
generals
want
my
generals
on
television
saying
well
isis
is
very
tough
saw
guy
the
other
day
isis
is
very
tough
know
need
that
do
you
think
general
george
they
like
him
because
he
was
foul
mouth
vicious
horrible
brilliant
guy
so
he
would
never
make
it
they
probably
would
have
had
him
thrown
out
years
ago
but
we
need
we
need
genius
like
and
we
have
those
people
we
have
those
people
find
that
person
but
going
to
knock
the
crap
out
of
them
tell
you
what
going
to
win
going
to
win
going
to
win
well
think
radical
islam
right
now
is
and
feel
the
greatest
and
again
we
have
president
who
refuses
to
use
the
term
but
radical
islam
is
tell
you
one
thing
know
is
global
warming
the
one
know
mean
we
have
guy
that
just
the
other
day
who
said
here
they
want
to
blow
everything
this
is
right
after
paris
they
want
to
blow
our
cities
up
they
want
to
destroy
our
and
worried
about
global
warming
which
lot
of
people
think
is
hoax
by
the
way
won
so
many
environmental
awards
shockingly
no
true
and
you
know
what
want
to
do
want
really
immaculate
air
want
clean
crystal
water
want
lot
of
things
okay
want
lot
of
things
but
global
warming
you
noticed
they
changed
the
name
they
go
global
warming
they
go
climate
change
they
go
now
hear
lot
of
extreme
weather
how
can
you
miss
with
extreme
weather
right
if
cold
okay
if
hot
okay
if
windy
if
hot
everything
is
extreme
so
now
they
use
extreme
weather
it
is
disgrace
going
on
and
to
have
this
man
embarrass
us
by
standing
up
and
saying
that
global
warming
is
our
biggest
threat
we
got
to
get
him
out
so
fast
and
thank
goodness
we
only
have
year
left
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
great
want
to
thank
and
one
of
the
most
magnificent
publishers
for
years
and
years
heard
about
and
being
fabulous
was
going
to
say
the
was
going
to
say
the
harvard
or
the
yale
but
they
really
are
great
one
and
want
to
thank
you
very
much
given
us
such
tremendous
support
and
we
did
this
quickly
and
think
we
did
it
very
effectively
been
an
incredible
experience
we
wrote
book
and
the
title
crippled
america
is
very
tough
but
unfortunately
we
have
to
do
what
we
have
to
do
and
think
one
of
the
reasons
been
doing
so
well
in
the
campaign
is
because
we
tell
it
like
it
is
we
tell
the
truth
and
america
is
crippled
we
owe
trillion
and
now
trillion
and
now
actually
very
soon
going
to
be
trillion
in
debt
we
have
military
that
have
proper
instruction
from
leadership
we
know
what
doing
losing
all
over
the
world
with
trade
deals
every
country
no
matter
what
country
you
talk
about
you
can
just
pick
name
out
of
hat
beating
us
in
trade
and
we
go
on
like
this
any
longer
impossible
to
go
on
like
this
any
longer
always
mention
as
an
example
sergeant
traitor
we
get
sergeant
they
get
five
of
the
people
they
wanted
and
they
wanted
badly
and
not
the
way
going
to
work
anymore
so
we
write
about
it
in
the
book
we
tell
lots
of
different
stories
of
lots
of
different
things
and
think
going
to
be
very
instructional
very
important
to
me
it
was
instructional
when
did
the
art
of
the
deal
think
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
so
successful
is
that
it
was
largely
instructional
even
today
when
speak
so
many
people
hold
up
the
book
the
art
of
the
deal
and
the
other
books
done
so
this
is
one
that
probably
not
since
the
art
of
the
deal
have
to
tell
this
to
and
and
have
worked
so
hard
on
book
and
it
was
in
confined
period
of
time
we
wanted
to
get
it
out
really
really
quickly
so
that
it
pertain
to
going
on
right
now
moment
of
time
and
we
got
it
done
and
david
did
fantastic
all
of
my
people
did
great
job
they
helped
me
so
much
because
we
are
doing
couple
of
other
things
right
now
so
this
was
not
easy
getting
this
in
but
we
see
by
the
lines
the
lines
go
down
to
park
avenue
been
forming
since
last
night
and
going
to
be
signing
books
starting
at
doing
couple
of
interviews
and
then
signing
books
starting
at
and
be
very
exciting
for
me
but
we
have
fans
that
have
bought
the
book
and
they
just
bought
it
and
some
have
been
now
for
and
hours
know
how
doing
this
but
they
do
it
they
find
way
so
looking
forward
to
getting
to
the
signings
well
think
different
book
you
know
we
just
had
polls
come
out
today
from
where
leading
you
saw
the
new
poll
from
you
saw
the
new
poll
in
new
where
leading
big
poll
just
came
out
in
florida
where
leading
big
georgia
texas
mean
all
over
the
place
and
think
you
know
look
doing
well
and
if
you
add
ben
and
myself
beating
everybody
by
lot
that
seems
to
be
the
big
story
that
beating
they
call
it
the
establishment
called
really
the
failed
establishment
because
the
establishment
has
let
us
down
but
know
know
how
his
book
is
doing
well
think
my
book
is
very
his
is
different
kind
of
book
and
different
kind
of
person
my
book
is
very
it
says
it
like
it
is
and
based
on
what
and
just
told
me
selling
like
so
see
very
different
people
we
have
very
different
qualities
and
we
are
extremely
different
and
different
from
all
of
the
other
candidates
look
nobody
can
negotiate
trade
deals
like
me
we
are
going
to
take
the
billion
year
that
losing
with
china
going
to
be
turned
around
the
billion
year
that
short
on
with
japan
the
billion
year
that
we
lost
to
mexico
and
right
there
will
be
wall
built
it
will
go
up
it
will
be
built
and
people
will
come
into
the
country
legally
so
mean
much
different
than
look
at
very
very
weak
on
illegal
immigration
you
look
at
ben
and
very
weak
on
immigration
and
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
mean
ben
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
get
rid
of
be
horrible
thing
to
get
rid
of
it
actually
works
you
get
rid
of
the
fraud
waste
and
abuse
it
works
so
when
man
is
weak
on
immigration
and
wants
to
get
rid
of
know
how
he
stays
here
no
think
that
really
is
and
frankly
had
bush
been
better
messenger
he
has
the
better
message
mean
if
that
was
me
delivering
that
message
it
would
have
been
much
different
story
because
he
been
able
to
show
up
to
the
united
states
senate
representing
the
people
of
florida
which
by
the
way
that
poll
just
came
out
today
and
way
up
in
florida
over
everybody
but
is
sitting
senator
and
he
show
up
for
the
people
of
florida
and
think
he
should
be
doing
that
now
bush
gave
very
weak
message
agree
with
that
it
was
poorly
delivered
but
the
facts
are
on
side
and
ultimately
think
going
to
be
hurt
very
badly
and
if
you
look
at
singer
you
have
to
see
where
singer
is
coming
from
and
when
you
see
where
coming
from
think
people
are
going
to
say
whoa
we
know
that
but
look
at
stance
on
illegal
immigration
really
trouble
for
him
see
how
he
can
win
personal
finances
are
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
his
credit
card
mean
he
is
disaster
with
his
credit
cards
and
tell
you
what
love
florida
in
florida
all
the
time
and
for
years
been
hearing
that
his
credit
cards
are
disaster
would
think
that
when
you
take
look
at
it
you
would
find
that
but
his
credit
card
debt
and
his
problems
with
credit
card
and
what
he
did
when
he
was
running
the
party
apparatus
with
credit
cards
heard
about
it
for
years
have
to
find
out
well
he
has
very
bad
record
of
finances
if
you
look
at
what
happened
with
his
houses
with
his
you
know
he
certainly
lives
above
his
means
no
question
about
that
tell
you
what
on
the
debates
very
interesting
because
really
care
that
much
want
room
want
podium
and
get
going
because
really
care
that
much
but
lot
of
the
people
that
are
candidates
who
respect
many
of
them
not
all
of
them
but
respect
many
of
them
they
felt
it
was
very
unfair
because
was
given
all
soft
balls
mean
she
asked
one
tough
question
they
talk
about
her
foundation
they
talk
about
any
of
the
problems
they
talk
about
the
when
the
email
problem
came
up
lost
his
whole
campaign
mean
what
he
did
was
so
stupid
from
his
standpoint
in
order
to
get
of
some
applause
he
gave
up
the
that
was
end
of
his
campaign
first
of
all
people
going
to
his
rallies
anymore
finished
so
unless
something
happens
to
her
with
respect
to
the
easily
be
the
candidate
but
will
say
this
she
only
got
all
she
got
and
if
you
look
at
the
way
we
were
treated
it
the
same
way
with
that
being
said
really
care
well
think
the
republicans
actually
are
doing
pretty
good
job
overall
they
coalesced
at
that
last
debate
because
mean
it
really
started
with
me
the
guy
asked
me
question
think
is
probably
finished
as
credible
reporter
disaster
and
he
was
it
was
such
as
horribly
put
question
and
so
obvious
and
the
republicans
coalesced
around
each
other
it
was
actually
pretty
beautiful
when
you
think
about
it
and
all
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
treated
fairly
but
with
me
care
that
much
just
give
me
podium
what
would
say
is
this
the
networks
have
made
fortune
because
of
me
not
because
of
anybody
else
you
know
they
were
saying
that
the
last
cycle
they
had
million
and
million
people
and
the
networks
even
want
to
broadcast
it
because
nobody
watched
okay
nobody
wanted
to
watch
now
they
have
million
people
million
people
million
people
and
million
people
mean
give
me
break
so
somebody
said
how
did
they
get
there
and
actually
variety
and
reporter
who
do
report
this
stuff
pretty
well
much
better
than
the
political
press
they
said
solely
for
one
reason
it
was
trump
take
the
credit
but
tell
you
what
also
want
think
that
wounded
warriors
and
our
veterans
should
be
given
some
of
the
enormous
profits
being
made
on
these
debates
enormous
profits
by
the
way
beyond
anything
ever
envisioned
was
going
to
get
for
second
they
ended
up
getting
so
they
went
from
to
for
second
the
networks
and
the
cable
are
making
fortune
and
think
they
should
give
some
of
the
profits
to
the
wounded
warriors
and
the
veterans
what
want
giving
them
away
giving
the
profits
of
my
book
giving
them
away
to
lot
of
different
including
the
vets
have
been
amazing
with
respect
to
the
hiring
of
women
this
building
was
built
as
the
head
person
who
was
fantastic
by
woman
and
that
was
at
time
when
you
see
that
in
the
construction
trades
mean
it
was
totally
unique
have
many
many
executives
upstairs
and
in
different
buildings
that
have
that
are
women
many
proportion
close
to
might
even
be
over
if
it
and
they
get
paid
lot
of
money
in
many
cases
more
than
men
doing
the
same
job
so
women
have
always
appreciated
that
about
me
been
in
terms
of
employment
really
and
been
for
doing
so
well
with
women
what
bush
was
saying
at
the
last
debate
know
but
he
say
it
well
like
by
the
way
like
it
better
than
suing
for
million
the
country
is
doing
so
poorly
very
accurate
title
because
the
country
is
doing
so
poorly
good
going
to
have
some
demonstrations
oh
good
because
get
even
higher
ratings
if
they
do
that
think
fine
think
they
should
demonstrate
ratings
will
go
even
higher
than
they
are
going
to
be
going
to
be
one
of
the
highest
rated
shows
ever
and
very
excited
about
it
and
have
great
relationship
as
you
know
from
with
the
treated
me
actually
very
fairly
won
the
poll
recently
in
won
other
polls
and
in
think
got
and
leading
everybody
so
have
great
relationship
with
the
have
working
for
me
thousands
right
now
thousands
of
had
tens
of
thousands
of
people
over
the
year
working
for
me
job
machine
job
machine
and
one
of
the
things
that
does
come
out
in
every
single
poll
and
every
single
survey
is
that
nobody
for
the
economy
nobody
is
even
close
two
three
and
you
see
that
two
three
four
five
times
greater
than
anybody
else
and
almost
say
like
about
the
jobs
about
the
economy
then
anybody
going
to
beat
trump
in
all
fairness
but
had
great
relationship
with
the
workers
had
great
relationship
with
jobs
and
had
an
amazing
relationship
with
the
and
predict
that
going
to
win
the
hispanic
vote
think
going
to
win
the
hispanic
vote
predict
yeah
think
going
to
get
the
nomination
and
will
win
the
white
house
think
beating
is
going
to
be
easy
because
her
record
is
so
bad
the
question
like
how
am
preparing
for
my
well
meeting
with
in
little
while
afterwards
going
to
sign
guess
got
thousands
of
people
on
line
but
going
to
sign
and
then
later
on
this
evening
meeting
with
and
the
whole
staff
and
start
the
preparation
pick
our
skits
am
nervous
not
too
nervous
not
too
nervous
but
going
to
do
good
job
and
going
have
fantastic
show
all
going
to
have
lot
of
fun
my
impression
no
want
to
do
that
like
showing
person
sleeping
at
the
podium
is
asking
can
make
comeback
think
going
to
be
very
hard
very
hard
not
about
money
just
think
you
know
came
up
with
the
energy
and
just
think
we
need
tremendous
energy
because
we
need
person
that
has
tremendous
personal
energy
to
get
us
back
on
track
you
do
that
when
you
have
that
think
is
highly
overrated
highly
overrated
he
have
it
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
his
stance
on
things
he
lacks
the
quality
that
you
need
talking
about
everybody
in
the
world
is
ripping
us
off
you
need
very
strong
person
with
tremendous
energy
thank
you
very
much
folks
take
the
job
but
and
so
important
and
by
the
way
ben
does
not
have
that
energy
we
need
somebody
with
tremendous
energy
to
straighten
out
the
military
to
straighten
out
isis
to
straighten
out
our
horrible
trade
deals
to
terminate
and
come
up
with
something
far
better
for
far
less
money
you
need
somebody
with
tremendous
personal
energy
as
president
we
have
president
right
now
that
have
energy
mean
you
think
has
energy
he
has
no
energy
and
been
horrible
president
we
need
somebody
with
great
personal
energy
as
leader
so
that
we
can
make
great
deals
with
other
countries
and
do
well
in
every
other
respect
and
certainly
does
not
have
that
energy
in
my
opinion
from
the
guardian
ah
they
treat
me
very
nicely
in
scotland
go
ahead
well
we
just
went
over
that
honestly
we
just
went
over
that
and
only
going
to
make
it
harder
going
to
see
what
going
to
do
going
to
see
but
the
whole
thing
with
anchor
babies
turned
out
to
be
right
person
has
baby
lives
in
mexico
or
lives
in
asia
or
lives
in
many
different
place
has
baby
walks
across
the
border
has
the
baby
here
now
responsible
for
that
person
for
the
next
years
think
so
and
by
the
way
was
right
they
were
wrong
the
amendment
does
not
give
them
clearance
on
that
and
if
you
wanted
to
do
that
in
mexico
or
if
you
wanted
to
do
that
in
almost
any
other
country
where
you
have
baby
in
that
country
and
that
country
has
that
person
for
years
including
all
of
the
costs
of
that
person
they
would
laugh
you
right
out
of
the
country
you
would
be
laughed
out
of
the
country
so
fast
so
that
turned
out
was
right
have
to
worry
about
that
going
to
take
care
of
it
and
going
to
be
done
in
very
humane
way
but
going
to
bring
back
our
country
and
going
to
have
wall
and
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
and
you
know
why
going
to
pay
and
have
great
relationships
with
mexico
and
phenomenal
relationships
with
the
mexican
people
phenomenal
and
they
buy
apartments
from
me
they
work
for
me
by
the
thousands
by
the
thousands
phenomenal
relationships
but
let
me
just
tell
you
we
lose
so
much
money
with
mexico
in
terms
of
trade
imbalance
billion
last
year
plus
we
give
mexico
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
they
will
pay
for
the
wall
and
it
will
be
very
interesting
and
you
know
what
people
are
going
to
come
into
this
country
but
going
to
come
in
legally
lot
of
european
countries
are
going
to
build
walls
to
stop
the
immigration
well
walls
work
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
israel
walls
work
if
properly
constructed
not
the
walls
that
these
characters
these
politicians
that
we
have
running
our
country
who
are
disgrace
all
talk
no
action
politicians
they
build
wall
this
big
they
drive
cars
right
through
it
walls
work
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
and
see
israel
they
will
tell
you
that
walls
work
we
need
pomp
and
circumstance
our
country
has
no
spirit
our
country
has
no
gravitas
our
country
feel
good
about
itself
and
the
primary
reason
is
we
have
no
victories
mean
where
have
we
had
victory
where
have
we
had
victory
in
trade
where
have
we
had
victory
as
an
example
this
horrible
deal
that
was
signed
with
iran
where
given
them
billion
and
we
lose
everything
we
lose
everything
laughing
stock
worst
deal
worst
contract
ever
seen
drawn
we
have
no
victories
and
do
write
about
it
we
need
some
pomp
and
circumstance
we
need
spirit
we
need
cheerleader
thought
seven
years
ago
when
got
elected
the
one
thing
thought
that
he
would
be
great
cheerleader
for
this
country
not
been
great
divider
for
the
country
been
one
of
the
great
dividers
of
all
time
not
saying
dress
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
dress
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
what
he
says
is
very
divisive
he
has
been
great
divider
for
this
country
and
that
should
not
have
happened
go
anyway
they
want
care
too
much
about
the
debates
look
the
one
that
gets
all
the
nasty
questions
anyway
nobody
else
gets
the
really
nasty
questions
in
certain
way
maybe
defending
me
although
will
tell
you
not
doing
it
for
that
reason
think
irrelevant
just
like
the
debates
had
the
debates
done
well
in
the
debates
as
you
know
every
single
poll
said
won
all
three
debates
now
know
if
did
or
not
but
certainly
do
badly
but
every
single
poll
says
even
poll
said
won
the
debate
so
like
the
debates
think
good
for
me
but
we
have
to
be
treated
little
bit
fairly
as
an
example
no
tough
questions
mean
why
they
ask
about
bill
why
they
ask
about
all
of
the
different
things
no
tough
questions
now
that
was
staged
by
the
democrats
and
frankly
they
did
very
smart
thing
in
the
way
they
staged
it
well
going
to
stage
something
properly
also
but
as
far
as
concerned
really
care
that
much
just
want
debate
think
debating
is
good
thing
healthy
gets
everything
into
the
open
but
you
want
people
like
that
read
question
blah
blah
blah
that
he
wrote
that
he
carefully
wrote
he
thought
he
was
such
his
career
in
my
opinion
his
career
is
probably
ruined
or
certainly
threatened
he
could
ask
about
anything
you
want
mean
you
have
to
ask
about
anything
you
want
had
only
all
night
long
it
was
like
this
here
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
are
you
from
russia
all
right
think
our
relationship
with
russia
will
be
very
good
was
on
minutes
with
me
three
weeks
ago
right
and
they
have
one
of
the
highest
ratings
had
in
long
time
so
going
to
give
him
total
credit
but
we
will
have
very
good
relationship
think
with
russia
now
maybe
we
but
believe
we
will
have
very
good
relationship
with
russia
believe
that
will
have
very
good
relationship
with
sounds
okay
to
me
well
think
there
are
lot
of
economic
issues
we
talk
about
trade
we
talk
about
devaluations
right
we
talk
about
corporate
inversions
which
by
the
way
none
of
the
other
candidates
they
even
know
what
it
means
but
we
talk
about
corporate
inversions
where
companies
are
leaving
our
country
massive
companies
because
they
get
their
money
back
and
because
they
get
lower
taxes
elsewhere
so
leaving
and
taking
their
jobs
with
them
the
corporate
inversion
syndrome
is
very
important
thing
to
be
talking
about
these
were
all
things
that
talked
about
at
the
debate
instead
they
talked
about
football
mean
it
was
big
question
football
saying
what
about
corporate
inversions
trillion
at
least
think
probably
twice
that
number
is
in
other
countries
wanting
to
come
back
and
because
our
system
is
so
corrupt
and
terrible
they
get
the
money
back
to
invest
in
this
country
so
they
talk
about
corporate
inversions
at
the
debates
they
talk
about
football
those
are
the
few
was
against
the
war
in
iraq
you
know
it
was
very
early
on
give
it
to
you
yeah
have
it
well
you
know
you
have
to
understand
was
developer
lot
of
people
care
about
my
view
in
and
but
there
was
article
taken
from
magazine
about
my
stance
in
believe
in
july
of
and
it
talked
about
my
stance
on
how
felt
about
iraq
and
said
very
strongly
exactly
what
happened
said
you
will
the
middle
east
and
when
you
the
middle
east
iran
will
take
over
iraq
exactly
happening
and
they
will
take
over
the
oil
reserves
which
are
among
the
largest
in
the
world
and
in
addition
other
bad
things
will
happen
the
other
bad
things
are
isis
said
that
in
and
that
was
an
article
that
was
taken
from
magazine
which
was
previous
to
that
felt
that
for
long
time
think
that
time
for
some
of
the
other
republicans
in
the
race
that
registering
zero
in
couple
of
places
they
have
zero
with
an
arrow
pointing
left
which
assume
is
mistake
because
less
than
zero
assume
not
happening
do
think
time
to
have
some
of
the
other
republican
candidates
drop
out
yes
there
are
too
many
people
well
want
to
get
personal
but
you
can
look
at
the
poll
numbers
look
if
person
is
campaigning
for
four
or
five
months
and
at
or
or
they
should
get
out
like
you
know
look
at
me
go
to
florida
and
look
at
the
numbers
that
just
came
out
in
florida
georgia
mean
those
are
real
numbers
these
numbers
that
these
people
have
and
often
ask
myself
asked
mark
yesterday
what
are
they
doing
do
they
do
this
for
their
brand
because
happen
to
think
very
bad
for
their
brand
think
walker
did
good
thing
think
the
way
walker
he
saw
it
happening
going
to
happen
and
he
just
got
out
quickly
you
know
he
was
forget
you
know
that
was
before
trump
was
going
to
happen
right
but
he
was
for
period
of
time
walker
walker
they
thought
he
was
going
to
win
what
happened
is
he
got
out
think
the
way
he
got
out
was
great
think
he
did
really
smart
thing
for
himself
and
frankly
other
people
should
get
out
because
would
like
to
personally
have
more
time
to
talk
about
the
problems
of
the
united
states
and
more
importantly
how
we
can
solve
the
problems
so
great
question
people
should
get
out
oh
they
just
said
one
of
the
biggest
applause
lines
true
get
is
when
talk
about
my
daughter
she
was
just
at
fortune
magazine
for
like
something
like
woman
of
the
year
which
is
is
going
to
be
very
involved
and
is
going
to
be
very
involved
very
soon
going
to
be
coming
out
very
soon
oh
is
going
to
when
are
you
going
to
very
soon
would
say
see
threats
mean
whatever
it
is
have
to
do
mark
is
saying
what
are
the
top
threats
to
your
candidacy
who
knows
mean
in
the
crazy
world
of
politics
people
change
their
minds
going
to
make
america
great
again
nobody
else
is
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
going
to
do
it
going
to
make
it
in
my
opinion
better
than
ever
before
and
think
awfully
tough
to
compete
with
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
in
my
book
actually
put
in
there
showed
some
of
the
developments
that
have
many
many
more
because
you
can
only
and
you
actually
kept
me
to
eight
or
nine
pages
right
and
there
are
four
or
five
in
page
but
show
some
of
the
great
developments
that
have
done
that
are
so
successful
and
so
incredible
and
so
financially
good
show
my
financial
statement
from
year
and
half
two
years
ago
now
even
better
but
we
have
that
certified
yet
so
do
that
not
in
way
do
that
because
the
kind
of
thinking
our
country
needs
right
now
we
are
run
by
people
that
are
incompetent
we
are
run
by
people
who
in
so
many
words
hate
to
use
the
word
stupid
but
you
have
to
use
that
word
unless
they
have
bad
intentions
which
believe
they
do
but
we
are
run
by
incompetent
people
we
have
incompetent
leadership
there
are
so
many
things
like
mentioned
corporate
inversion
the
democrats
want
the
money
to
come
back
who
the
republicans
want
the
money
to
come
back
for
three
years
the
democrats
have
said
we
want
the
money
to
come
back
for
three
years
the
democrats
and
the
republicans
agree
you
have
vast
majority
maybe
everybody
for
three
years
guess
what
they
done
anything
right
they
even
get
along
when
they
agree
so
the
thing
where
we
can
take
trillions
of
dollars
bring
it
back
to
this
country
rebuild
big
parts
of
our
country
with
it
companies
can
spend
that
money
in
our
country
we
have
everybody
agrees
it
should
be
done
for
years
and
they
do
it
part
of
the
problem
well
going
to
look
lot
of
controversy
with
singer
lot
of
controversy
with
singer
there
are
those
people
that
probably
have
want
him
to
back
but
see
talk
to
you
no
they
all
agree
they
all
agree
they
just
want
to
go
through
the
unfair
questions
because
they
questions
they
were
statements
you
see
they
were
asking
they
were
giving
statements
in
sarcastic
disgusting
way
and
by
the
way
think
is
terrific
and
think
is
terrific
but
think
john
is
not
very
good
at
what
he
does
but
think
quick
is
terrific
person
think
is
terrific
person
but
will
tell
you
john
was
disgrace
to
question
is
should
the
fed
raise
rates
they
are
not
raising
them
because
has
asked
them
not
to
raise
them
in
my
opinion
he
wants
to
get
out
of
office
because
we
are
in
bubble
and
when
those
rates
are
raised
lot
of
bad
things
are
going
to
happen
or
potentially
going
to
happen
and
in
my
opinion
is
highly
political
and
not
raising
rates
for
very
specific
reason
because
told
her
not
to
because
he
wants
to
be
out
playing
golf
in
year
from
now
and
he
wants
to
be
doing
other
things
and
he
want
to
see
big
bubble
burst
during
his
administration
should
have
raised
the
rates
not
doing
it
because
the
administration
and
the
president
want
her
to
and
if
she
does
it
you
see
what
happens
every
time
even
thought
of
raising
them
just
little
bit
and
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
is
our
currency
right
now
is
not
competitive
with
other
currencies
because
if
you
look
at
the
devaluations
of
china
of
japan
of
many
many
different
countries
making
it
impossible
for
our
companies
to
compete
with
them
because
we
have
leaders
that
know
how
to
say
to
china
do
that
do
that
because
if
you
do
that
going
to
put
big
fat
tax
on
you
do
that
and
you
know
what
if
you
said
that
they
do
it
if
you
have
the
right
really
focused
on
one
very
big
election
one
very
important
election
and
there
are
some
pretty
good
elections
not
watching
any
of
them
in
particular
be
watching
them
on
tuesday
night
but
be
out
there
be
out
voting
but
the
election
that
watching
is
the
election
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
that
is
going
to
be
in
my
opinion
this
will
be
truly
one
of
the
most
important
elections
ever
had
in
this
country
so
far
behind
and
we
can
not
go
another
four
years
with
incompetent
leadership
good
question
okay
so
and
came
up
to
me
they
wanted
to
do
book
they
wanted
to
do
on
success
and
how
do
you
do
this
and
how
do
you
build
it
and
what
the
book
is
largely
about
but
we
talked
so
much
about
the
country
and
said
do
it
but
we
have
to
talk
about
the
country
what
happened
is
they
sent
this
incredible
photographer
up
to
do
book
cover
do
to
picture
and
he
did
some
smiling
happy
look
good
everything
was
fine
and
then
he
took
one
where
like
really
thinking
about
photo
and
then
it
turned
out
to
be
nasty
picture
and
then
the
book
was
written
and
the
title
was
given
and
the
only
really
terrible
picture
had
was
that
one
terrible
horrible
nasty
picture
but
when
talking
about
crippled
america
and
talking
about
all
of
the
problems
we
have
have
big
face
up
there
so
how
we
picked
it
we
picked
the
worst
photo
taken
of
me
would
have
loved
to
have
beautiful
smiling
picture
but
somehow
that
go
with
the
title
of
the
book
or
frankly
the
content
of
the
book
and
actually
and
agreed
with
me
okay
are
the
other
republicans
afraid
to
debate
well
some
of
them
should
be
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
was
telling
some
of
the
folks
backstage
never
ever
thought
do
this
well
this
fast
this
has
been
so
incredible
happened
all
over
happened
in
been
really
incredible
had
some
amazing
results
and
they
continue
to
come
in
got
little
in
know
going
on
somebody
said
are
you
going
straight
to
new
now
love
new
got
great
numbers
to
good
but
we
fell
little
behind
in
and
some
people
are
saying
how
can
it
be
and
come
out
and
was
just
telling
group
we
have
the
biggest
crowds
we
have
the
most
enthusiastic
crowds
everybody
said
and
very
true
mean
look
at
this
somebody
else
would
come
have
like
people
and
they
need
this
room
believe
me
but
everybody
said
without
question
in
every
poll
this
just
here
that
the
people
that
are
with
trump
are
with
trump
they
go
anywhere
staying
true
see
it
see
it
and
seen
it
you
know
couple
of
times
say
well
that
could
be
the
end
then
they
do
something
and
points
up
the
craziest
thing
right
but
take
it
but
they
say
the
people
are
with
we
have
the
most
loyal
people
by
far
everybody
says
it
the
other
thing
they
say
is
for
leadership
number
one
very
important
right
you
think
leadership
mean
when
leadership
is
number
one
they
say
on
the
economy
without
question
number
one
and
by
lot
so
you
know
great
thought
talk
little
bit
and
want
to
take
some
questions
you
know
we
can
do
little
question
and
answer
right
we
have
all
these
cameras
going
back
here
and
you
know
always
tough
when
on
live
television
all
the
time
look
we
have
topics
right
how
many
topics
how
many
different
ways
can
you
talk
about
the
topics
the
bottom
line
is
we
want
results
we
want
to
get
it
done
but
when
on
live
television
all
the
time
all
those
people
back
there
and
the
cameras
are
on
and
then
talking
about
immigration
and
talking
about
the
wall
because
going
to
have
wall
and
going
to
stop
illegal
immigration
but
we
talk
about
trade
and
we
talk
about
repealing
and
we
talk
about
all
the
things
that
we
talk
about
but
you
know
you
have
these
points
and
we
could
talk
about
them
in
different
forms
in
different
ways
and
give
different
examples
but
in
the
end
really
about
results
it
really
about
results
and
you
can
only
talk
about
the
same
subjects
on
live
television
so
many
different
ways
talk
about
industry
talk
about
commerce
talk
about
how
losing
our
jobs
to
all
of
these
different
countries
and
give
different
examples
but
still
going
to
be
certain
number
of
subjects
talk
about
second
amendment
talk
about
fourteenth
amendment
we
talk
about
amendments
you
know
that
second
amendment
they
want
to
take
it
away
from
you
they
really
want
to
do
things
and
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
at
least
with
me
not
going
to
happen
that
can
tell
you
so
said
today
you
know
talk
for
little
while
but
want
to
do
some
questions
and
answers
want
you
people
to
excite
me
for
change
is
that
okay
want
to
be
excited
and
so
going
to
have
some
fun
going
to
do
that
few
things
want
to
bring
up
few
new
subjects
so
immigration
going
to
be
doing
very
strong
number
killing
us
killing
us
and
bad
for
the
economy
bad
for
all
of
this
illegal
immigration
and
have
to
tell
you
legal
you
come
in
and
going
to
have
good
time
and
going
to
be
there
and
going
to
do
great
and
visas
maybe
work
maybe
there
are
cases
where
you
need
people
in
and
do
something
not
going
to
hurt
our
economy
in
any
way
shape
or
form
going
to
make
our
economy
much
much
stronger
but
also
going
to
get
jobs
for
people
that
are
here
people
with
us
going
to
get
jobs
going
to
get
jobs
but
the
illegal
immigration
you
know
did
this
and
made
my
determination
took
deep
breath
because
tell
you
what
it
takes
courage
to
say
going
to
run
for
president
it
really
does
especially
in
my
case
where
have
great
business
and
love
my
business
love
doing
it
may
never
even
see
it
mean
own
some
of
the
great
properties
in
the
world
in
miami
may
never
see
it
in
scotland
one
of
the
greatest
homes
of
the
british
open
and
all
of
that
may
never
see
it
again
all
of
these
incredible
places
that
have
but
more
than
that
it
takes
courage
because
when
you
do
it
putting
yourself
out
there
beyond
anything
that
done
and
it
even
takes
courage
for
politician
to
do
it
now
at
some
point
some
of
these
guys
have
to
leave
we
agree
getting
ridiculous
because
like
tomorrow
night
having
debate
and
wish
we
had
more
time
for
the
debate
not
in
terms
of
three
hours
because
who
wants
three
hours
you
know
could
stand
up
for
hours
if
had
to
but
who
wants
to
watch
that
long
debate
essentially
lasted
for
an
hour
and
half
and
was
oh
it
was
you
watch
it
you
have
against
and
honestly
not
going
to
win
just
so
you
not
going
to
win
and
neither
is
well
being
totally
protected
because
in
theory
she
even
be
allowed
to
run
being
protected
tough
game
and
nasty
game
but
being
totally
protected
but
going
to
beat
him
and
you
still
have
one
more
of
these
guys
so
be
out
quickly
guess
know
he
doing
what
do
they
do
when
they
have
zero
they
have
zero
and
say
it
against
our
folks
but
treated
me
some
of
the
have
treated
me
so
nastily
right
because
they
want
to
start
controversy
and
they
want
to
try
pick
up
some
points
and
you
know
what
not
going
to
even
mention
names
usually
do
love
doing
it
but
everybody
hit
me
so
far
has
gone
down
gone
down
and
gone
down
and
couple
of
the
ones
and
the
ones
that
hit
the
hardest
mean
like
desperate
people
but
they
hit
one
of
them
has
zero
with
an
arrow
pointing
to
the
left
that
means
less
than
zero
and
understand
what
does
it
mean
assume
but
maybe
not
but
when
you
look
at
the
things
that
are
happening
with
our
country
the
trade
situation
with
not
just
china
talk
about
china
all
the
time
because
the
main
abuser
the
biggest
abuser
the
numbers
are
astronomical
almost
billion
year
in
terms
of
imbalance
think
of
it
billion
year
and
they
send
stuff
over
here
but
we
send
stuff
over
there
they
tax
us
big
tax
friend
of
mine
get
stuff
over
there
the
tax
is
so
big
big
tax
somebody
bought
an
airplane
in
china
here
get
it
over
there
spoiled
guy
rich
guy
bought
beautiful
plane
get
it
over
there
because
the
tax
is
so
massive
that
now
selling
in
this
country
because
china
let
him
have
the
plane
and
he
has
to
pay
tax
even
tell
you
what
the
tax
is
so
astronomical
that
even
believe
them
myself
so
not
going
to
say
it
because
those
guys
will
say
well
he
was
wrong
all
can
tell
you
is
massive
tax
like
you
buy
planes
here
because
if
you
do
you
be
able
to
get
them
back
in
and
here
we
accept
all
of
their
products
so
we
have
almost
billion
trade
imbalance
with
china
we
have
billion
trade
imbalance
with
japan
we
have
you
know
with
all
going
on
in
the
south
china
sea
and
you
look
where
we
have
destroyer
relatively
small
ship
over
there
know
if
want
to
be
the
captain
of
that
ship
right
now
but
being
sort
of
mocked
and
scorned
and
lot
of
bad
things
can
happen
but
you
know
we
have
an
agreement
with
japan
and
love
japan
love
china
love
all
these
people
but
their
leaders
are
killing
us
because
smarter
sharper
more
cunning
the
leaders
of
mexico
are
killing
us
at
the
border
and
in
trade
taking
so
many
of
our
companies
even
my
taking
right
never
eating
tell
it
all
the
time
they
had
some
before
on
the
plane
and
said
want
to
touch
them
bring
them
back
yelled
out
to
bring
them
back
but
not
happy
leaving
chicago
and
moving
their
big
plant
to
mexico
so
when
you
see
this
happening
we
have
to
stop
it
and
not
going
to
beat
around
the
bush
and
oh
talk
and
be
nice
and
say
nobody
can
do
it
like
do
it
nobody
honestly
nobody
we
can
not
saying
perfect
because
not
perfect
now
perfect
but
tell
you
when
it
comes
to
that
stuff
really
nobody
better
endorsed
me
the
other
day
one
of
the
great
traders
one
of
the
great
he
says
trump
trump
and
not
somebody
that
just
do
it
he
wants
somebody
that
knows
what
doing
he
understand
you
talk
about
corporate
inversions
and
all
of
the
things
that
have
been
going
on
corporate
inversions
you
know
many
of
the
companies
in
this
country
have
trillions
of
dollars
cumulatively
they
think
trillion
overseas
right
now
they
get
it
in
and
everybody
agrees
that
we
should
bring
it
in
the
democrats
and
the
republicans
agreed
for
years
they
make
deal
because
they
have
no
leader
not
like
oh
we
disagree
on
or
we
disagree
on
something
else
although
must
tell
you
many
of
the
democrats
that
speak
to
because
friendly
with
all
of
them
friendly
with
like
republicans
get
long
with
everybody
you
know
everybody
says
oh
you
be
unifier
be
the
greatest
unifier
of
all
why
is
unifier
but
will
tell
you
many
of
the
democrats
who
voted
for
would
never
have
done
it
now
and
were
lied
to
times
right
you
can
keep
your
doctor
keep
your
plan
keep
your
this
going
to
be
great
turned
out
to
be
total
lie
different
times
that
they
know
of
and
they
have
done
it
but
when
you
look
at
happening
with
corporations
and
the
highest
tax
we
pay
the
highest
tax
anywhere
in
the
world
of
any
country
but
they
have
trillions
of
dollars
overseas
and
these
are
great
companies
in
many
cases
they
have
thousands
of
employees
they
get
their
money
back
and
the
reason
is
bureaucracy
very
hard
and
also
big
reason
the
tax
is
too
high
they
want
to
bring
million
back
and
pay
or
tax
rather
leave
it
over
there
and
if
they
bring
it
back
be
using
it
to
invest
in
our
country
mean
lot
of
good
things
will
happen
happen
to
believe
more
than
trillion
but
the
thing
and
use
it
because
so
incredible
the
thing
not
controversial
not
like
you
have
the
republicans
here
and
you
have
everybody
agrees
agreed
you
know
that
for
years
they
make
deal
and
now
happening
and
this
will
be
the
next
great
story
is
companies
are
leaving
the
united
states
two
reasons
lower
taxes
but
also
to
get
their
money
got
billions
of
dollars
overseas
leaving
our
country
in
order
to
get
their
money
and
in
order
to
pay
lower
tax
and
talking
about
one
company
know
of
know
how
much
written
about
it
but
talking
about
jobs
just
one
company
talking
about
potentially
thousands
of
companies
and
say
it
in
the
old
days
leave
new
york
people
would
move
down
and
companies
would
move
down
to
florida
or
move
to
texas
or
leave
new
jersey
where
taxes
are
quite
high
and
move
to
another
location
right
now
they
leave
our
country
and
they
go
to
other
countries
happened
in
the
world
of
the
internet
and
the
world
of
very
fast
jets
different
world
out
there
and
no
loyalty
paid
lot
of
money
to
make
lot
of
money
for
their
shareholders
and
some
of
them
are
actually
foreign
like
to
move
back
to
these
countries
they
bring
in
executives
that
are
from
ireland
from
other
places
and
they
mind
they
have
loyalty
to
the
united
states
so
my
plan
my
tax
plan
is
something
very
proud
of
going
to
solve
corporate
inversion
tell
you
what
we
will
have
that
money
back
if
get
elected
president
that
money
will
be
back
so
fast
your
head
will
spin
nobody
else
will
be
able
to
do
it
nobody
honestly
nobody
else
even
knows
about
it
the
other
candidates
most
of
them
even
know
about
it
not
their
wheelhouse
okay
not
their
thing
not
their
thing
their
thing
is
getting
what
good
at
they
get
and
they
make
promises
and
all
talk
and
no
action
and
the
same
things
happen
with
these
politicians
always
the
same
so
we
have
so
many
different
things
and
what
done
with
our
tax
plan
which
something
very
proud
of
brought
it
down
to
few
groups
because
right
now
you
have
to
go
out
people
who
doing
well
go
out
and
hire
companies
to
help
them
with
their
tax
plans
pay
because
so
complicated
and
going
to
make
it
nice
and
simple
and
getting
rid
of
carried
interest
which
is
something
that
lot
of
rich
hedge
fund
guys
love
but
getting
rid
of
it
they
love
me
so
much
anymore
but
care
and
getting
rid
of
lot
of
things
so
going
to
have
nice
simple
tax
return
somebody
said
oh
why
everybody
paying
you
know
big
percentage
will
not
pay
any
tax
at
all
people
that
are
doing
badly
they
said
well
use
the
name
because
want
to
insult
any
candidate
when
they
defend
themselves
they
said
we
want
everybody
to
pay
at
least
something
and
said
agree
the
problem
from
the
standpoint
of
bookkeeping
from
the
standpoint
of
bureaucracy
talking
about
millions
and
millions
of
returns
talking
about
building
the
even
bigger
and
monster
and
could
cut
it
down
way
down
and
the
money
that
talking
about
is
far
less
than
the
administrative
costs
so
said
agree
except
for
one
thing
from
practical
standpoint
too
much
most
of
these
people
paying
anyway
what
want
to
do
is
bring
our
jobs
back
from
china
bring
our
jobs
back
from
mexico
bring
fairness
to
our
deals
as
an
example
with
japan
was
in
ships
the
biggest
ships
ever
seen
cars
are
pouring
off
into
this
country
made
in
japan
we
give
them
practically
nothing
the
balance
is
so
bad
the
imbalance
is
so
bad
and
then
we
have
all
the
strikes
see
what
our
people
know
and
only
somebody
that
wrote
the
art
of
the
deal
or
does
this
stuff
natural
like
great
athlete
like
jack
he
was
always
able
to
sink
that
putt
right
you
know
just
better
and
you
have
athletes
very
few
but
there
are
some
people
that
have
certain
ability
lot
of
people
even
know
we
have
all
the
power
we
have
all
the
power
in
china
you
know
we
owe
right
now
china
and
japan
equally
think
of
this
trillion
trillion
think
of
this
they
take
our
business
and
in
the
case
of
japan
mostly
cars
but
they
take
our
business
they
take
our
jobs
factories
close
down
all
over
the
place
and
we
owe
them
money
right
magic
act
for
them
not
for
us
for
us
horror
show
going
to
end
going
to
end
and
people
like
and
the
people
like
the
best
negotiators
know
the
best
negotiators
in
the
world
some
think
are
horrible
people
be
honest
with
you
care
do
you
care
if
horrible
people
who
cares
now
happens
to
be
actually
very
nice
guy
but
brilliant
negotiator
and
tough
and
built
fortune
he
want
money
he
want
to
say
oh
give
me
year
in
government
money
he
wants
to
do
it
proud
to
do
it
he
wants
to
help
the
country
and
so
easy
for
him
for
instance
if
say
do
me
the
trade
deal
we
have
with
china
is
so
unfair
losing
billion
year
do
me
make
it
fair
have
to
give
him
big
have
to
give
him
big
mean
can
tell
you
that
within
very
very
short
period
of
time
things
will
straighten
out
mean
things
will
straighten
out
and
going
to
be
our
benefit
but
think
of
it
if
losing
that
kind
of
money
that
imbalance
an
imbalance
some
people
will
say
not
really
loss
it
is
loss
if
we
have
that
kind
of
imbalance
and
suppose
you
brought
it
back
to
zero
or
even
if
we
lost
billion
year
lot
of
money
believe
me
sleep
if
brought
it
to
billion
year
get
rid
of
me
in
four
years
all
right
but
suppose
we
brought
it
back
to
billion
or
we
brought
it
back
to
zero
do
you
know
what
that
means
to
this
country
do
you
know
the
kind
of
money
talking
about
then
jobs
will
start
coming
back
lots
of
good
things
would
happen
lots
of
great
things
would
happen
and
maybe
our
babies
who
have
all
these
toys
all
over
the
place
maybe
have
and
maybe
like
them
better
maybe
be
better
and
be
manufactured
here
whenever
order
television
sets
ordered
thousands
and
thousands
of
television
sets
year
for
different
jobs
and
whenever
order
them
they
all
come
from
south
korea
they
make
all
the
television
other
than
but
has
sort
of
lost
its
way
little
bit
is
japan
but
south
korea
get
bids
from
american
love
to
love
to
george
will
said
company
in
south
that
makes
television
said
where
are
they
like
to
have
good
name
too
by
the
way
important
you
know
when
paying
you
fortune
for
hotel
room
nice
to
see
good
name
right
do
we
agree
well
company
in
south
but
they
make
them
there
they
assemble
them
order
parts
that
come
in
and
assemble
them
but
much
different
but
love
it
if
we
made
them
but
you
take
south
korea
we
defend
south
korea
for
essentially
nothing
you
have
the
maniac
over
in
north
korea
that
nobody
ever
talks
about
by
the
way
now
he
really
has
nuclear
weapons
and
we
talk
about
him
we
made
the
worst
deal
ever
made
with
iran
right
the
worst
these
are
the
people
that
represent
these
people
are
incompetent
or
stupid
somebody
said
you
say
stupid
not
nice
but
true
stupid
think
mean
think
unless
know
is
there
something
going
on
that
we
know
about
think
of
it
point
after
point
we
lost
we
lost
everything
given
them
billion
hard
to
believe
they
have
to
develop
was
telling
somebody
they
have
to
develop
nuclear
weapon
they
can
buy
it
what
the
hell
why
should
they
develop
it
they
can
buy
it
and
now
all
of
sudden
going
into
syria
they
got
so
much
money
terrorist
state
going
into
all
of
these
different
places
fighting
them
in
yemen
and
yet
making
deal
with
them
so
why
you
say
hey
yemen
out
our
prisoners
want
them
back
want
them
back
want
them
over
there
want
them
back
and
all
we
have
to
do
very
simple
is
if
you
have
the
right
messenger
the
right
messenger
you
know
gotten
to
point
where
have
to
be
terrible
right
because
be
so
nice
and
say
we
can
all
do
wonderful
job
people
do
those
kind
of
stuff
for
instance
the
wall
said
guarantee
you
that
going
to
build
wall
going
to
be
real
wall
going
to
have
people
come
through
and
going
to
come
through
legally
or
going
to
come
through
with
visas
which
is
safe
way
if
we
need
it
and
we
want
people
to
come
through
want
people
to
come
through
want
to
say
no
but
we
have
at
least
million
you
know
the
scary
thing
is
nobody
has
any
idea
how
many
you
know
been
hearing
that
number
for
years
you
know
like
million
we
have
no
idea
spoke
to
one
of
the
top
people
they
have
no
idea
might
be
million
might
also
be
million
could
be
million
but
we
have
to
get
them
out
we
have
to
look
harsh
we
all
like
right
remember
the
expression
right
go
remember
he
got
elected
like
how
could
he
be
bad
all
right
and
think
he
was
nicer
general
than
and
and
like
as
president
but
love
and
love
general
love
them
and
going
to
find
ourselves
and
going
to
find
ourselves
because
we
have
lot
of
smart
guys
in
our
military
and
women
going
to
find
ourselves
going
to
find
and
going
to
find
and
really
good
at
that
going
to
find
great
people
and
told
this
story
where
watched
these
generals
go
on
television
they
be
on
television
they
be
talking
you
know
they
be
talking
they
should
be
doing
and
they
asked
certain
general
not
going
to
insult
him
it
was
like
month
and
half
ago
on
show
talk
show
said
general
so
and
so
one
of
the
top
top
top
people
said
he
doing
on
television
and
saying
well
isis
is
very
tough
you
know
they
spread
out
by
the
way
they
took
the
oil
that
said
take
remember
said
take
the
oil
always
take
the
oil
being
funded
by
the
oil
that
said
take
want
their
damned
oil
but
you
know
what
it
turned
out
to
be
another
benefit
of
having
it
take
the
oil
and
we
do
it
we
have
been
in
iraq
in
the
first
place
and
said
that
in
have
been
there
we
totally
the
middle
east
we
totally
blew
it
but
we
were
there
then
announces
because
so
predictable
we
are
leaving
on
certain
date
in
year
right
believe
was
sitting
there
thinking
did
he
really
say
that
he
said
we
will
have
all
troops
out
by
certain
date
right
did
he
say
that
said
no
no
tell
me
please
you
know
what
another
one
got
high
marks
on
from
every
poll
military
they
think
be
the
best
in
the
military
because
they
say
you
know
always
say
be
the
greatest
jobs
president
that
god
ever
created
will
but
everybody
knows
that
especially
god
everybody
knows
that
but
you
know
what
be
be
the
great
at
the
military
be
so
good
and
know
when
and
build
our
military
so
strong
so
tough
so
incredible
going
to
mess
around
never
going
to
have
to
use
it
never
going
to
have
to
use
it
and
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
believe
me
our
greatest
people
and
our
vets
are
not
being
treated
as
well
as
illegal
immigrants
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
so
go
back
so
the
world
is
unpredictable
made
business
deal
year
ago
and
the
guy
oh
beat
him
so
badly
aye
it
was
so
beautiful
it
was
beautiful
thing
it
was
like
picture
for
me
it
was
like
picture
my
own
problem
guess
but
to
me
like
painting
when
you
could
do
something
like
that
so
made
this
deal
and
it
was
great
and
they
called
they
did
story
on
me
recently
and
it
was
nice
story
and
said
hope
they
call
this
guy
they
ended
up
calling
this
guy
what
do
you
think
about
trump
and
he
said
but
in
respectful
way
he
said
he
won
because
he
was
so
damn
unpredictable
we
know
what
the
hell
he
was
going
to
do
positive
positive
mean
if
poker
player
and
predictable
not
going
home
with
much
money
okay
but
it
was
really
said
not
nice
what
he
said
first
said
not
nice
unpredictable
then
said
wait
minute
he
meant
that
as
compliment
and
called
him
said
what
did
you
mean
by
that
he
said
think
the
greatest
compliment
can
pay
we
could
not
figure
you
out
you
came
at
us
from
different
angles
so
with
when
he
announces
that
leaving
iraq
on
certain
date
we
have
been
there
but
once
you
announced
the
bad
guys
you
know
how
they
say
the
surge
worked
you
know
why
the
surge
worked
you
know
why
because
the
bad
guys
all
moved
back
they
said
hey
what
do
we
have
to
get
killed
for
mean
these
people
mind
being
killed
can
you
believe
it
but
they
said
if
we
have
to
not
so
they
moved
back
and
they
said
hey
leaving
in
what
was
the
date
do
you
remember
the
date
specific
date
to
the
day
we
will
have
all
troops
out
great
president
so
the
bad
guys
meaning
the
opponents
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
they
just
said
oh
leaving
in
year
going
to
have
all
the
troops
out
go
back
why
do
we
have
to
be
shot
at
for
the
next
year
and
what
do
we
have
to
do
because
if
we
do
well
maybe
change
his
mind
and
stay
so
let
him
think
he
has
this
great
victory
with
the
surge
right
the
surge
worked
what
happened
was
that
everybody
pulled
back
they
said
wait
now
we
leave
because
of
lack
of
leadership
we
leave
and
boom
it
comes
apart
what
happened
that
was
the
surge
everybody
talk
so
much
oh
the
surge
was
so
great
the
surge
was
great
because
everybody
knew
they
knew
what
was
happening
they
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
they
knew
we
were
leaving
even
through
bush
mean
honestly
they
knew
we
were
leaving
they
were
fed
up
so
they
pulled
back
and
they
said
get
them
out
everybody
wanted
to
leave
now
would
have
done
it
differently
even
if
wanted
to
leave
and
might
or
might
not
even
say
people
say
trump
your
attitude
on
isis
when
will
you
attack
them
where
say
you
know
want
to
talk
have
real
chance
of
winning
want
to
tell
you
what
my
attitude
want
them
to
guess
really
want
to
tell
you
mean
the
one
bad
thing
about
our
system
we
have
system
that
got
flaws
face
it
hey
look
at
our
leadership
got
flaws
but
you
know
the
one
bad
thing
when
gave
that
answer
they
say
although
some
people
see
it
here
some
people
say
we
love
that
we
love
that
but
when
give
that
answer
some
people
say
oh
trump
know
he
know
he
give
an
answer
as
to
exactly
what
going
to
do
exactly
what
going
to
do
and
know
exactly
what
going
to
do
and
eventually
after
was
asked
the
question
by
different
reporters
all
of
whom
are
here
tonight
by
the
way
said
you
know
the
problem
if
give
the
answer
not
going
to
win
because
they
write
so
incredibly
negatively
so
if
give
the
answer
not
going
to
win
going
to
say
trump
give
us
the
answer
they
know
unpredictability
they
know
strategy
and
said
for
period
of
time
like
month

to
tell
you
because

that
everybody

we
want

go
out
of
business
folks
gone
same
thing
with
china
china
is
not
even
doing
that
well
but
they
just
lowered
they
just
devalued
their
currency
the
biggest
in
two
decades
and
the
reason
they
did
it
they
could
never
thought
but
we
have
so
many
other
problems
that
they
felt
oh
wow
we
can
get
away
with
this
and
going
to
make
it
impossible
did
you
see
the
results
yesterday
of
caterpillar
tractor
horrible
because
not
getting
stuff
out
because
everybody
japan
and
china
in
particular
is
devaluing
their
currency
their
number
one
weapon
and
the
stupid
trade
deal
that
making
even
cover
it
their
number
one
weapon
and
the
trade
that
making
cover
it
so
only
say
this
and
you
know
what
people
might
say
terrible
terrible
person
terrible
human
being
but
going
to
vote
for
him
anyways
okay
fine
actually
nice
person
always
say
this
nobody
can
do
this
stuff
better
than
me
and
know
all
the
guys
running
against
wonderful
people
some
of
them
really
like
but
who
cares
was
talking
to
one
of
the
candidates
the
other
day
was
talking
about
corporate
inversions
and
they
even
know
what
the
hell
was
talking
they
had
no
idea
not
their
thing
and
unless
we
stop
all
of
the
things
that
are
going
with
other
countries
and
unless
we
make
great
trade
deals
being
eaten
alive
why
when
you
look
at
the
phony
numbers
we
have
million
people
in
our
workforce
that
working
our
real
unemployment
rate
is
probably
not
that
was
done
for
politicians
so
look
good
not
how
can
you
have
when
you
have
million
people
you
look
for
job
if
young
guy
that
handsome
young
guy
with
the
red
hair
right
if
he
comes
out
and
he
goes
into
the
workforce
and
he
looks
for
job
and
he
goes
through
college
and
does
well
and
then
he
get
job
and
when
he
gives
up
because
at
some
point
after
months
you
give
up
they
essentially
consider
you
employed
the
most
ridiculous
thing
we
have
tremendous
tens
of
millions
of
people
in
that
position
they
find
jobs
good
people
they
want
to
work
they
but
not
reflected
in
the
real
numbers
because
the
politicians
want
to
look
good
so
let
me
just
before
we
talk
some
questions
going
to
talk
about
something
never
really
talked
about
it
but
we
should
talk
about
it
called
super
one
of
the
great
scams
of
all
time
one
of
the
great
scams
so
we
sent
out
think
had
and
not
me
people
set
them
up
and
know
maybe
setting
up
for
my
benefit
take
me
guy
sees
me
likes
me
sets
up
super
talk
to
him
do
anything
think
we
had
either
or
or
we
even
know
all
over
the
place
trump
trump
one
of
them
called
the
art
of
the
deal
after
the
book
they
have
all
these
and
the
money
comes
in
and
what
do
they
do
with
the
money
know
and
we
supposed
to
call
them
or
anything
okay
so
we
wrote
letter
legal
letter
to
think
either
or
last
week
saying
we
want
their
money
send
it
back
because
again
what
do
they
do
with
it
if
some
guy
having
hard
time
all
of
sudden
has
million
sitting
in
super
do
you
think
going
to
take
for
trump
maybe
and
maybe
not
so
we
sent
them
scam
super
scam
disgrace
that
we
have
disgrace
and
tell
you
read
number
with
as
an
example
with
ben
ben
is
paying
to
almost
cents
on
the
dollar
to
raise
money
so
when
you
read
he
has
all
this
money
paying
lot
of
money
and
not
reflected
yet
so
when
you
hear
they
raised
million
paying
now
think
of
it
who
pays
the
number
actually
heard
was
but
you
know
these
guys
will
check
them
so
telling
you
it
may
be
off
but
you
all
know
lot
think
they
said
cents
on
the
dollar
think
of
it
to
raise
the
money
they
take
cents
before
they
get
to
use
the
money
for
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
somebody
is
making
fortune
know
in
campaign
couple
of
guys
walked
away
with
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
millions
they
became
rich
raising
money
better
than
being
real
estate
broker
for
the
people
and
real
estate
brokers
they
take
these
massive
percentages
of
the
money
they
raise
scam
scam
now
in
case
his
super
is
running
and
let
me
tell
you
the
people
that
are
running
that
super
even
if
it
comes
in
small
donations
those
are
the
real
bosses
those
are
the
bosses
in
the
case
of
bush
not
supposed
to
deal
with
these
super
okay
so
it
was
in
the
wall
street
journal
the
other
day
he
has
super
fundraiser
or
something
in
hotel
and
right
next
to
it
he
had
his
campaign
ballroom
did
you
read
that
two
ballrooms
one
here
one
here
right
next
to
each
other
by
coincidence
of
course
not
supposed
to
be
coordination
not
supposed
to
be
talking
right
next
to
each
other
and
nothing
compared
to
what
some
are
doing
scam
and
it
should
be
stopped
and
unfair
to
somebody
like
me
that
is
spending
my
own
money
and
what
happened
and
talked
about
this
before
but
seeing
going
on
horrible
going
on
what
happened
is
the
last
time
they
had
the
super
actually
think
there
was
sort
of
wall
you
know
they
called
it
the
wall
and
this
is
wall
too
be
as
good
as
the
one
going
to
build
but
wall
but
it
was
wall
and
they
deal
mean
even
though
like
bush
has
friend
of
his
running
his
super
sure
they
never
talk
sure
what
do
you
think
the
chances
are
that
they
talk
or
say
say
only
foolish
person
would
say
but
whatever
not
supposed
to
but
they
put
friend
in
there
they
put
other
people
in
there
they
put
whoever
and
the
way
it
works
and
in
some
cases
hear
in
case
hear
in
other
cases
literally
running
mean
had
walker
done
this
in
all
fairness
because
he
had
money
in
the
super
but
he
had
no
money
in
his
campaign
and
he
was
unable
to
figure
out
this
is
what
all
doing
why
out
of
the
race
because
he
figure
it
out
the
whole
thing
with
super
is
horrible
horrible
scam
so
sent
letters
last
week
to
as
many
as
we
could
find
all
over
the
place
we
want
you
to
close
the
super
we
want
nothing
to
do
with
it
we
want
to
get
advertisements
we
want
any
of
the
money
go
home
and
ideally
give
the
money
back
they
even
have
to
give
the
money
back
from
what
understand
they
can
keep
it
probably
if
they
actually
raised
money
for
me
say
what
horrible
thing
he
just
said
think
going
to
support
somebody
else
they
could
do
that
but
the
super
have
total
control
over
the
people
running
for
office
total
nothing
over
me
nothing
feel
very
unfair
feel
very
unfair
situation
now
if
they
want
they
could
have
full
disclosure
and
what
are
they
doing
with
this
whole
thing
and
think
it
makes
dishonest
people
out
of
people
that
might
be
honest
but
the
super
are
controlling
your
candidates
some
more
than
others
some
are
unbelievable
and
what
the
press
should
really
do
is
take
look
at
how
much
money
is
left
when
you
read
that
ben
raised
how
much
is
left
after
he
pays
all
of
the
consultants
and
all
of
these
people
how
much
is
left
to
spend
in
the
campaign
be
amazed
mean
so
little
bush
the
same
thing
and
go
over
there
are
other
names
know
every
one
of
them
but
horrible
thing
taking
place
and
again
last
cycle
at
least
they
went
through
the
motions
now
not
even
going
through
the
motions
not
even
going
through
and
just
remember
when
have
to
negotiate
with
companies
to
keep
them
in
this
country
so
they
build
jobs
here
and
they
build
their
plants
here
and
their
factories
here
and
they
do
all
of
the
things
here
when
have
to
do
that
you
know
john
paid
them
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
you
can
even
check
said
to
john
want
an
endorsement
know
if
give
me
an
endorsement
tell
you
if
they
not
so
smart
guarantee
no
other
person
gave
john
mean
bought
probably
more
than
million
worth
of
john
equipments
love
it
you
know
why
love
it
love
it
when
we
can
by
the
way
great
company
great
company
but
buy
lot
of
stuff
from
john
because
have
lot
of
big
developments
that
really
require
john
type
equipment
have
to
buy
it
from
them
could
buy
it
from
others
but
want
to
steer
it
to
them
when
can
but
we
have
to
do
something
to
clean
up
this
political
mess
because
crooked
stuff
crooked
stuff
and
got
to
stop
and
very
unfair
to
people
who
go
out
and
do
it
the
way
supposed
to
do
it
including
me
think
the
only
one
the
only
one
putting
up
my
own
money
other
than
know
precious
people
write
in
to
or
whatever
and
they
send
me
checks
like
keep
saying
the
woman
for
want
their
money
but
if
you
send
it
back
totally
insulting
mean
they
always
write
letters
too
they
write
these
beautiful
letters
trump
afford
much
and
know
you
need
it
but
sending
because
so
important
what
saying
about
the
country
beautiful
mean
seen
such
beautiful
letters
and
if
send
it
back
no
letter
can
write
not
going
to
be
insulting
to
those
people
really
dear
mr
so
and
so
or
mrs
so
and
so
need
your
money
and
thanks
lot
but
going
to
do
it
ourselves
if
got
that
back
say
who
the
hell
does
he
think
he
is
so
we
take
that
and
something
that
think
is
important
so
always
preface
it
by
saying
consider
that
funding
but
my
campaign
and
getting
ready
to
put
up
millions
millions
and
something
very
proud
of
that
think
great
and
you
know
really
great
it
gotten
very
much
publicity
gotten
much
publicity
but
have
spent
less
money
than
any
other
candidate
okay
by
far
think
know
probably
couple
of
guys
that
have
nothing
so
they
just
go
was
told
that
spend
less
and
have
the
best
results
because
in
most
polls
number
one
now
until
came
along
said
every
poll
and
then
what
the
hell
are
you
people
doing
to
me
you
know
you
know
telling
you
they
said
why
you
skip
they
told
me
that
everybody
said
skip
all
of
the
political
geniuses
man
just
interviewed
me
back
there
great
reporter
actually
great
reporter
of
course
if
he
writes
bad
story
say
that
but
he
is
great
reporter
and
he
said
would
you
ever
think
of
maybe
skipping
going
right
to
new
and
then
go
to
south
where
leading
by
massive
yeah
got
to
see
the
rallies
there
incredible
but
go
to
new
go
to
south
you
go
to
you
go
to
the
said
do
that
because
have
such
an
unbelievable
relationship
with
the
people
from
that
think
going
to
win
really
do
believe
it
believe
it
and
want
to
skip
think
going
to
do
well
think
going
to
do
great
with
evangelicals
think
lot
of
things
are
going
to
come
out
over
the
next
period
of
time
that
are
not
going
to
be
so
good
for
our
opponents
honestly
and
think
going
to
do
great
with
the
evangelicals
because
am
the
real
deal
will
tell
you
that
the
real
deal
so
told
these
political
pros
you
know
hate
to
say
it
but
the
last
long
number
of
elections
on
the
republican
circuit
the
person
that
won
did
not
get
the
nomination
okay
want
to
take
away
some
of
your
muster
you
understand
that
so
could
we
do
and
please
do
me
let
me
win
and
then
going
to
win
telling
you
going
to
win
new
and
going
to
win
south
great
poll
just
came
out
on
north
just
little
while
poll
it
was
great
some
of
you
saw
that
but
great
poll
but
going
to
go
on
and
going
to
win
going
to
win
and
actually
one
of
the
pundits
because
you
have
some
smart
pundits
and
some
very
very
dumb
pundits
lot
of
pundits
said
never
run
not
going
to
run
still
trying
to
recover
but
one
of
the
very
smart
one
says
if
trump
wins
over
interesting
because
it
will
go
right
through
because
everywhere
else
is
so
great
and
thought
it
was
good
here
come
on
okay
so
the
end
of
that
but
want
to
tell
you
will
you
refuse
to
say
get
your
asses
in
gear
will
not
say
that
will
not
say
it
will
not
say
it
because
want
to
use
anything
even
little
bit
off
so
will
you
please
do
me
and
work
with
my
people
and
go
out
on
vote
and
give
us
victory
and
if
win
going
to
run
the
whole
table
and
we
are
going
to
make
such
great
deals
and
going
to
have
such
great
military
and
going
to
take
care
of
our
health
care
without
that
crazy
nightmare
so
sticking
with
you
people
going
to
spend
money
here
have
great
team
over
here
and
will
tell
you
going
to
spend
lot
of
time
here
and
really
want
to
win
and
think
we
should
and
so
important
and
you
know
about
time
that
could
have
victory
and
let
that
person
go
onto
total
victory
okay
not
like
over
the
last
right
so
love
you
all
mean
having
fun
but
love
you
all
but
do
mean
it
going
to
stay
here
going
to
work
really
hard
when
heard
the
poll
today
they
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
said
going
to
work
harder
in
not
leaving
not
leaving
now
if
lose
will
never
speak
to
you
people
again
that
can
tell
you
okay
do
couple
of
questions
right
come
on
know
we
have
now
and
the
numbers
they
just
came
out
we
have
million
people
in
poverty
in
this
country
now
you
look
like
doing
pretty
well
in
all
fairness
but
still
we
have
million
we
have
million
people
and
getting
food
stamps
million
think
of
it
you
know
we
talk
about
how
well
doing
so
we
have
million
almost
million
each
between
poverty
food
stamps
and
got
to
end
one
of
the
problems
we
have
enough
jobs
in
this
country
very
simple
you
know
so
simple
when
you
think
about
it
our
jobs
have
been
taken
away
and
tell
you
what
else
middle
income
folks
their
salaries
gone
up
in
years
people
are
making
less
wages
now
than
they
were
years
ago
and
other
things
have
gone
up
so
really
doing
much
worse
than
they
were
doing
years
ago
but
an
amazing
but
people
one
of
the
reasons
they
say
doing
so
well
because
let
people
know
going
to
bring
jobs
back
going
to
bring
industry
and
plants
going
to
bring
it
all
back
and
nobody
else
can
say
that
going
to
bring
it
back
because
lot
of
the
folks
in
this
room
are
doing
worse
than
they
were
years
ago
and
working
then
the
other
thing
you
have
lot
of
jobs
have
some
people
that
know
very
well
and
had
job
for
years
at
the
same
place
all
of
sudden
working
because
of
because
from
an
accounting
standpoint
it
just
works
better
they
love
the
owners
the
stores
and
things
they
love
the
owners
they
think
the
owners
are
great
but
the
owners
are
forced
to
make
jobs
they
have
jobs
they
work
all
their
life
they
have
wonderful
company
that
working
for
and
now
all
of
sudden
cut
into
jobs
because
of
because
of
the
rulings
of
and
you
all
know
what
talking
about
so
they
end
up
being
workers
and
they
want
to
be
workers
they
even
like
the
psychology
of
being
called
worker
and
not
going
to
have
that
stuff
anymore
not
going
to
have
it
any
more
going
to
have
real
jobs
and
the
numbers
are
going
to
go
up
believe
me
the
numbers
are
right
now
worse
than
years
ago
and
shame
you
what
as
president
can
guarantee
it
as
trump
can
say
probably
be
able
to
pull
it
off
anyway
because
they
know
it
stop
be
easier
to
take
and
just
say
look
going
to
work
with
you
okay
so
will
you
get
me
that
number
and
everything
and
make
sure
that
everything
get
and
somebody
else
who
else
over
here
you
have
problems
with
the
also
huh
terrible
hear
only
just
hear
terrible
and
going
to
solve
that
problem
you
know
it
can
be
solved
the
waits
now
for
the
are
longer
than
ever
waits
now
are
worse
than
ever
been
thousands
of
people
dying
waiting
for
doctor
okay
dying
and
you
find
the
same
thing
you
say
you
have
to
use
your
own
because
they
do
anything
so
going
to
take
care
of
our
vets
and
going
to
take
care
of
the
and
going
to
be
one
of
the
things
going
to
be
releasing
pretty
soon
but
one
of
the
things
going
to
do
with
the
we
have
lot
of
hospitals
that
doing
any
business
we
have
lot
of
private
doctors
that
could
do
more
business
losing
lot
of
our
doctors
because
of
retiring
leaving
one
of
them
friend
of
mine
said
have
more
nurses
working
for
me
now
more
than
before
but
have
more
accountants
and
the
end
result
is
disaster
getting
out
of
the
business
got
nurses
but
got
more
accountants
than
he
has
nurses
because
the
paperwork
is
so
crazy
so
one
of
the
things
going
to
do
is
if
or
if
you
or
if
somebody
has
problems
because
of
the
wait
because
the
waits
are
unbelievable
days
sometimes
going
to
private
doctor
going
to
go
to
private
hospital
or
public
hospital
in
the
area
and
going
to
pay
for
that
and
going
to
cost
less
money
going
to
cost
less
money
than
the
system
we
have
now
and
going
to
end
up
getting
much
better
care
going
to
cost
less
and
going
to
get
better
so
the
keystone
pipeline
first
of
all
approve
it
because
thousands
of
jobs
okay
would
approve
it
so
fast
so
fast
and
should
have
approved
it
you
know
wanted
to
approve
it
but
been
dragged
so
far
left
forget
it
disaster
so
would
approve
it
but
with
that
being
said
may
want
to
make
better
deal
because
you
know
what
bringing
oil
from
canada
right
may
say
want
going
to
approve
it
but
want
because
the
truth
is
that
the
keystone
pipeline
was
better
while
ago
than
it
is
now
because
we
have
so
much
because
of
new
technology
we
have
so
much
energy
underneath
our
own
feet
with
the
and
all
of
the
other
things
that
have
emerged
over
the
last
five
years
we
have
so
much
energy
and
great
stuff
we
have
really
great
quality
higher
than
canada
you
know
they
have
the
tar
sands
which
is
problem
for
them
very
expensive
to
get
it
out
we
have
great
stuff
so
would
approve
it
because
love
the
jobs
of
building
it
love
the
jobs
of
building
it
but
may
just
say
maybe
we
should
get
maybe
as
that
oil
flows
through
our
land
you
know
maybe
we
should
do
that
so
going
to
look
into
that
but
when
approve
it
tell
you
what
when
approve
it
be
great
deal
for
the
united
states
it
be
like
because
right
now
what
doing
is
approving
it
not
really
getting
anything
putting
it
underground
and
actually
good
environmentally
better
than
having
trucks
going
down
the
road
and
everything
else
good
environmentally
but
not
getting
not
getting
anything
much
for
it
when
get
finished
with
the
keystone
be
happy
and
be
happy
okay
well
tell
you
in
all
fairness
ben
said
yesterday
or
the
other
day
that
he
wants
to
abolish
okay
and
you
know
what
disaster
that
is
now
sure
at
some
point
take
it
back
but
he
said
he
wants
to
abolish
and
one
thing
people
do
like
their
they
do
like
it
and
you
are
bringing
up
point
that
heard
before
going
to
look
at
lot
of
different
things
but
going
to
save
social
security
going
to
save
and
the
way
it
is
okay
not
abolishing
like
other
people
okay
lot
of
people
but
you
know
what
costing
us
billion
year
immigration
in
this
country
right
now
and
is
going
to
say
he
moved
million
in
the
early
moved
them
out
we
have
tremendous
illegal
immigration
problems
nice
guy
he
moved
million
people
out
of
the
united
states
and
you
know
what
happened
he
moved
them
right
across
the
border
and
they
came
back
and
they
moved
them
again
and
they
came
back
they
moved
them
third
time
they
came
right
back
and
then
you
know
they
were
tougher
in
those
days
they
moved
them
all
the
way
south
all
the
way
south
and
they
come
back
now
we
have
to
do
it
we
have
no
choice
we
either
have
country
or
we
and
want
them
to
come
back
but
want
them
to
come
back
with
papers
want
them
to
come
back
legally
want
them
to
come
back

good
ones

good
ones
but
only
the
good
ones

got
some
bad
ones

the
heat
took
with
illegal
immigration
remember
that
heat
for
two
weeks
rush
said
he
has
received
more
incoming
than
any
human
being
ever
seen
and
then
he
you
know
what
took
lot
of
heat
and
then
you
had
in
san
killed
shot
in
the
back
and
so
many
others
and
people
started
looking
and
let
me
tell
you
we
have
some
wonderful
people
over
here
and
here
illegally
but
wonderful
people
okay
and
try
to
get
them
back
real
soon
and
do
it
through
legal
process
but
we
also
have
some
really
bad
gang
members
you
know
some
of
the
gangs
in
made
up
of
illegal
immigrants
and
we
have
unbelievable
police
forces
that
get
the
respect
that
they
should
get
they
get
it
mean
what
they
go
through
unbelievable
afraid
to
talk
to
anybody
they
want
to
lose
their
jobs
they
want
to
lose
their
pensions
they
talk
now
let
me
just
tell
you
something
you
can
always
have
bad
apples
in
this
room
we
have
couple
of
bad
apples
okay
know
who
they
are
or
where
they
are
but
you
do
probably
mostly
back
there
in
the
press
but
the
police
do
an
unbelievable
job
and
they
know
the
gangs
you
go
to
the
cops
you
got
chicago
the
chicago
cops
these
people
are
amazing
people
if
they
would
be
allowed
to
do
their
jobs
but
not
allowed
to
do
their
jobs
and
going
to
get
the
bad
ones
out
of
here
so
fast
and
not
coming
back
and
want
to
put
them
in
our
jails
because
want
to
these
various
countries
where
they
come
from
for
the
next
years
want
them
in
our
jails
we
have
hundreds
of
thousands
right
now
in
our
jails
want
them
in
our
jails
heard
couple
of
these
candidates
saying
well
such
babies
but
you
know
what
talking
about
putting
them
in
jail
well
want
them
our
jails
are
want
to
use
our
jails
for
people
that
are
supposed
to
be
there
okay
and
want
to
put
these
really
bad
dudes
mean
they
are
bad
want
to
have
to
pay
for
them
for
the
next
years
okay
and
going
to
deal
very
humanely
with
the
good
people
and
they
are
mostly
good
people
but
got
some
real
bad
ones
and
out
of
here
your
head
will
spin
probably
somebody
said
the
other
day
the
first
thing
going
to
do
well
going
to
work
immediately
on
repealing
you
know
the
one
good
thing
about
executive
orders
the
one
good
thing
you
know
signed
an
executive
order
where
everybody
just
come
in
come
in
we
have
great
border
patrol
people
got
to
know
them
couple
of
months
ago
when
went
down
to
texas
to
the
border
great
people
not
allowed
to
do
their
job
they
stand
there
and
watch
people
walk
right
in
front
of
them
smiling
at
them
they
want
to
do
their
job
not
allowed
to
so
the
executive
order
that
president
signed
the
one
good
thing
about
an
executive
order
in
the
first
minute
in
office
will
and
revoke
those
executive
orders
be
revoked
the
only
good
thing
actually
the
only
good
thing
about
an
executive
order
is
that
new
president
can
just
do
signature
and
the
end
of
that
so
going
to
clean
up
our
border

they
built

the
picture

of
our
leaders
they

the
dumb

if
you

of
mexico
you

take
the
best
person
in
this
room
the
most
qualified
not

that
and
if

oh
congratulations
taking
care
of
the
baby
for
years
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
no
not
going
to
happen
by
the
way
this
is
important
sort
of
into
this
one
the
amendment
it
says
right
there
you
know
everybody
says
you
have
to
go
through
whole
process
take
many
years
you
have
to
go
through
every
state
you
have
to
do
another
amendment
wrong
amendment
covers
it
and
some
of
the
best
legal
minds
in
the
world
say
trump
is
right
said
what
am
know
into
it
every
once
in
while
you
luck
the
fact
is
somebody
comes
in
illegally
and
they
have
baby
not
responsible
now
we
may
have
court
case
but
going
to
win
it
and
simple
act
of
congress
gets
rid
of
it
and
lot
of
people
know
that
okay
and
the
reason
said
it
can
be
possible
because
nobody
could
be
foolish
enough
to
allow
thing
like
that
how
could
it
be
possible
and
one
of
the
only
countries
where
that
takes
place
and
honestly
use
mexico
as
an
example
because
so
tough
if
that
happens
in
mexico
they
even
know
what
talking
about
what
are
you
talking
about
but
with
us
no
good
not
going
to
happen
anymore
well
you
know
the
amazing
thing
is
that
the
politicians
in
this
country
live
by
whole
different
standard
when
it
comes
to
health
care
when
it
comes
to
everything
they
have
including
what
you
just
said
about
social
security
our
politicians
live
by
different
standard
and
think
that
happen
and
some
of
them
tried
to
do
it
you
know
the
story
in
they
have
to
take
it
they
live
by
different
standard
and
not
going
to
happen
going
to
live
by
the
same
standard
going
to
have
the
same
standard
as
the
poorest
person
in
this
room
the
way
going
to
be
good
question
but
do
you
know
if
answer
that
question
have
big
big
story
you
know
that
right
you
know
tell
you
it
is
question
asked
lot
know
lot
of
good
people
couple
of
people
on
the
stage
that
really
respect
gotten
to
respect
but
the
truth
is
too
early
like
to
get
things
done
first
got
to
close
the
deal
want
to
think
about
it
there
are
lot
of
good
people
there
are
lot
of
good
people
got
to
close
the
deal
got
to
get
it
done
and
to
get
it
done
want
so
good
luck
everybody
thank
you
very
much
love
you
love
you
thank
you
and
be
back
thank
you
so
going
to
be
discussing
something
so
important
for
our
country
for
our
economy
and
for
getting
us
all
working
again
and
working
well
again
tax
reform
that
think
will
make
america
strong
and
great
again
too
few
americans
are
working
too
many
jobs
are
being
shipped
overseas
and
too
many
middle
income
families
can
not
make
ends
meet
this
plan
directly
meets
these
challenges
and
the
challenges
also
of
business
it
will
provide
major
tax
relief
for
middle
income
and
for
most
other
americans
there
will
be
major
tax
reduction
it
will
simplify
the
tax
code
it
will
grow
the
american
economy
at
level
it
seen
for
decades
and
all
of
this
does
not
add
to
our
debt
or
our
deficit
but
will
also
be
discussing
some
of
that
at
the
end
because
we
have
to
make
much
better
deals
we
have
to
negotiate
much
harder
and
got
to
make
our
economy
strong
changes
for
individuals
will
be
at
levels
that
you
seen
in
long
time
going
to
cut
the
individual
rates
from
brackets
to
simplification
and
if
single
and
earn
less
than
per
year
or
married
and
jointly
earn
less
than
so
very
important
if
single
and
earn
less
than
or
married
and
jointly
earn
less
than
not
pay
any
income
tax
nothing
this
eliminates
very
strongly
and
quickly
the
marriage
penalty
very
unfair
penalty
it
eliminates
the
which
is
the
alternative
minimum
tax
it
ends
the
death
tax
double
taxation
lot
of
families
go
through
hell
over
the
death
tax
it
reduces
or
eliminates
most
of
the
deductions
and
loopholes
available
to
special
interests
or
to
the
very
rich
in
other
words
going
to
cost
me
fortune
which
is
actually
true
while
preserving
charitable
giving
and
interest
deductions
very
importantly
it
ends
the
current
tax
treatment
of
carried
interest
those
are
the
hedge
fund
folks
that
been
talking
about
for
quite
while
they
make
lot
of
money
carried
interest
so
it
ends
the
current
tax
treatment
of
carried
interest
through
speculative
partnerships
that
do
not
grow
businesses
or
create
jobs
and
are
not
risking
their
own
capital
changes
for
business
now
so
important
because
all
about
business
all
about
jobs
we
have
million
people
in
this
country
that
are
in
serious
trouble
that
want
to
work
they
work
so
for
business
no
business
of
any
size
from
fortune
company
to
mom
and
pop
shop
to
freelancer
living
from
gig
to
gig
will
pay
more
than
of
their
business
income
in
taxes
big
reduction
deemed
repatriation
of
corporate
cash
held
overseas
at
significantly
discount
which
coming
back
at
significantly
discount
so
it
comes
back
discounted
at
tax
rate
and
ends
the
deferral
of
taxes
on
corporate
income
earned
abroad
now
called
corporate
inversion
huge
subject
been
watching
politicians
now
for
years
all
talk
no
action
politicians
been
watching
them
for
years
talking
about
bringing
this
money
back
the
number
is
probably
trillion
everybody
agrees
it
should
come
back
republicans
democrats
everybody
they
make
deal
they
know
how
to
go
about
making
deal
the
reason
companies
bringing
it
back
is
the
tax
is
onerous
it
make
sense
to
bring
it
back
and
in
fact
many
companies
are
leaving
the
united
states
leaving
our
shores
to
go
and
collect
their
money
going
actually
moving
out
of
the
united
states
for
two
reasons
the
taxes
are
too
high
and
because
they
have
tremendous
amounts
of
money
that
they
bring
back
into
this
country
when
everybody
wants
them
to
bring
it
back
in
called
leadership
we
will
have
that
money
brought
back
in
as
an
example
have
millions
of
dollars
overseas
bring
it
back
into
this
country
we
filed
papers
been
doing
this
for
year
and
half
we
get
it
back
in
so
the
money
stays
in
other
countries
and
what
happens
not
good
for
us
the
level
of
leadership
that
we
need
to
get
things
like
this
done
is
so
important
but
this
is
something
and
been
watching
it
for
long
time
everybody
agrees
to
we
also
reduce
or
eliminate
some
business
loopholes
many
of
them
actually
and
deductions
made
unnecessary
or
redundant
by
the
new
lower
tax
rate
on
business
income
the
tax
rate
now
is
so
low
that
lot
of
these
deductions
which
are
complicated
which
make
sense
and
which
are
unfair
are
gone
and
we
phase
in
reasonable
cap
on
the
of
the
business
interest
expense
so
we
are
going
to
give
you
we
have
very
complex
set
of
papers
that
actually
if
you
know
business
is
not
so
complex
and
going
to
hand
them
out
right
now
to
the
press
and
think
see
we
have
an
amazing
code
it
will
be
simple
it
will
be
easy
it
will
be
fair
graduated
as
you
get
up
in
income
you
pay
little
more
some
of
the
very
unfair
deductions
that
certain
people
have
been
given
who
make
lot
of
money
will
not
be
available
any
longer
but
actually
believe
do
better
because
think
the
economy
will
grow
it
will
grow
rapidly
and
have
something
very
special
now
with
all
of
that
being
said
and
before
we
take
some
questions
we
have
to
cut
the
costs
of
going
on
in
this
country
if
you
look
at
what
doing
and
the
money
spending
read
where
washer
you
know
what
washer
is
nuts
bolts
and
washer
to
send
from
one
state
to
another
it
was
set
washer
and
it
cost
and
some
odd
dollars
to
send
it
from
here
to
there
and
there
are
many
examples
hammers
that
cost
that
you
can
buy
in
the
store
for
tiny
amount
of
money
we
will
run
this
country
properly
there
is
so
much
money
to
be
saved
reducing
taxes
but
at
the
same
time
if
win
if
become
president
we
will
be
able
to
cut
so
much
money
and
have
better
country
we
be
losing
anything
other
than
be
balancing
budgets
and
getting
them
where
they
should
be
so
this
is
plan
simple
major
reduction
think
people
are
going
to
be
very
happy
already
had
some
very
good
reviews
did
the
plan
with
some
of
the
leading
scholars
and
economists
and
tax
experts
that
there
are
in
this
country
they
love
it
they
say
why
this
been
done
before
and
this
is
my
wheelhouse
what
do
well
the
economy
is
what
do
well
whenever
they
do
polls
always
come
out
way
above
everybody
else
on
the
economy
and
on
leadership
by
the
way
but
say
that
so
if
anybody
has
applause
thank
you
amazing
some
of
the
press
was
actually
clapping
never
saw
think
ever
seen
that
before
all
right
why
we
take
some
questions
from
the
press
no
not
going
to
do
that
yet
but
we
have
their
approval
but
we
have
some
of
the
top
people
in
the
country
worked
on
this
well
looking
at
but
we
think
it
can
be
it
could
even
be
going
to
have
growth
that
will
be
tremendous
and
by
the
way
if
we
have
more
than
these
numbers
are
really
spectacular
and
one
of
the
things
that
they
take
into
account
in
any
big
league
fashion
is
the
cutting
there
is
so
much
waste
in
government
and
believe
when
get
in
there
be
able
to
cut
without
losing
anything
to
cut
tremendous
amounts
off
of
the
and
not
even
showing
anything
for
that
so
very
conservative
numbers
my
taxes
will
first
of
all
have
much
simpler
tax
statement
it
will
be
much
simpler
when
do
my
return
it
will
be
much
my
return
go
up
to
the
ceiling
and
beyond
which
is
ridiculous
and
you
spend
millions
of
dollars
at
high
level
on
lawyers
accountants
and
everything
else
we
want
to
simplify
them
to
tremendous
level
the
bracket
of
the
big
difference
is
many
of
the
loopholes
and
many
of
the
deductions
which
are
all
been
there
for
years
are
antiquated
in
many
cases
or
are
put
there
because
lot
of
the
people
that
get
these
deductions
are
contributed
to
contributing
to
bush
contributing
to
every
candidate
but
trump
because
not
taking
any
money
and
these
people
want
these
deductions
there
will
be
people
reducing
taxes
but
believe
me
there
will
be
people
in
the
very
upper
that
be
thrilled
with
this
taking
away
deductions
and
one
of
the
reasons
able
to
lower
it
this
is
actually
tax
reduction
big
tax
reduction
including
for
the
upper
income
believe
that
the
economy
will
do
so
well
that
even
though
they
be
getting
certain
deductions
which
fair
for
them
to
be
getting
that
end
up
doing
better
just
think
this
is
common
sense
approach
you
know
we
could
say
supply
side
you
could
say
different
names
given
out
for
different
kinds
of
deductions
or
increases
think
supply
side
or
anything
else
think
this
is
common
sense
well
thought
out
tax
proposal
going
to
trigger
the
economy
going
to
make
everybody
go
back
and
really
want
to
work
going
to
create
tremendous
numbers
of
jobs
one
of
the
other
things
that
coupling
this
with
is
if
become
president
going
to
renegotiate
our
trade
deals
because
our
trade
deals
are
not
sustainable
by
this
country
not
sustainable
we
can
not
continue
to
let
our
jobs
go
to
all
of
the
different
countries
not
country
that
we
negotiate
with
that
make
better
deal
everybody
we
lose
money
with
everything
also
going
to
renegotiate
some
of
our
military
costs
because
we
protect
south
korea
we
protect
germany
we
protect
some
of
the
wealthiest
countries
in
the
world
saudi
arabia
we
protect
everybody
we
protect
everybody
and
we
get
reimbursement
we
lose
on
everything
we
lose
on
everything
so
going
to
negotiate
and
renegotiate
trade
deals
military
deals
many
other
deals
going
to
get
the
costs
down
for
running
our
country
very
significantly
not
showing
big
number
in
that
but
believe
that
if
become
president
those
numbers
are
going
to
be
massive
as
an
example
saudi
arabia
they
make
billion
day
we
protect
them
so
we
need
help
losing
tremendous
amount
of
money
on
yearly
basis
and
we
owe
trillion
used
to
say
trillion
for
the
last
months
now
trillion
and
only
going
up
well
no
look
senator
is
lightweight
we
understand
that
he
be
able
to
do
this
he
know
trade
deal
from
any
other
deal
and
what
certain
people
are
trying
to
do
is
trying
to
take
we
just
went
up
in
the
last
poll
we
went
up
two
points
in
the
last
poll
and
we
continue
to
go
up
in
the
poll
think
we
went
from
to
going
up
very
strongly
in
the
polls
they
know
what
to
do
about
it
built
great
company
see
that
in
minutes
last
night
built
great
company
phenomenal
company
with
very
little
debt
tremendous
cash
flow
funding
my
own
campaign
guys
like
mean
he
desperately
needs
money
ask
the
car
dealer
in
florida
ask
the
people
that
support
him
and
guy
like
and
others
want
to
single
him
out
him
out
but
largely
controlled
by
their
donors
the
special
interests
and
frankly
more
than
anybody
else
the
lobbyists
turned
down
millions
of
millions
of
dollars
from
lobbyists
and
special
interests
because
not
the
right
thing
just
not
right
and
that
seems
to
be
resonating
very
strongly
negotiate
true
get
bills
from
people
negotiate
oh
is
that
bad
thing
the
country
should
do
that
yeah
would
bring
that
same
attitude
to
the
white
house
true
she
says
have
habit
when
you
get
bill
call
up
and
you
negotiate
to
me
compliment
no
want
to
take
that
thinking
to
the
white
house
would
bet
you
we
could
save
of
our
budget
could
even
save
more
but
we
could
save
tremendous
amount
that
has
to
be
the
attitude
our
country
has
you
spend
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
on
doing
something
that
you
can
do
for
you
know
when
you
look
at
costs
we
just
spent
million
building
soccer
field
okay
soccer
field
for
our
prisoners
that
happen
to
be
in
okay
like
that
what
do
you
need
million
for
level
out
the
surface
let
them
play
if
they
had
to
play
at
all
okay
what
do
you
need
to
spend
million
we
just
spent
story
today
million
on
soccer
field
how
do
you
spend
million
doing
soccer
field
you
have
level
piece
of
land
throw
them
ball
if
they
have
to
play
soccer
if
they
have
to
play
at
all
why
are
they
playing
soccer
is
my
question
no
too
long
you
have
time
you
have
time
no
not
at
all
lowering
taxes
which
republicans
love
and
think
one
of
the
reasons
am
doing
so
well
in
the
polls
and
one
of
the
reasons
doing
so
well
when
it
comes
to
the
economy
in
all
polls
is
that
this
is
the
thinking
no
lowering
taxes
very
substantially
simplifying
and
getting
rid
of
deductions
that
are
actually
that
certain
people
want
to
keep
for
certain
reasons
so
no
not
true
well
was
interviewed
and
was
interviewed
last
night
thought
his
interview
though
charlie
rose
did
an
excellent
job
but
thought
his
was
softer
interview
interviewed
me
thought
was
terrific
mean
it
was
tough
interview
but
thought
he
was
very
fair
and
thought
the
piece
was
very
good
why
is
he
harder
on
me
than
would
say
because
is
nicer
person
than
am
the
worst
in
years
well
good
question
and
you
can
connect
the
dots
but
guess
it
has
been
probably
since
you
know
talking
about
years
that
people
have
wanted
to
bring
the
money
back
into
the
country
and
again
called
corporate
inversion
and
in
lot
of
time
corporations
are
moving
out
and
going
to
other
countries
taking
jobs
and
now
we
have
really
big
problem
because
we
have
serious
companies
very
large
very
prestigious
companies
as
you
know
obviously
you
know
something
about
business
but
we
have
major
companies
looking
to
move
out
of
the
united
states
you
know
it
used
to
be
move
from
new
york
to
florida
move
from
new
jersey
to
texas
or
whatever
now
talking
about
moving
from
the
united
states
to
ireland
and
to
england
and
to
other
places
to
spain
where
they
get
treated
differently
and
frankly
better
and
doing
that
for
number
of
reasons
but
one
of
the
reasons
one
of
the
big
reasons
as
you
know
is
taxes
one
of
the
other
reasons
is
to
get
all
of
this
cash
that
built
up
and
they
get
back
into
our
country
and
when
this
money
comes
back
into
our
country
that
everybody
wants
going
to
be
put
to
work
in
our
country
largely
it
can
go
other
places
but
largely
and
think
it
will
be
an
amazing
boon
now
the
other
thing
they
think
trillion
think
much
more
than
that
actually
think
going
to
be
more
money
than
that
and
boy
if
it
is
we
have
hit
pay
dirt
well
you
know
when
you
end
the
repatriation
when
you
get
the
money
coming
back
in
beyond
tremendous
things
happen
well
be
announcing
that
in
the
not
too
distant
future
but
will
tell
you
been
honest
the
only
one
honest
about
this
thing
watched
watched
all
oh
pay
so
much
tax
pay
so
much
tax
watched
all
politicians
and
they
say
pay
fight
like
hell
to
pay
as
little
as
possible
can
say
that
not
politician
fight
like
hell
always
because
an
expense
and
you
know
feel
fight
have
the
best
lawyers
and
the
best
accountants
and
fight
and
pay
but
an
expense
and
frankly
would
feel
differently
if
this
country
was
spending
the
money
wisely
instead
of
throwing
it
out
the
drain
our
country
spends
our
money
so
stupidly
and
will
tell
you
that
could
speak
for
myself
pay
lot
of
tax
but
fight
like
hell
to
make
it
as
low
as
possible
but
would
feel
lot
differently
if
our
leadership
was
such
that
respected
the
decisions
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
list
of
the
things
that
our
government
is
spending
money
on
right
now
and
you
feel
so
good
about
our
country
tell
you
what
in
terms
of
income
inequality
going
to
create
lot
of
jobs
you
know
right
now
we
have
false
every
month
different
such
phony
number
because
when
people
look
and
look
and
look
and
then
they
give
up
looking
for
job
taken
off
the
roll
so
the
number
reflective
seen
numbers
of
actually
saw
number
of
unemployment
and
it
could
be
because
when
looking
for
job
and
you
go
around
and
you
look
and
you
look
and
you
find
it
you
want
to
work
and
you
want
to
take
care
of
your
family
and
then
you
get
the
job
you
know
what
talking
about
because
shaking
your
head
and
you
get
the
job
essentially
for
statistically
purposes
you
are
considered
employed
so
then
read
every
time
it
comes
out
hear
unemployment
that
is
the
biggest
joke
there
is
in
this
country
that
number
is
so
false
and
you
know
people
ask
how
come
trump
is
doing
so
well
and
and
others
how
come
doing
you
know
why
doing
well
because
people
are
tired
of
political
speak
tired
of
that
and
the
worst
example
of
it
one
of
the
worst
example
of
it
is
the
phony
unemployment
rate
the
unemployment
rate
is
probably
but
will
tell
you
you
have
some
great
economists
that
will
tell
you
and
the
highest
heard
so
far
is
anger
out
there
at
the
job
picture
now
one
of
the
things
with
that
being
said
china
japan
mexico
brazil
these
countries
are
all
taking
our
jobs
like
bunch
of
babies
that
will
stop
people
will
treat
us
fairly
if
become
president
losing
our
jobs
losing
our
base
losing
our
manufacturing
all
of
that
will
stop
well
this
is
number
one
simplification
number
two
what
really
doing
is
the
big
picture
because
corporations
now
are
going
to
start
having
an
incentive
to
create
jobs
going
to
have
an
incentive
also
to
stay
in
this
country
if
they
provide
bigger
dividends
people
are
going
to
have
more
money
to
spend
so
not
so
bad
either
if
corporation
gives
out
bigger
dividend
great
gets
bigger
dividend
going
to
have
more
money
to
spend
in
the
economy
so
good
know
nothing
about
that
no
not
populist
no
not
man
of
great
common
sense
man
built
tremendous
company
with
the
best
locations
in
real
estate
the
best
everything
here
at
one
of
them
have
many
of
these
done
great
job
employed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
employ
now
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
done
good
job
but
say
populist
at
all
would
say
man
of
common
sense
cutting
taxes
going
to
create
lot
of
jobs
going
to
get
rid
of
tremendous
amount
of
waste
and
tell
you
what
the
waste
that
get
rid
of
the
waste
that
get
rid
of
is
going
to
have
huge
impact
and
not
even
putting
that
in
my
numbers
so
think
going
to
be
terrific
yes
the
motor
industry
beautiful
way
of
describing
it
the
motor
industry
where
are
you
from
england
love
them
oh
what
beautiful
accent
no
want
to
get
the
industry
we
call
it
the
automobile
industry
but
want
to
get
the
automobile
industry
to
build
factories
here
as
you
know
ford
is
building
billion
factory
in
mexico
mexico
also
took
big
plant
out
of
and
thought
they
were
going
to
get
it
and
they
want
the
motor
companies
as
you
would
say
or
the
automobile
companies
to
build
their
plants
in
the
united
states
want
leaving
for
mexico
or
any
place
else
want
these
companies
not
to
leave
chicago
not
to
leave
michigan
not
to
leave
new
and
and
south
and
all
of
these
places
where
leaving
and
going
to
other
countries
want
them
to
stay
here
and
they
will
stay
here
and
be
so
happy
ladies
and
gentlemen
thank
you
very
much
been
great
thank
you
autism
has
become
an
epidemic
years
ago
years
ago
you
look
at
the
statistics
not
even
close
it
has
gotten
totally
out
of
control
am
totally
in
of
vaccines
but
want
smaller
doses
over
longer
period
of
time
because
you
take
baby
in
and
seen
it
and
seen
it
and
had
my
children
taken
care
of
over
long
period
of
time
over
two
or
three
year
period
of
time
same
exact
amount
but
you
take
this
little
beautiful
baby
and
you
pump
mean
it
looks
just
like
meant
for
horse
not
for
child
and
had
so
many
instances
people
that
work
for
me
just
the
other
day
two
years
old
two
and
half
years
old
child
beautiful
child
went
to
have
the
vaccine
and
came
back
and
week
later
got
tremendous
fever
got
very
very
sick
now
is
autistic
only
say
in
of
vaccines
do
them
over
longer
period
of
time
same
amount
but
just
in
little
sections
and
think
going
to
have
think
going
to
see
big
impact
on
autism
oh
boy
expect
that
you
know
and
the
group
veterans
for
strong
america
called
and
they
said
would
you
come
over
and
speak
here
for
certain
reason
you
know
called
tomorrow
night
so
got
here
and
they
asked
couple
of
days
ago
if
it
would
possible
to
come
over
and
say
few
words
an
endorsement
from
your
group
with
so
many
veterans
hundreds
of
thousands
of
veterans
really
appreciate
that
did
not
expect
that
expect
it
ask
for
it
will
say
this
am
with
the
veterans
our
greatest
people
being
treated
terribly
not
only
the
number
of
deaths
which
are
obviously
going
on
is
incredible
but
as
of
two
weeks
ago
on
the
vets
had
the
longest
wait
in
the
history
of
the
veterans
administration
you
go
in
to
see
doctor
you
wait
for
days
for
days
and
not
going
to
happen
not
going
to
happen
if
win
believe
me
not
going
to
happen
and
one
of
the
things
thought
do
and
stress
so
strongly
the
veterans
hospitals
obviously
they
have
problems
not
properly
run
and
when
you
have
to
wait
long
hours
and
long
days
and
then
in
some
cases
have
the
doctor
say
sorry
going
on
vacation
believe
me
it
get
much
worse
than
that
so
going
to
create
whole
new
system
going
to
take
this
system
apart
and
if
not
doing
the
job
the
veterans
are
going
to
go
to
private
doctors
private
hospitals
public
hospitals
and
going
to
reimburse
those
doctors
and
those
hospitals
and
going
to
get
the
greatest
service
of
any
veterans
in
any
country
because
you
deserve
it
and
going
to
be
broken
down
into
something
going
to
be
very
special
right
now
and
you
know
it
we
have
illegal
immigrants
that
are
treated
better
by
far
than
our
veterans
not
going
to
happen
anymore
not
going
to
happen
so
just
really
appreciate
it
so
unexpected
to
be
here
is
an
they
build
ships
like
this
anymore
folks
you
know
we
do
them
this
way
anymore
actually
said
what
about
recommissioning
look
at
this
thing
the
largest
guns
in
the
world
the
most
powerful
guns
learned
about
the
by
the
way
is
great
place
for
lot
of
reasons
you
know
we
have
been
treated
so
well
in
the
state
of
been
incredible
number
one
on
the
polls
and
we
love
those
people
great
so
this
is
great
ship
and
great
state
just
want
to
say
that
going
to
come
out
with
some
plans
in
very
short
time
going
to
be
building
up
our
military
going
to
make
our
military
so
big
and
so
strong
and
so
great
and
it
will
be
so
powerful
that
think
going
to
ever
have
to
use
it
going
to
mess
with
us
that
can
tell
you
and
going
to
have
president
respected
by
respected
by
iran
you
know
talk
about
for
two
seconds
talk
about
the
iran
deal
now
and
his
people
call
him
the
supreme
leader
of
iran
talks
about
the
supreme
leader
well
not
calling
him
supreme
leader
but
he
said
the
other
day
that
after
this
deal
is
completed
he
will
never
touch
do
business
with
the
united
states
again
finished
with
the
united
states
taking
billion
getting
deal
going
to
go
right
into
nuclear
weapons
much
sooner
than
you
think
going
to
think
about
that
one
they
are
going
to
go
and
got
the
they
have
provisions
and
by
the
way
what
people
understand
the
provision
start
you
know
this
right
it
start
for
long
time
before
you
even
get
to
it
the
clock
is
ticking
it
can
take
forever
we
may
never
get
it
there
it
is
one
of
the
dumbest
deals
and
one
of
the
weakest
contracts
ever
seen
of
any
kind
so
we
are
going
to
do
things
and
this
country
right
not
going
to
sign
deals
where
we
have
four
prisoners
over
there
and
still
there
and
we
even
ask
for
them
one
of
them
is
there
because
christian
we
have
writer
we
have
the
whole
thing
is
absolutely
insane
you
know
they
asked
the
president
and
they
asked
secretary
of
state
who
maybe
you
know
been
saying
is
the
worst
secretary
of
state
in
the
history
of
this
country
right
all
right
been
saying
it
but
possible
the
world
blew
up
around
her
it
blew
up
just
blew
up
the
whole
world
is
like
different
place
possible
that
because
of
this
deal
made
by
secretary
who
has
absolutely
no
clue
how
to
negotiate
it
may
that
going
to
supersede
and
understand
that
he
may
want
to
run
for
president
he
has
no
chance
like
she
has
no
chance
so
going
to
see
what
happens
we
have
many
problems
in
our
country
one
of
them
is
immigration
now
took
tremendous
hit
when
brought
up
illegal
immigration
when
announced
was
running
for
president
and
for
two
weeks
said
you
know
rush
great
guy
he
said
he
has
suffered
more
incoming
meaning
the
press
than
anybody
seen
so
what
happened
is
you
have
now
found
out
what
illegal
immigration
is
all
about
and
am
so
happy
that
the
one
that
brought
it
to
the
fore
because
believe
me
big
problem
it
is
big
problem
so
you
remember
for
about
two
weeks
said
boy
this
is
tougher
than
thought
running
for
president
and
then
you
found
out
tremendous
crime
tremendous
drugs
pouring
across
the
border
tremendous
beyond
going
to
chicago
going
to
new
york
going
to
going
all
over
our
country
so
the
drugs
pour
in
and
the
money
pours
out
not
good
deal
we
get
the
drugs
they
get
the
money
the
drug
cartels
are
going
wild
they
can
not
believe
how
stupid
our
government
is
they
are
making
fortune
the
drugs
come
in
the
money
goes
out
daily
and
saw
it
because
was
on
the
border
was
there
and
we
saw
it
and
everybody
sees
it
everyday
and
we
have
the
kind
of
people
that
can
do
something
about
it
but
we
have
no
leadership
none
none
whatsoever
so
going
to
build
wall
and
going
to
pay
for
the
wall
believe
me
you
know
lot
of
politicians
have
said
oh
not
going
to
pay
they
know
anything
about
they
never
read
the
art
of
the
deal
first
of
all
so
the
story
so
the
story
said
the
other
day
to
one
of
my
people
what
is
the
united
trade
deficit
with
mexico
japan
and
china
so
start
with
china
almost
billion
year
now
if
you
have
company
where
losing
billion
got
to
do
something
very
fast
we
been
losing
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
year
frankly
for
decades
not
going
to
happen
anymore
not
going
to
happen
anymore
with
japan
where
their
massive
ships
floating
right
here
and
they
drop
off
the
cars
right
they
drop
off
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
cars
millions
of
cars
and
we
sell
them
beef
we
sell
them
beef
and
they
want
it
because
their
farmers
want
our
beef
they
protest
and
they
send
it
back
all
right
not
going
to
happen
that
way
anymore
now
with
mexico
and
love
mexico
have
many
many
people
many
many
people
from
mexico
that
work
with
me
and
they
work
for
me
and
they
buy
my
apartments
same
with
china
have
so
many
people
they
pay
me
millions
and
millions
what
am
supposed
to
hate
china
because
they
gave
me
millions
of
dollars
to
buy
an
apartment
think
so
had
the
largest
bank
in
the
world
as
tenant
from
china
bigger
than
any
bank
in
this
country
by
many
times
from
china
the
problem
that
we
have
is
that
the
leaders
of
mexico
japan
and
china
and
every
other
country
that
we
do
business
with
smarter
more
cunning
sharper
than
our
leaders
love
free
trade
the
concept
is
great
but
you
need
smart
people
have
the
smartest
people
in
this
country
lined
up
know
the
smartest
have
have
the
best
business
leaders
and
they
all
want
to
do
it
wealthy
because
they
make
good
deals
like
me
make
good
deals
you
know
talent
talent
you
be
politician
look
fighting
some
very
nice
people
very
nice
even
though
leading
in
the
polls
but
very
nice
people
but
never
going
to
do
anything
with
these
countries
never
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
an
instinct
something
special
they
have
it
believe
me
they
have
it
just
going
to
be
more
of
the
same
so
we
are
going
to
make
our
country
so
great
we
are
going
to
make
it
strong
we
are
going
to
make
it
powerful
going
to
rebuild
the
military
going
to
make
it
so
strong
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
veterans
and
in
the
end
in
the
end
want
you
people
to
look
around
and
look
at
each
other
because
this
is
going
to
be
special
day
the
other
week
two
weeks
ago
in
mobile
alabama
people
showed
up
in
rainy
rough
day
people
came
to
see
us
speak
and
talking
about
making
america
great
again
last
night
in
dallas
at
the
american
airlines
people
the
basketball
arena
of
the
mavericks
people
showed
up
and
want
to
tell
you
it
was
love
fest
everybody
think
of
it
people
there
one
heckler
in
the
whole
room
kept
saying
got
to
be
one
there
was
word
two
words
that
used
to
be
used
lot
called
silent
majority
they
stopped
using
them
the
silent
majority
believe
me
is
back
and
think
we
can
use
it
somewhat
different
think
we
have
to
call
it
silent
majority
anymore
because
not
silent
people
are
not
silent
disgusted
with
our
incompetent
politicians
disgusted
with
the
people
that
are
giving
our
country
away
disgusted
when
they
tell
the
border
patrol
agents
who
are
good
people
and
can
do
the
job
disgusted
when
allowed
people
to
just
walk
right
in
front
of
them
and
standing
there
helpless
and
people
just
pour
into
the
country
disgusted
when
woman
nine
months
pregnant
walks
across
the
border
has
baby
and
you
have
to
take
care
of
that
baby
for
the
next
years
disgusted
by
happening
to
our
country
and
going
to
look
around
and
going
to
remember
who
the
people
are
that
are
here
because
doing
something
special
this
is
movement
going
to
make
our
country
great
again
believe
me
we
will
make
our
country
great
again
love
you
all
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
all
for
being
here
this
is
some
turnout
my
great
the
chairman
just
left
as
you
probably
know
and
been
extremely
fair
the
has
been
absolutely
terrific
over
the
last
two
month
period
and
as
you
know
what
wanted
wanted
fairness
have
to
be
treated
any
differently
than
anybody
else
just
wanted
fairness
from
the
republican
party
leading
in
every
single
poll
new
poll
came
out
today
where
over
actually
hit
numbers
as
high
as
and
and
frankly
felt
that
the
absolute
best
way
to
win
and
to
beat
the
democrats
and
very
easily
think
beat
the
democrats
no
matter
who
it
may
be
whether
or
anybody
else
and
think
maybe
is
going
to
have
very
hard
time
frankly
with
happening
getting
to
the
starting
gate
the
best
way
for
the
republicans
to
win
is
if
win
the
nomination
and
go
directly
against
whoever
they
happen
to
put
up
and
for
that
reason
have
signed
the
pledge
so
will
be
totally
pledging
my
allegiance
to
the
republican
party
and
the
conservative
principles
for
which
it
stands
and
we
will
go
out
and
we
will
fight
hard
and
we
will
win
we
will
win
and
most
importantly
we
will
make
our
country
great
again
because
what
all
about
we
have
to
make
our
country
great
again
this
is
campaign
we
have
our
heart
in
it
we
have
our
soul
in
it
need
money
and
want
money
and
this
is
going
to
be
campaign
like
think
no
other
not
controlled
by
lobbyists
not
controlled
by
anybody
controlled
by
the
people
of
the
country
in
order
to
make
our
country
great
again
yeah
got
nothing
really
got
nothing
the
question
was
what
did
get
for
signing
the
pledge
absolutely
nothing
other
than
the
assurance
that
would
be
treated
fairly
and
seen
that
over
the
last
two
months
they
really
have
been
very
fair
no
have
no
intention
of
changing
my
mind
well
think
the
big
thing
changed
is
and
been
obvious
to
all
number
one
after
announced
we
went
up
like
rocket
ship
nobody
thought
was
going
to
run
and
they
said
oh
he
run
and
he
put
in
his
papers
and
he
do
all
of
this
did
that
the
papers
in
terms
of
the
company
turned
out
to
be
spectacular
great
company
built
great
company
and
all
of
the
other
papers
have
turned
out
to
be
very
well
received
and
think
the
thing
changed
is
the
fact
that
went
to
number
one
place
very
quickly
after
signed
and
after
in
this
building
notified
everybody
that
be
running
for
president
so
think
the
biggest
thing
is
that
went
early
to
number
one
and
the
has
treated
me
with
great
respect
so
that
was
very
important
no
see
no
circumstances
under
which
would
tear
up
that
pledge
well
you
have
to
be
met
when
at
one
of
those
things
the
way
life
works
and
like
by
the
way
well
the
chairman
asked
if
he
could
come
up
you
saw
him
he
was
here
little
while
ago
and
was
greatly
that
he
did
come
up
frankly
well
think
that
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
nation
that
speaks
english
and
think
that
while
in
this
nation
we
should
be
speaking
english
and
how
assimilation
takes
and
how
mean
whether
people
like
it
or
not
how
we
assimilate
and
how
we
go
on
to
that
next
phase
and
that
next
stage
and
how
people
that
speak
and
not
just
talking
about
spanish
talking
about
from
various
parts
of
the
world
how
they
will
become
successful
and
do
great
so
think
more
appropriate
to
be
speaking
english
well
one
of
the
things
want
to
do
and
feel
very
strongly
country
based
on
borders
and
our
country
is
based
on
laws
and
when
people
come
into
the
country
illegally
we
should
not
allow
that
and
this
is
not
from
south
america
this
is
not
from
mexico
this
is
from
all
over
the
world
when
people
come
illegally
we
can
not
allow
that
and
want
people
to
come
legally
want
very
much
to
take
care
of
our
border
because
our
southern
border
is
total
mess
been
proven
and
interestingly
couple
of
months
ago
when
announced
made
some
very
strong
statements
about
the
crime
and
the
problems
that
were
happening
and
been
proven
right
and
many
of
the
people
in
this
audience
actually
have
to
me
which
very
much
appreciate
of
course
they
done
it
publicly
but
these
are
minor
details
but
someday
they
will
the
fact
is
that
we
are
nation
that
wants
and
needs
borders
nation
that
wants
and
needs
and
is
based
on
laws
and
we
will
make
sure
that
that
takes
place
with
that
being
said
want
people
to
come
into
our
country
legally
want
to
have
big
fat
beautiful
open
door
want
people
of
great
talent
to
come
in
for
silicon
valley
want
engineers
want
physicists
want
people
with
great
talent
to
come
into
the
united
states
when
people
graduate
from
college
you
can
be
number
one
in
your
class
at
harvard
or
number
one
at
yale
or
the
school
of
finance
or
or
and
immediately
if
not
citizen
of
the
united
states
you
get
thrown
out
of
the
country
we
want
those
people
to
stay
we
want
people
of
great
talent
to
be
in
the
united
states
to
work
here
and
ultimately
to
become
citizen
know
enough
about
it
to
comment
on
it
was
she
jailed
really
know
much
about
it
absolutely
false
win
at
golf
win
at
golf
that
can
tell
you
well
understand
how
the
system
works
maybe
better
than
anybody
understand
the
political
system
and
understand
also
very
much
system
for
coming
in
for
illegal
immigrants
forget
if
bring
up
the
subject
of
illegal
immigration
you
be
asking
the
question
nobody
would
be
even
talking
about
immigration
and
immigration
and
in
particular
illegal
immigration
has
become
very
big
factor
now
lot
of
bad
things
have
happened
with
respect
to
crime
since
brought
it
up
but
if
bring
it
up
immigration
would
not
even
be
subject
that
talking
about
and
it
happens
to
be
very
important
subject
have
to
say
this
it
can
also
be
very
positive
subject
because
believe
so
strongly
in
immigration
and
just
we
have
to
stop
illegal
immigration
and
we
have
to
look
forward
to
great
immigration
done
in
legal
manner
but
if
bring
it
up
nobody
would
be
talking
about
it
well
there
is
gridlock
in
congress
right
now
and
because
no
leadership
at
the
top
you
have
to
be
able
to
lead
you
have
to
be
able
to
get
people
into
your
office
you
have
to
get
people
go
to
them
any
way
you
want
to
do
it
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
lead
there
is
no
leadership
at
the
top
signing
executive
orders
it
not
the
way
our
country
was
supposed
to
be
run
want
to
talk
about
that
inappropriate
well
is
very
good
friend
of
mine
great
guy
for
those
of
you
who
know
him
very
and
an
honest
guy
and
truly
great
athlete
he
is
really
very
good
friend
of
mine
and
just
spoke
to
him
little
while
ago
so
thrilled
and
so
happy
think
what
done
is
terrible
and
been
exonerated
as
understand
it
because
just
heard
about
it
but
very
happy
for
as
far
as
the
commissioner
is
concerned
having
rough
year
face
it
having
very
rough
year
well
in
europe
they
have
tremendous
problems
with
people
going
in
and
storming
and
huge
humanitarian
problem
and
just
say
this
this
united
states
has
tremendous
problems
of
their
own
we
have
infrastructure
that
we
have
to
fix
we
have
bridges
and
roads
and
tunnels
and
everything
is
falling
apart
our
in
such
trouble
why
being
builder
and
great
builder
and
very
successful
builder
think
will
greatly
help
but
we
have
so
many
of
our
own
problems
including
the
border
including
the
wall
which
we
will
get
built
including
all
of
the
things
we
have
health
care
which
is
mess
you
know
if
you
look
at
the
premiums
have
gone
up
people
are
saying
this
is
turning
out
to
be
disaster
are
through
the
roof
the
on
through
the
roof
so
we
have
lot
of
problems
we
have
to
take
care
of
our
vets
we
have
to
build
up
our
military
just
the
other
day
ray
said
that
the
army
is
in
the
worst
shape
in
its
history
in
terms
of
preparedness
now
for
them
to
be
in
bad
shape
with
the
way
we
are
and
with
the
world
hating
us
and
you
look
at
and
said
the
worst
secretary
of
state
in
the
history
of
this
country
now
in
all
fairness
because
of
the
agreement
about
to
be
with
iran
john
may
very
well
take
her
place
think
that
agreement
is
disaster
for
this
country
for
israel
for
the
middle
east
going
to
lead
to
nuclear
proliferation
the
clause
everything
about
it
we
even
get
our
prisoners
back
you
say
who
negotiates
thing
like
that
that
happen
can
guarantee
you
with
president
trump
see
it
later
yeah
they
want
to
hear
it
would
say
very
simply
just
want
to
be
treated
like
everybody
else
you
see
was
always
the
fair
hair
boy
was
big
contributor
nobody
knows
the
system
but
was
on
the
other
side
and
was
the
elite
was
the
fair
hair
person
once
ran
all
of
sudden
was
little
bit
of
an
outsider
became
an
outsider
because
was
running
because
supposed
to
run
this
businessman
that
people
have
given
me
great
credit
as
being
great
businessman
but
not
supposed
to
be
running
for
office
the
fact
is
that
our
country
is
being
killed
on
trade
by
china
by
japan
by
mexico
both
at
the
border
and
on
trade
and
not
knocking
those
countries
their
leaders
are
much
much
smarter
than
our
leaders
they
are
absolutely
killing
us
china
taking
our
jobs
taking
our
money
taking
our
base
and
think
of
this
we
owe
china
trillion
and
paying
them
interest
we
owe
japan
with
all
of
the
cars
coming
in
the
same
amount
trillion
now
like
magic
act
they
send
the
cars
in
they
take
our
jobs
they
do
everything
and
we
owe
them
money
not
going
to
happen
with
me
bush
is
very
nice
man
be
honest
think
very
nice
person
think
very
low
energy
person
and
think
what
the
country
needs
hear
going
to
spend
lot
of
money
on
negative
on
me
and
honestly
look
getting
the
money
from
special
interests
getting
the
money
from
lobbyists
and
his
donors
and
making
him
do
it
because
crashing
in
the
polls
so
know
going
to
happen
if
he
spends
million
or
million
on
negative
know
know
that
my
life
will
continue
just
know
mean
ever
spent
money
on
against
me
but
he
probably
has
to
do
that
although
it
would
not
be
the
way
done
you
know
one
of
the
things
most
about
is
that
so
far
everybody
attacked
me
has
gone
down
the
tubes
you
have
graham
attacked
me
he
was
at
now
at
zero
you
have
perry
attacked
me
now
getting
out
of
the
race
he
was
at
or
now
getting
out
of
the
race
he
was
at
zero
everybody
rand
paul
attacked
me
see
the
last
poll
the
poll
that
just
came
out
today
where
leading
by
double
figures
and
rand
paul
is
down
to
less
than
and
he
attacked
me
now
bush
also
just
went
down
in
the
poll
very
big
so
know
are
they
going
to
spend
going
to
spend
lobbyist
money
and
special
interest
money
remember
this
they
have
total
control
over
and
and
everybody
else
that
takes
that
money
nobody
knows
the
system
better
than
me
they
have
total
control
you
understand
it
very
well
because
been
covering
it
for
long
time
those
people
that
are
putting
up
those
millions
of
dollars
have
total
control
over
your
candidate
will
tell
you
this
putting
up
millions
of
dollars
for
me
putting
up
my
own
money
in
fact
feel
little
bit
foolish
people
are
offering
me
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
you
know
when
in
first
place
you
can
collect
so
much
money
and
keep
turning
them
down
feel
like
am
fool
feel
very
foolish
and
when
was
in
last
week
said
what
do
you
think
can
take
one
man
offered
me
big
lobbyist
offered
million
for
my
campaign
said
to
the
crowd
in
great
crowd
people
said
can
take
it
and
would
you
believe
not
going
to
do
anything
promise
you
swear
to
you
do
anything
and
they
all
stood
up
and
said
no
no
take
it
the
fact
is
the
only
putting
up
my
own
money
know
there
have
been
some
super
or
super
where
people
are
forming
super
for
trump
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
as
you
know
not
allowed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
so
know
what
going
to
do
hopefully
if
going
to
do
something
going
to
be
nice
but
know
anything
about
them
but
just
in
nutshell
funding
my
own
campaign
nobody
when
people
advertise
and
hope
the
voters
can
see
this
every
negative
they
see
about
me
is
paid
for
by
lobbyists
and
special
interests
so
just
remember
that
our
country
could
be
doing
much
better
we
have
deficits
that
are
enormous
we
have
all
bad
trade
agreements
we
have
an
army
that
the
heads
said
is
not
prepared
we
have
military
that
needs
help
and
especially
in
these
times
we
have
nuclear
weapons
that
you
look
at
minutes
they
even
work
okay
if
anybody
saw
that
report
the
phones
work
years
old
they
have
wires
that
are
no
good
nothing
works
our
country
work
everybody
wins
except
us
we
need
victories
in
this
country
we
have
victories
any
more
our
country
will
be
great
again
but
right
now
our
country
has
major
problems
think
great
that
in
the
debate
was
in
of
her
being
think
she
should
be
in
the
debate
like
the
fact
that
there
are
people
now
as
understand
it
not
getting
rid
of
rand
paul
or
somebody
but
think
they
should
because
too
many
people
because
when
you
have
not
getting
to
hear
me
and
not
getting
to
hear
other
people
talking
and
think
too
bad
think
is
lot
of
people
but
was
very
happy
that
she
got
into
the
debate
because
frankly
she
deserves
to
be
in
the
debate
think
maybe
inclined
not
to
get
in
the
race
think
going
to
depend
on
what
happens
with
lot
of
people
think
that
she
will
not
be
able
to
make
it
legally
from
criminal
standpoint
to
the
starting
gate
know
that
to
be
true
but
think
it
depends
on
what
happens
with
her
think
if
she
gets
out
he
will
get
in
think
if
she
stays
in
he
might
not
who
knows
oh
not
supposed
to
be
here
because
he
was
here
he
was
up
in
my
office
and
he
got
the
pledge
and
very
happy
about
that
we
want
anything
and
told
him
said
know
if
appropriate
for
you
to
be
here
because
want
anything
you
know
you
guys
will
end
up
saying
endorsing
trump
so
suggested
frankly
that
fine
with
him
not
being
here
because
want
anybody
to
think
endorsing
as
far
as
is
concerned
watched
him
this
morning
on
television
and
little
bit
sad
forget
he
was
supposed
to
win
and
he
just
have
the
energy
but
what
he
does
have
is
lot
of
money
that
was
given
to
him
again
by
special
interests
donors
and
lobbyists
and
just
hope
that
if
he
spends
money
on
which
he
may
not
if
were
him
spend
money
on
positive
about
himself
because
if
he
knocks
me
assuming
people
leave
and
maybe
at
point
where
not
going
to
leave
because
fed
up
with
happening
in
this
country
but
think
going
to
go
to
people
other
than
know
right
now
interested
in
jobs
one
thing
one
of
the
groups
it
was
actually
say
that
but
they
did
very
massive
poll
and
came
out
number
one
in
leadership
number
one
on
the
economy
number
one
in
jobs
producing
and
mean
by
number
one
mean
like
number
one
by
many
many
times
and
am
so
intent
on
putting
people
back
to
work
in
this
country
you
know
we
have
million
people
that
are
not
in
the
workforce
right
now
million
when
they
give
up
looking
for
job
they
take
them
off
of
the
they
take
them
off
the
statistics
we
have
million
people
we
have
million
people
between
poverty
levels
and
welfare
and
all
our
country
can
be
great
again
we
have
to
put
people
back
to
work
would
bring
my
children
into
the
administration
will
tell
you
they
are
very
capable
the
answer
is
probably
not
but
having
them
in
would
be
very
good
very
very
capable
children
the
second
part
bother
asking
you
no
longer
pertinent
west
you
know
what
never
say
bad
about
him
you
know
why
because
he
loves
trump
he
loves
trump
he
goes
around
saying
trump
is
my
hero
he
says
it
to
everybody
so
west
love
him
now
maybe
in
few
years
have
to
run
against
him
know
so
take
that
back
but
been
so
nice
to
me
you
people
have
sort
of
seen
because
been
only
hit
people
when
they
hit
me
only
and
west
has
been
so
great
would
never
say
bad
about
him
because
he
says
such
nice
things
about
me
no
my
supporters
are
really
supporting
me
because
very
competent
because
they
know
that
not
going
to
let
china
rip
us
off
not
going
to
let
japan
rip
us
off
japan
is
devaluing
their
yen
very
hard
for
caterpillar
and
other
companies
to
compete
against
their
big
tractor
maker
and
others
not
going
to
let
this
happen
anymore
they
do
you
talk
about
trade
imbalance
they
have
in
japan
the
biggest
ships
ever
seen
pouring
cars
into
pouring
them
in
never
seen
anything
like
it
we
send
them

even
want
it
going

something
much
better
and
much
less
expensive
going
to
get
rid
of
it
going
to
repeal

and
going
to
take
this
country
back
and
going
to
make
this
country
so
great
again
and
so
strong
again
just
want
to
tell
you
about
so
years
ago
many
years
ago
like
hate
to
say
but
say
but
close
to
came
to
did
you
ever
hear
of
company
called
right
so
they
were
based
in
and
they
owned
the
teller
department
store
chain
and
was
young
guy
and
came
from
brooklyn
in
queens
and
wanted
to
go
into
and
went
into
and
did
the
grand
hotel
and
did
some
other
things
that
were
good
but
the
thing
wanted
more
than
anything
was
fifth
avenue
between
and
street
which
is
called
the
location
right
next
to
and
what
wanted
wanted
that
piece
of
property
so
badly
say
that
because
not
supposed
to
want
things
like
that
so
badly
god
will
get
angry
at
me
right
but
wanted
it
so
badly
and
the
company
that
owned
it
was
based
in
and
came
in
and
came
to
and
met
with
the
heads
of
who
were
really
great
people
actually
and
they
were
having
lot
of
difficulties
there
were
lot
of
fighting
and
lot
of
everything
and
convinced
them
to
sell
me
the
land
and
the
building
and
bought
the
teller
store
fifth
avenue
from
to
street
surrounding
bought
all
the
air
rights
and
then
ultimately
bought
the
air
rights
from
and
built
trump
tower
and
to
this
day
one
of
the
great
buildings
of
the
world
and
one
of
the
great
successes
and
love
country
music
and
went
to
the
grand
ole
while
was
here
and
just
had
such
an
incredible
experience
and
when
it
came
down
to
speaking
because
we
could
speak
at
lot
of
places
you
know
when
leading
in
every
poll
they
sort
of
want
you
when
not
leading
in
the
polls
like
so
many
of
these
guys
they
want
you
at
all
and
talk
about
the
polls
in
second
but
had
lot
of
choices
for
this
morning
and
guess
could
have
also
gone
and
played
golf
like
the
president
does
all
the
time
right
but
decided
do
this
and
really
chose
because
the
experience
is
one
of
my
not
my
biggest
deal
but
in
terms
of
deal
so
important
and
been
such
great
from
the
day
built
it
it
was
home
run
and
it
all
really
took
place
because
of
so
really
an
to
be
with
you
folks
can
tell
you
real
so
coming
over
heard
and
watched
television
you
know
they
have
all
these
cameras
back
there
and
live
and
guess
live
on
live
on
so
many
different
things
always
difficult
you
know
when
always
live
got
to
change
up
your
you
make
the
over
and
the
other
candidates
get
covered
live
ever
except
for
the
debate
so
you
know
they
had
million
people
on
the
debate
now
they
think
when
the
new
numbers
come
out
be
even
substantially
higher
than
that
so
said
they
would
have
had
million
or
two
so
say
they
have
million
people
and
say
well
now
the
second
debate
which
is
on
that
was
on
fox
maybe
should
ask
for
lot
of
money
and
give
the
money
to
charity
does
that
make
sense
all
to
charity
all
to
charity
when
said
that
to
the
writers
at
time
magazine
they
were
nice
enough
to
put
me
on
the
cover
with
actually
nice
story
and
said
you
know
and
sort
of
thought
said
it
off
the
record
but
they
put
it
in
time
magazine
so
now
maybe
should
ask
for
charity
maybe
nice
charity
and
american
cancer
society
and
aids
research
so
many
of
this
so
many
good
you
know
so
many
things
going
on
maybe
should
ask
for
lot
of
money
or
not
showing
up
you
know
interesting
so
get
million
million
to
million
people
at
the
debates
you
know
been
doing
them
for
long
time
they
do
great
especially
the
early
republican
debate
like
you
know
the
expression
it
draws
flies
what
it
draws
so
this
was
one
of
the
biggest
shows
in
the
history
of
cable
television
think
it
might
have
been
the
biggest
in
terms
of
political
in
the
history
of
cable
television
naturally
took
full
credit
for
it
which
in
all
fairness
should
should
so
bottom
line
think
might
ask
for
lot
of
money
for
charity
but
you
know
but
did
say
is
it
little
if
do
that
maybe
not
so
nice
so
what
do
you
think
should
do
it
or
not
maybe
not
know
the
thing
if
do
it
just
makes
lot
of
money
care
about
honestly
no
going
to
make
lot
of
money
they
just
shut
off
their
camera
actually
very
nice
but
going
to
make
lot
of
money
and
you
know
something
we
should
consider
so
all
consider
it
together
but
coming
over
today
saw
that
they
were
having
the
illegal
immigrants
come
in
and
somebody
mentioned
the
term
the
dreamers
having
to
do
with
children
and
you
know
the
dreams
of
children
and
these
are
people
who
come
over
to
the
country
and
dreamers
and
said
what
about
our
children
why
our
children
that
are
in
the
country
why
they
be
the
dreamers
nobody
ever
talks
about
that
no
no
nobody
ever
talks
about
that
you
know
we
talk
about
the
dreamers
we
talk
about
illegal
immigrants
who
by
the
way
are
treated
better
than
our
vets
you
know
our
vets
are
incredible
no
no
the
illegal
immigrants
in
many
treated
better
than
our
veterans
who
are
the
greatest
people
we
have
our
wounded
warriors
are
these
are
the
greatest
people
we
have
and
another
thing
nice
about
being
able
to
make
speeches
without
having
to
hire
some
guy
to
write
and
keep
writing
and
reading
it
and
put
then
say
good
morning
ladies
and
gentlemen
wonderful
you
know
is
that
can
sort
of
be
very
current
okay
can
be
very
very
current
can
talk
about
happening
this
morning
on
the
television
they
had
whole
story
about
the
veterans
administration
and
the
hospitals
how
people
are
waiting
on
lines
to
get
in
these
are
our
veterans
these
are
the
people
that
got
hurt
fighting
for
us
maybe
we
be
here
if
it
for
them
to
be
honest
with
you
mean
possible
too
they
had
story
this
morning
on
fox
on
and
number
of
them
where
the
veterans
are
just
treated
terribly
and
they
showed
desk
where
supposed
to
be
people
behind
this
desk
and
they
showed
this
desk
and
nobody
there
and
the
veterans
know
probably
some
of
you
saw
it
the
veterans
are
saying
where
are
the
people
and
then
they
said
what
happened
and
they
said
this
happens
all
the
time
there
was
not
even
nobody
even
there
and
two
weeks
ago
on
they
had
the
longest
wait
in
the
history
in
the
history
of
the
veterans
administration
for
people
wanting
to
see
doctor
when
go
to
doctor
if
have
to
wait
like
minutes
like
get
me
go
crazy
true
remember
the
old
days
when
the
doctor
used
to
come
to
your
house
right
remembers
that
have
cold
the
doctor
would
come
over
carrying
little
bag
like
this
big
beautiful
little
bag
being
at
the
top
and
come
over
to
your
house
check
you
out
fine
those
days
exist
anymore
you
know
in
age
of
where
nothing
exists
by
the
way
we
will
repeal
and
replace
that
can
tell
you
that
can
tell
you
but
so
two
weeks
ago
the
longest
wait
in
the
history
of
the
veterans
administration
so
that
if
you
go
to
the
office
men
and
women
are
waiting
four
days
three
days
one
was
five
days
one
case
was
five
days
or
six
days
finally
got
to
see
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
excused
himself
because
he
was
going
on
vacation
now
you
think
about
that
can
you
imagine
waiting
even
day
or
half
day
but
these
people
are
waiting
four
five
days
so
the
now
the
longest
in
history
and
the
way
treating
our
greatest
people
and
not
right
and
going
to
change
that
going
to
change
that
we
have
right
now
and
people
know
this
you
know
they
see
these
phony
statistics
put
out
by
politicians
basically
all
talk
no
action
politicians
and
mean
on
both
sides
in
all
fairness
you
know
republican
conservative
but
just
as
angry
with
the
republicans
because
they
go
to
washington
something
happens
they
become
weak
you
know
they
go
to
washington
going
to
stop
going
to
stop
this
going
to
do
this
going
to
do
that
then
they
walk
into
these
magnificent
buildings
with
those
incredible
vaulted
ceilings
and
they
go
oh
made
it
darling
made
it
vote
for
you
vote
for
you
vote
for
expansions
do
whatever
you
want
me
to
do
in
washington
amazing
it
amazing
you
agree
happen
to
me
promise
and
if
it
does
you
can
let
me
know
about
it
but
it
promise
promise
but
you
know
they
show
those
phony
statistics
where
unemployment
the
real
number
you
know
actually
saw
number
it
could
be
okay
believe
it
or
not
but
when
you
think
about
it
we
have
million
people
that
are
right
now
out
of
the
force
million
people
of
the
many
of
these
people
want
jobs
and
they
quit
looking
so
if
looking
for
job
and
you
find
it
and
you
stop
for
while
you
know
after
while
you
sort
of
like
not
happening
not
going
to
happen
know
what
they
do
but
they
stop
they
are
considered
statistically
employed
okay
so
we
have
million
people
out
of
the
force
mean
think
about
it
hard
to
believe
we
have
million
people
in
poverty
these
are
very
new
numbers
million
people
in
poverty
taking
our
money
taking
our
money
mexico
is
beating
us
at
the
border

on
trade

the
way
killing
us

but
you

but
one
of
the
polls
came
out
because
in
south
and
north
leading
really
big
and
in
south
poll
came
out
and
we
had
statement
that
my
level
of
popularity
or
you
know
the
only
one
that
can
get
poll
and
it
comes
out
and
these
guys
in
the
back
with
all
those
red
lights
on
will
say
think
had
one
poll
where
almost
can
you
imagine
people
so
at
with
people
and
they
said
at
but
look
you
even
hear
it
you
know
trump
says
nobody
knows
what
they
just
said
but
there
are
some
people
that
like
him
unbelievable
the
only
one
that
wins
these
polls
and
get
negative
publicity
no
incredible
the
press
yesterday
you
might
have
seen
me
was
in
south
made
had
to
bring
it
up
the
new
york
times
to
me
is
big
deal
you
know
from
new
york
very
liberal
paper
but
okay
you
know
not
everybody
could
be
like
us
but
still
the
new
york
times
right
we
have
to
admit
still
the
new
york
times
and
on
the
front
page
lot
on
the
new
york
times
and
to
be
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
is
big
deal
but
yesterday
or
two
days
ago
they
had
story
about
me
and
they
had
some
low
level
hispanic
commentator
low
level
guy
this
one
like
me
by
the
way
think
going
to
win
the
hispanic
vote
and
think
you
know
in
won
the
hispanic
poll
they
love
me
love
the
hispanic
people
incredible
energy
incredible
people
love
the
people
have
so
many
have
thousands
that
work
for
me
and
thousands
and
thousands
over
the
years
and
have
worked
for
me
great
people
and
said
going
to
win
and
lot
of
the
that
are
here
legally
they
want
people
coming
in
illegally
you
know
true
true
so
this
poll
that
comes
out
think
it
was
in
south
where
way
up
and
at
and
the
senator
at
so
wrote
him
note
congratulations
only
beating
you
in
your
home
state
by
points
so
anyways
who
cares
but
they
did
something
that
nobody
reported
they
say
oh
but
do
people
like
trump
by
the
way
this
election
is
not
going
to
be
like
think
nice
person
love
people
want
to
help
people
health
issues
to
me
are
very
important
to
bush
it
important
because
he
want
to
fund
them
and
then
he
said
oh
but
you
know
really
want
to
be
nice
person
and
am
nice
person
but
think
actually
going
to
be
an
election
based
on
competence
tired
of
being
like
the
for
everybody
really
do
think
time
but
in
the
poll
this
was
the
poll
big
poll
highly
re
in
another
act
of
political
managed
to
flip
his
rating
from
negative
nobody
wrote
this
by
the
way
nobody
said
it
nobody
reported
it
from
negative
to
positive
this
is
an
exact
quote
have
like
this
photographic
memory
so
need
but
want
to
be
sure
because
if
used
the
word
the
incorrectly
say
he
rating
from
negative
to
positive
in
one
poll
during
the
span
of
month
feat
that
highly
respected
pollster
called
astounding
called
it
astounding
nobody
else
wrote
about
it
that
defies
any
rule
in
presidential
politics
that
ever
seen
said
this
highly
respected
man
murray
the
director
of
the
polling
institute
said
he
flipped
it
from
to
in
one
month
and
he
said
that
never
seen
that
before
and
you
know
what
because
people
have
heard
me
and
they
say
such
nice
person
no
they
want
they
say
man
made
tremendous
amount
of
money
had
tremendous
success
and
say
that
the
kind
of
thinking
we
need
in
the
country
mean
whatever
it
is
but
to
me
that
statement
was
more
important
than
actually
literally
killing
everybody
in
the
poll
we
were
much
much
higher
more
than
double
everybody
and
we
are
more
than
double
everybody
you
saw
the
just
came
out
and
that
was
an
amazing
poll
was
the
same
thing
much
much
higher
double
and
triple
and
quadruple
many
of
these
candidates
and
the
reason
is
people
in
this
country
are
smart
they
believe
lot
of
what
they
see
in
the
media
because
if
you
believe
these
people
you
know
why
are
they
doing
this
mean
why
are
they
even
saying
it
think
that
if
good
for
the
country
and
be
great
for
the
country
because
going
to
make
great
deals
for
our
country
we
win
anymore
our
country
win
anymore
think
somebody
even
liberal
person
or
democrat
liberal
and
mean
really
liberal
somebody
going
to
make
the
country
why
are
they
knocking
it
why
are
they
knocking
why
do
they
fight
think
say
do
it
good
good
for
all
of
us
because
our
country
is
in
trouble
we
owe
now
trillion
you
know
been
saying
trillion
for
while
now
but
now
it
starts
to
go
up
quickly
and
by
the
way
when
kicks
in
which
is
really
kicking
in
in
you
want
to
see
bad
deficits
you
want
to
see
it
go
up
going
to
really
see
it
go
up
because
that
has
huge
negative
impact
not
only
on
jobs
but
on
the
deficit
itself
because
of
the
costs
and
no
good
have
you
noticed
and
seen
it
yourself
the
premiums
have
gone
through
the
roof
right
the
unless
close
to
death
never
going
to
use
it
you
use
it
because
the
is
so
high
but
the
premiums
are
up
and
and
more
disaster
and
on
top
of
that
going
to
cost
the
country
fortune
so
not
only
costing
you
lot
of
money
going
to
cost
the
country
fortune
so
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
and
we
have
to
do
something
importantly
about
it
but
when
see
the
people
on
television
and
have
to
tell
you
mention
names
some
of
them
when
they
hear
my
name
was
talking
we
have
great
reporter
today
from
the
wall
street
journal
with
us
okay
who
came
down
and
she
actually
said
some
of
them
when
they
hear
your
name
it
looks
like
boiler
waiting
to
explode
true
number
one
they
look
bad
because
they
said
do
you
remember
the
beginning
like
three
four
months
ago
they
said
clown
clown
just
having
fun
you
know
went
to
great
school
did
great
did
everything
was
great
came
out
made
fortune
which
want
to
use
the
brain
for
you
but
made
fortune
then
did
book
called
the
art
of
the
deal
and
many
bestsellers
the
art
of
the
deal
being
probably
the
best
selling
business
book
of
all
time
who
has
read
the
art
of
the
deal
yeah
most
people
most
everybody
jokingly
say
but
mean
it
the
bible
tops
it
by
long
way
say
that
say
that
said
it
the
first
time
in
people
liked
that
but
true
nothing
tops
the
bible
but
the
art
of
the
deal
great
success
many
books
bestsellers
many
many
bestsellers
then
do
the
apprentice
never
done
television
do
the
apprentice
one
of
the
most
successful
shows
ever
on
television
by
the
way
and
renewed
the
apprentice
you
know
that
right
for
me
they
came
up
to
my
office
the
head
of
great
guy
use
names
just
say
no
honestly
great
guy
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
he
came
up
with
the
heads
of
six
months
ago
and
they
said
renewing
the
apprentice
please
have
to
do
you
have
to
do
it
said
honestly
running
for
president
want
to
make
our
country
great
again
want
to
make
and
they
believe
me
and
said
it
four
times
they
believe
me
nobody
believed
that
was
going
to
run
nobody
my
wife
even
believe
me
but
now
she
does
but
she
actually
said
if
you
actually
say
going
to
run
going
to
do
great
because
people
like
you
she
actually
said
love

but
want
to
brag
but
she
said
if
you
actually
run
not
you
may
run
you
may
not
run
who
knows
but
she
said
if
you
actually
say
so
the
guys
come
up
terrific
people
mean
honestly
had
great
relationship
with
for
years
we
had
many
many
you
know
number
ones
and
the
apprentice
continues
to
do
great
you
know
last
season
you
know
how
well
it
did
so
they
wanted
to
renew
it
for
many
many
shows
in
fact
mark
called
up
you
know
mark
he
did
survivor
apprentice
so
mark
great
guy
he
calls
up
and
he
goes
believe
it
not
taking
renewal
the
word
is
renewal
said
right
mark
going
to
run
for
president
no
no
no
you
have
to
nobody
take
renewal
unheard
of
in
primetime
television
two
hours
primetime
are
you
crazy
said
mark
have
to
do
this
done
so
well
in
this
country
have
to
do
it
we
can
save
our
country
we
can
save
our
country
so
anyways
the
bottom
line
renewed
it
told
them
not
doing
it
and
then
they
finally
believed
me
when
actually
announced
they
like
me
anymore
amazing
they
do
not
like
me
but
too
bad
too
bad
well
thank
you
you
know
the
funny
thing
about
the
apprentice
there
have
been
copies
of
the
apprentice
every
single
one
of
them
failed
so
then
reporter
said
to
me
why
do
you
think
that
is
said
because
special
and
was
kidding
was
doing
it
sarcastically
mean
sort
of
meant
it
to
be
honest
right
but
was
sort
of
kidding
and
they
wrote
it
and
hated
the
way
it
looked
in
writing
you
know
it
sounds
good
when
you
say
it
but
oh
it
looks
so
bad
in
writing
but
so
had
great
experience
so
here
am
great
schools
great
brain
great
success
built
great
company
do
the
apprentice
tremendous
success
when
did
the
apprentice
certain
critic
said
it
will
never
be
successful
because
you
know
to
have
big
hit
really
number
one
hit
you
have
to
and
you
remember
that
first
season
it
had
one
of
the
highest
ratings
ever
the
finale
of
the
apprentice
aye
remember
with
the
great
bill
remember
how
that
was
incredible
but
to
have
great
success
you
have
to
have
women
and
never
forget
saved
the
article
right
like
harry
saved
it
where
it
said
loses
and
he
actually
won
remember
but
saved
this
article
they
said
trump
can
never
succeed
on
television
because
why
would
women
want
to
watch
trump
and
said
am
so
bad
am
so
bad
tell
me
am
so
bad
and
it
turned
out
that
women
were
the
biggest
base
mean
those
were
the
ones
that
you
know
saved
those
things
but
no
matter
how
you
cut
it
we
can
do
something
so
incredible
and
honestly
going
to
be
hard
going
to
be
lot
of
work
going
to
be
lot
of
time
leave
the
white
house
you
know
always
leaves
the
white
house
think
of
it
elected
president
in
the
white
house
why
would
you
want
to
leave
think
maybe
never
leave
how
cool
is
that
he
leaves
to
go
to
some
place
and
go
fundraisers
try
know
maybe
some
rules
against
it
so
maybe
but
do
the
fundraisers
in
the
white
house
he
and
his
wife
left
think
one
was
doing
the
show
another
was
doing
another
show
right
next
door
in
california
they
left
couple
of
hours
difference
one
took
air
force
one
one
took
beautiful
two
planes
little
bit
different
timing
going
to
the
same
location
going
to
the
same
airport
to
do
different
shows
and
say
why
why
they
flying
at
least
the
same
plane
now
know
what
those
suckers
cost
because
happen
to
have
one
of
them
right
so
know
what
it
costs
to
operate
these
importantly
the
time
and
the
energy
but
would
have
said
or
would
have
said
whoever
was
doing
the
show
do
it
from
the
white
house
this
way
take
half
and
hour
go
back
spend
any
money
of
the
taxpayers
you
know
the
funny
thing
is
that
whoever
the
host
is
would
like
it
better
doing
our
show
live
from
the
white
house
or
something
so
we
pay
any
money
we
have
to
fuel
up
air
force
one
which
costs
you
do
you
ever
see
what
it
costs
to
travel
in
these
things
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
security
and
closing
down
california
mean
every
time
comes
to
to
do
fundraiser
which
is
often
say
going
on
you
move
they
closed
down
all
the
streets
they
closed
down
the
city
and
he
could
do
it
from
like
washington
in
fact
he
could
do
it
in
my
new
hotel
that
buying
which
is
only
couple
of
blocks
true
building
this
incredible
hotel
on
avenue
and
going
to
be
incredible
the
old
post
office
and
actually
got
it
from
the
administration
which
is
hard
to
believe
people
say
going
on
how
did
trump
get
it
one
of
the
most
heavily
sought
after
buildings
in
the
history
of
the
general
services
administration
which
owned
it
you
know
the
ones
that
made
the
decision
and
got
it
and
building
this
phenomenal
hotel
trump
international
hotel
right
on
avenue
directly
between
congress
and
the
white
house
right
going
to
open
just
in
time
and
by
the
way
listen
to
this
one
under
budget
and
ahead
of
schedule
do
you
ever
hear
that
from
government
way
under
budget
so
actually
going
to
be
opening
and
be
great
but
he
can
use
my
hotel
let
him
use
it
free
you
just
come
in
use
it
go
back
to
the
white
house
but
you
have
to
do
that
but
say
to
yourself
why
you
know
mindset
but
more
importantly
even
in
the
travel
we
have
so
many
things
that
we
have
to
do
to
straighten
out
our
country
you
want
to
waste
time
got
to
do
this
got
to
make
deals
got
the
greatest
deal
makers
in
the
world
lined
up
to
make
deals
for
us
incredible
guy
right
incredible
guy
great
deal
maker
got
some
of
the
greatest
deal
makers
in
the
world
all
calling
me
too
they
said
you
ask
me
have
these
guys
calling
me
up
the
best
in
the
world
now
know
the
best
also
know
guys
that
are
overrated
know
guys
that
you
heard
of
that
honestly
are
phenomenal
know
lot
that
you
have
heard
of
that
really
that
good
that
are
overrated
in
my
opinion
but
the
best
in
the
world
and
calling
me
they
want
money
worth
billions
of
dollars
but
when
put
say
and
say
do
me
handle
china
going
to
make
great
deal
no
no
going
to
make
great
deal
because
what
happens
you
know
what
happens
so
going
to
take
back
our
trade
if
you
look
at
china
if
you
look
at
japan
was
in
few
weeks
ago
saw
ships
the
biggest
ships
ever
seen
with
cars
pouring
our
pouring
out
one
after
another
made
in
japan
very
nice
nice
except
that
it
help
us
when
does
it
help
us
when
does
it
help
us
we
sell
them
beef
beef
and
then
they
want
it
because
you
know
do
you
ever
see
going
on
over
there
we
sell
the
beef
and
it
goes
over
there
and
very
perishable
so
by
the
time
it
gets
over
there
then
they
turn
it
over
we
want
it
they
have
cars
coming
from
these
massive
massive
ships
massive
and
they
just
pour
off
the
ships
and
say
what
are
we
doing
how
stupid
are
we
no
tax
no
nothing
and
free
trader
believe
in
free
trade
have
to
say
but
have
to
be
fair
trade
when
you
look
at
japan
they
take
in
money
up
here
and
we
give
them
money
down
here
we
get
nothing
by
comparison
like
peanuts
balance
it
out
fellows
balance
it
out
got
to
balance
it
friend
of
mine
is
great
manufacturer
as
you
know
china
has
probably
the
greatest
theft
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
what
china
has
done
to
us
taken
our
money
taken
our
jobs
taken
everything
taken
so
much
and
creating
bubble
and
you
know
interestingly
so
intertwined
that
now
the
bubble
could
take
us
down
if
it
explodes
which
at
some
point
it
might
and
got
to
be
smart
made
so
much
money
dealing
with
china
made
hundreds
of
millions
probably
billions
dealing
with
china
the
bank
of
america
building
in
san
own
big
chunk
of
that
which
nobody
knows
nobody
knows
you
know
all
these
guys
come
to
oh
worth
only
billion
or
billion
or
whatever
only
worth
billion
like
bankrupt
even
know
my
numbers
they
said
well
we
been
able
to
look
at
about
of
his
companies
so
filed
interestingly
they
said
never
run
never
run
announced
then
they
said
oh
never
file
his
form
whatever
single
page
where
basically
signing
your
life
away
and
it
has
to
be
done
within
days
of
the
announcement
signed
my
form
and
they
said
well
never
ever
put
in
his
and
you
have
like
days
or
something
and
they
said
ask
for
extensions
but
never
show
because
probably
not
as
rich
as
people
think
but
actually
much
richer
and
put
in
my
true
true
and
and
another
group
said
no
no
we
know
what
these
companies
are
put
in
these
massive
and
you
know
was
so
proud
might
have
filed
if
going
to
run
wanted
to
show
people
wanted
to
brag
such
great
company
built
so
they
said
never
put
in
his
put
in
the
and
everybody
much
bigger
much
bigger
you
know
very
little
debt
tremendous
value
and
really
great
assets
iconic
assets
you
know
iconic
in
scotland
mean
have
some
of
the
greatest
real
estates
in
the
world
and
very
proud
of
it
but
they
say
never
file
never
file
then
they
see
all
these
companies
and
you
know
they
have
boxes
and
because
it
really
meant
for
somebody
like
me
and
they
have
these
little
boxes
they
say
is
it
worth
or
does
he
make
million
from
million
to
million
from
million
to
million
from
million
to
million
the
last
box
is
million
or
more
million
or
more
so
like
have
lot
of
buildings
that
are
worth
much
more
than
that
have
lot
of
assets
that
are
worth
much
more
than
that
so
it
says
million
or
more
so
checked
many
of
them
know
how
many
think
of
them
can
you
believe
it
so
checked
like
know
think
could
be
wrong
oh
kill
me
if
wrong
but
not
sure
but
think
like
boxes
million
or
more
so
you
know
when
some
of
these
guys
do
to
try
and
always
you
they
added
up
now
some
of
the
are
worth
billion
some
of
them
are
worth
more
than
billion
so
it
says
million
or
more
go
so
take
million
for
building
that
might
be
worth
billion
and
honestly
much
more
and
they
add
them
up
and
they
say
well
worth
billion
really
this
is
the
press
and
they
have
no
clue
those
statements
really
meant
for
me
not
meant
for
guy
like
me
but
with
all
of
that
the
statements
were
so
good
so
good
so
good
and
you
know
one
of
the
things
doing
and
last
night
was
incredible
we
had
an
amazing
event
in
right
oh
look
at
this
we
have
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
in
what
are
you
doing
so
here
am
spent
millions
of
dollars
during
the
course
on
jet
fuel
okay
like
lot
of

somebody
puts
up
sign
to
go
to
this
thing
know
who

over
the
place

millions
want
your
money

make
but
they
put
it
up
all
over
trump
is
asking

fly
my
plane
some
place
it
costs
me
fortune
the
fuel
the
the
money
that
raised
last
night
which
says
it
all
it
goes
towards
paying
off
like
the
expense
or
something
the
guy
that
had
it
is
great
guy

they
come
out
with
new
poll
right
hey
rich
could
hire
hundred
poll
want
to
waste
money
you
know
why
should
pay
know
in
one
month
and
you
know
then
arrogant
guys
they
think
hot
stuff
and
they
tell
the
candidates
what
to
say
got
to
say
this
got
to
be
politically
correct
no
way
have
time
to
be
political
no
true
true
have
time
to
be
political
you
know
it
takes
lot
of
time
to
be
politically
correct
you
saw
the
anchor
baby
thing
did
you
see
that
with
where
on
and
somebody
the
same
network
again
he
said
you
know
the
name
anchor
baby
is
very
insulting
said
what
would
you
call
it
and
he
gave
me
like
nine
words
baby
of
illegal
immigrant
who
was
brought
to
the
country
to
this
and
that
said
how
can
say
that
too
long
anchor
baby
and
then
bush
bush
gets
caught
because
he
is
such
nice
person
honestly
if
you
want
nice
person
honestly
you
should
vote
for
the
country
is
going
to
go
to
hell
but
we
talk
of
that
no
no
but
if
you
want
nice
person
so
has
memo
that
he
signed
of
basically
politically
correct
memo
you
know
say
this
say
that
all
these
things
pages
of
stuff
but
one
of
the
things
never
use
the
term
so
all
of
sudden
using
the
term
anchor
baby
just
last
week
and
with
me
when
use
it
nobody
me
they
expect
me
they
gave
up
okay
with
him
they
killed
him
they
just
killed
him
it
stop
and
then
he
blamed
it
on
the
asians
he
said
you
know
did
you
see
that
and
then
the
new
york
times
did
an
editorial
how
dare
you
attack
the
asians
so
he
wanted
to
steer
away
from
the
he
said
well
you
know
the
asians
come
in
and
they
also
have
anchor
babies
and
now
the
asians
all
hate
him
true
but
the
asians
love
me
and
love
them
love
them
so
he
has
memo
and
he
signs
the
memo
and
it
says
couple
of
years
ago
use
this
term
and
now
using
it
because
he
has
to
because
baby
you
know
think
of
it
think
of
it
want
to
build
wall
okay
so
easy
so
easy
when
this
clown
or
whatever
the
hell
his
name
no
baseball
player
actually
is
baseball
player
nice
baseball
player
but
when
got
up
the
other
day
screaming
and
ranting
and
going
crazy
and
had
all
these
reporters
actually
the
reporters
were
mostly
on
my
side
because
they
all
had
their
hand
up
but
this
guy
starts
screaming
so
even
had
liberal
people
from
actually
said
to
the
guy
yes
and
this
guy
stands
up
and
starts
screaming
so
when
he
and
actually
got
lot
of
credit
for
the
way
we
handled
him
do
anything
like
do
anything
except
for
the
times
and
what
alluded
to
before
the
times
said
trump
railed
at
him
and
screamed
at
him
scream
at
him
but
he
was
screaming
at
me
and
much
worse
than
that
they
said
wore
toupee
can
you
believe
it
wear
toupee
and
proved
it
bring
anybody
up
bring
anybody
up
but
but
think
of
it
in
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
and
in
the
first
sentence
in
the
first
paragraph
has
this
announcer
this
hispanic
announcer
that
nobody
ever
heard
of
saying
they
called
him
something
which
means
he
wears
toupee
and
so
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
even
talk
about
it
embarrassed
to
talk
about
it
but
they
also
said
was
essentially
screaming
at
this
guy
from
who
happen
to
be
suing
for
million
they
mention
that
they
also
mention
that
his
daughter
works
for
did
you
know
that
his
daughter
works
for
oh
you
know
that
oh
no
they
mention
that
no
no
they
said
was
wearing
toupee
and
was
screaming
but
they
no
screaming
at
me
so
we
very
nicely
and
then
we
let
him
come
back
and
we
actually
had
nice
talk
he
actually
seemed
like
nice
guy
after
he
calmed
down
little
bit
you
know
very
emotional
man
but
he
said
you
build
wall
because
you
do
it
so
years
ago
in
china
we
always
get
back
to
china
years
ago
the
great
wall
of
china
oh
like
to
have
wall
this
is
serious
wall
okay
this
is
wall
you
go
through
so
easy
they
built
wall
years
ago
miles
think
of
that
big
wall
serious
wall
right
this
was
years
ago
mean
it
took
them
like
years
to
build
it
so
you
know
got
to
be
little
bit
you
know
took
long
time
but
miles
long
time
they
had
no
tractors
they
have
caterpillars
of
course
today
we
use
because
made
in
japan
and
you
could
buy
them
cheaper
how
stupid
is
that
because
they
devalued
the
yen
so
much
and
people
are
buying
instead
of
caterpillars
stock
is
down
terrible
change
that
around
believe
me
believe
me
but
they
build
this
wall
now
we
have
really
would
say
look
we
have
miles
as
opposed
to
but
you
need
it
on
all
of
it
because
some
you
have
natural
landscaping
some
you
have
lot
of
places
and
actually
years
ago
everybody
wanted
the
wall
built
wanted
it
built
but
they
because
great
builder
what
do
best
is
build
not
rendering
guy
do
the
building
and
then
do
the
rendering
lot
of
these
guys
come
in
with
renderings
and
it
never
gets
built
does
that
make
sense
to
anybody
the
opposite
get
it
built
so
one
of
the
reasons
it
get
built
is
because
they
get
an
approved
environmental
impact
study
do
you
believe
this
no
no
they
had
certain
snail
and
different
things
they
get
it
they
could
not
get
an
environmental
impact
study
approved
to
build
wall
and
killing
people
we
have
illegal
immigrants
you
see
that
with
in
san
you
see
it
with
you
see
it
with
so
many
people
last
night
in
met
some
unbelievable
families
that
have
been
devastated
by
illegal
immigrants
they
come
into
this
country
and
kill
members
of
their
family
last
week
in
california
veteran
female
veteran
got
raped
tortured
and
killed
raped
tortured
and
killed
by
an
illegal
immigrant
that
they
caught
that
they
caught
luckily
but
this
is
what
we
have
we
have
stupid
people
in
our
government
and
we
have
people
pouring
across
the
border
and
you
know
what
we
have
great
border
patrol
people
went
there
you
probably
saw
that
why
the
hat
is
so
successful
the
white
one
right
but
went
there
everybody
wants
to
buy
the
hat
now
they
like
the
white
one
then
two
weeks
later
wore
the
red
one
the
white
one
sell
so
well
the
red
one
sells
crazy
thing
but
went
to
the
border
and
got
to
know
the
people
and
saw
people
and
you
know
rough
stuff
rough
stuff
and
when
first
came
in
and
when
first
did
my
opening
statement
that
was
running
for
president
talked
about
illegal
immigration
was
killed
by
the
press
rush
who
think
is
terrific
guy
said
trump
has
received
more
incoming
than
any
human
being
ever
seen
then
he
goes
and
has
news
conference
and
think
going
to
and
he
doubles
down
got
credit
got
credit
no
they
thought
was
going
to
and
mind
but
have
to
make
mistake
to
and
was
right
no
was
right
so
for
two
weeks
as
rush
said
took
fact
that
was
my
first
two
weeks
said
is
it
going
to
be
like
this
for
the
next
year
and
half
know
if
can
make
it
it
was
brutal
now
many
of
those
people
that
talked
that
way
many
of
those
people
to
me
everybody
says
right
and
only
because
of
me
is
everybody
talking
about
illegal
immigration
they
even
be
talking
about
it
they
even
be
talking
about
it
and
going
to
build
wall
and
going
to
get
you
know
the
gang
members
in
and
in
chicago
and
these
are
some
tough
dudes
going
to
be
out
so
fast
one
of
the
first
thing
going
to
do
is
get
rid
of
those
gang
members
going
to
be
you
know
you
look
at
going
on
with
you
look
at
going
on
in
chicago
and
and
louis
the
other
night
we
are
going
to
get
rid
of
those
gang
members
so
fast
your
head
will
spin
you
know
we
can
be
very
tough
just
met
your
cops
outside
those
police
are
tough
cookies
those
guys
we
need
law
and
order
we
need
law
and
order
mean
they
allowed
in
one
night
that
first
night
in
they
allowed
that
city
to
be
destroyed
and
they
set
it
back
years
one
night
because
the
police
were
not
allowed
to
protect
people
they
allowed
to
protect
people
we
have
incredible
law
enforcement
in
this
country
and
we
have
to
be
the
head
of
the
police
in
chicago
is
person
know
originally
from
new
york
phenomenal
guy
he
can
stop
things
if
allowed
to
stop
them
he
can
stop
it
believe
me
we
have
some
incredible
people
but
we
have
to
be
tough
we
have
to
be
smart
you
know
know
going
to
have
some
bad
apples
going
to
have
problems
see
some
of
the
things
you
did
too
and
disgusting
and
horrible
but
such
tiny
percentage
the
problem
is
the
good
work
get
shown
on
television
all
of
the
good
work
which
is
mean
the
good
work
with
the
police
that
one
little
thing
and
horrible
agree
hated
some
of
the
things
have
to
go
into
them
but
you
know
the
same
ones
because
you
were
sick
when
you
looked
at
some
of
them
just
like
was
but
we
need
law
and
order
we
need
our
police
great
people
they
do
phenomenal
job
right
now
afraid
of
doing
anything
afraid
mean
know
cities
mention
names
but
know
cities
where
police
are
afraid
to
even
talk
to
people
because
they
want
to
be
able
to
retire
and
have
their
pension
they
want
to
be
thrown
off
the
police
force
and
then
you
wonder
why
crimes
in
our
cities
so
we
need
whole
new
mindset
we
have
to
build
up
our
military
we
have
to
make
our
military
so
strong
we
have
to
make
our
military
so
powerful
and
so
strong
that
we
never
have
to
use
it
we
never
have
to
use
it
we
also
have
to
focus
on
what
we
have
look
ukraine
want
ukraine
to
be
healthy
vibrant
and
good
but
ukraine
is
near
germany
and
all
of
these
european
countries
now
sending
the
newest
fighters
the
best
in
the
world
sending
fighters
every
germany
where
are
all
these
european
countries
it
affects
them
it
affects
them
and
we
want
to
stand
alongside
of
them
agree
but
why
are
we
leading
the
fight
hates
us
he
hates
he
hate
us
think
like
me
get
along
great
with
him
think
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
no
he
has
no
respect
for
our
president
and
our
president
like
him
in
all
fairness
they
have
good
chemistry
to
put
it
mildly
would
you
say
but
get
along
with
these
people
think
of
it
every
country
is
ripping
us
off
even
russia
is
ripping
us
off
because
in
the
iran
deal
which
is
going
to
go
down
as
one
of
the
worst
deals
ever
russia
is
big
beneficiary
because
going
to
sell
iran
missiles
with
the
money
we
give
to
iran
think
of
that
so
one
of
the
biggest
beneficiaries
is
russia
okay
but
think
of
it
so
ukraine
take
few
of
these
things
and
then
getting
the
hell
out
of
here
going
back
to
new
york
do
you
mind
maybe
go
to
the
grand
ole
tonight
can
do
that
actually
rather
love
by
the
way
this
is
not
politician
speaking
believe
me
hope
love
country
music
love
it
hey

who
else

on
the
apprentice
who

two
guys

onto
the
apprentice

said
who
the
hell

he
know
who
trace
was
never
heard
of
him
and
he

he
came
on
just
to
show
you
how
important
this
show
is
and
his
record
or
album
or
whatever
you
call
it
went
to
number

and
then
he
came
to
me
the
next
trace
came
to
me
and
he
goes
you
know
at
certain
awards
show

but
he
said
last
year

the
show
and
this
year
hosting
it
trump
all
because
of
you
nice
right
know
nice
but
those
three
guys
great
and
just
fantastic
people
but
got
to
make
our
country
so
strong
we
have
to
make
our
country
rich
again
person
came
up
and
said
oh
not
nice
not
nice
they
said
rich
you
know
to
say
going
to
make
our
country
rich
we
make
our
country
great
if
going
to
be
poor
debtor
nation
we
owe
trillion
china
think
of
this
china
we
owe
trillion
to
so
they
come
in
they
take
our
jobs
they
take
our
money
they
take
our
base
they
take
our
manufacturing
and
we
owe
them
trillion
how
do
you
do
that
like
magic
act
right
true
japan
sells
us
cars
by
the
millions
they
make
fortune
they
come
in
they
sell
us
cars
by
the
millions
and
we
owe
them
the
exact
same
amount
we
owe
them
trillion
how
come
if
selling

we
owe
them
money
think
of
it
put
on
your

stuff
right
you
know
right
if
we
buy
all
these
cars
why
do
we
owe
them

but
we
owe
them
because

all
our
money
that
they
make
and
they
buy
our
bonds
and

interests
on
them

word

thought

of
great
achievement

such
good
care

interesting
friend
of
mine
had
it
good
guy
and
the
banks
were
just
killing
him
they
were
mean
and
banks
can
be
mean
right
got
to
teach
them
how
to
behave
right
so
this
guy
was
just
getting
beaten
and
did
him
and
called
up
the
banks
and
said
do
me
this
do
this
do
this
do
that
they
said
we
do
that
no
we
do
that
said
making
mistake
anyways
sort
of
little
bit
bought
it
immediately
called
them
back
and
said
do
this
threw
it
into
chapter
and
they
come
out
with
the
story
trump
files
bankruptcy
can
you
believe
it
negotiated
it
to
hell
what
did
to
that
bank
they
see
me
walking
down
the
street
and
they
go
hey
hey
hey
but
then
good
at
that
stuff
you
know
really
good
at
that
stuff
but
you
have
to
use
the
laws
to
your
advantage
no
no
you
have
to
use
it
to
your
advantage
atlantic
city
you
know
you
look
at
atlantic
city
went
bankrupt
whoever
heard
of
filed
chapter
nobody
cares
everybody
in
atlantic
city
had
the
good
sense
seven
years
ago
and
actually
the
financial
media
gives
me
great
credit
because
have
vision
for
things
said
go
into
iraq
even
though
very
militaristic
person
said
go
into
iraq
and
they
have
because
said
going
to
the
middle
east
so
what
did
we
get
trillion
thousands
of
deaths
thousands
like
wounded
warriors
who
love
all
over
the
place
we
even
go
there
iran
is
taking
over
iraq
with
the
money
that
giving
them
going
to
take
off
and
going
to
get
the
oil
going
to
get
everything
the
oil
they
get
isis
is
getting
what
do
we
get
nothing
we
get
nothing
we
got
far
less
than
nothing
so
had
vision
in
actually
it
was
before
that
but
they
wrote
story
trump
says
do
iraq
now
much
more
militaristic
than
bush
even
the
brother
but
you
got
to
know
where
to
use
it
and
when
you
got
to
use
so
with
atlantic
city
seven
years
ago
got
out
called
vision
should
get
credit
for
vision
and
again
this
bragging
normally
say
this
but
need
your
votes
do
you
understand
that
do
you
understand
that
mean
normally
so
got
great
credit
got
out
but
most
of
the
places
in
atlantic
city
are
either
in
trouble
or
bankrupt
they
went
bankrupt
but
made
lot
of
money
in
atlantic
city
had
great
time
in
atlantic
city
but
they
asked
me
nasty
question

great
answer

but
hopefully
it
all
work
out
now
as
hopefully
the
next
president
of
the
united
states
want
to
refer
back
to
what
happened
over
the
years
the
middle
east
today
is
more
unstable
than
ever
before
never
been
like
this
out
of
control
after
four
years
of
who
really
led
the
way
and
led
down
horrible
path
because
do
even
think
he
could
have
made
these
decisions
so
badly
she
led
him
right
down
horrible
path
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
iraq
syria
all
into
chaos
and
iran
is
on
path
to
nuclear
weapons
and
on
top
of
that
we
gave
them
back
billion
and
we
did
get
our
hostages
until
the
end
now
we
seeing
unrest
in
turkey
further
demonstration
of
the
failures
of
you
just
have
to
look
every
single
thing
they
touched
has
turned
to
horrible
horrible
problems
we
also
need
to
bring
back
in
this
country
because
we
see
what
happened
our
industry
our
manufacturing
our
jobs
they
been
taken
away
like
we
babies
taken
away
and
we
going
to
bring
them
back
found
the
leader
who
will
help
us
deliver
safe
society
and
prosperous
really
prosperous
society
for
all
americans
indiana
governor
mike
pence
was
my
first
choice
admired
the
work
he
done
especially
in
the
state
of
indiana
and
going
to
go
over
some
of
those
accomplishments
in
just
minute
but
also
admire
the
fact
that
he
fights
for
the
people
and
he
going
to
fight
for
you
he
is
solid
solid
person
governor
pence
served
indiana
with
distinction
in
congress
he
rose
to
leadership
and
served
as
the
chairman
of
the
entire
house
republican
conference
number
one
he
really
got
the
skills
of
highly
talented
executive
leading
the
state
of
indiana
to
jobs
growth
and
opportunity
in
spite
of
the
relentless
obstacles
put
in
his
way
and
every
state
way
by
the
administration
it
horrible
out
there
high
taxes
and
regulations
and
it
out
of
control
mike
pence
is
man
of
character
and
honesty
we
know
that
is
the
embodiment
of
corruption
she
corrupt
person
what
she
done
with
her
what
she
done
with
so
many
things
and
see
the
up
all
the
time
the
she
totally
bought
and
paid
for
by
wall
street
the
special
interests
the
lobbyists
percent
she
crooked
and
think
that
while
she
got
away
with
murder
in
fact
think
it
might
be
her
greatest
accomplishment
escaping
the
recent
scandal
and
her
lies
and
the
loss
of
but
it
was
loss
she
discarded
that
in
itself
is
major
crime
other
people
have
been
paying
tremendous
prices
for
what
they
done
which
is
peanuts
compared
to
what
happened
with
thousand
are
missing
and
that
ok
did
give
them
to
the
did
give
them
to
the
attorney
general
and
that
ok
wipes
her
server
clean
that
ok
these
are
crimes
these
are
crimes
and
how
she
got
away
with
it
think
understand
it
but
think
lot
of
people
do
but
do
believe
while
she
did
pay
the
price
she
should
have
paid
she
going
to
pay
that
price
when
november
rolls
around
she
going
to
pay
it
at
the
polls
believe
that
on
top
of
everything
else
made
million
giving
speeches
to
special
interests
in
short
period
of
time
she
totally
owned
by
wall
street
we
believe
in
she
believes
in
and
it
not
that
she
believes
in
it
the
people
that
give
her
all
of
this
money
believe
in
it
and
she
believe
in
whatever
they
want
her
to
believe
believe
me
that
it
what
difference
between
crooked
and
mike
pence
mike
pence
will
never
be
afraid
to
speak
the
name
of
our
enemy
radical
islam
radical
islamic
terrorism
you
saw
it
the
other
day
with
the
truck
screaming
out
the
window
you
heard
what
he
was
screaming
out
the
window
you
saw
it
in
san
you
saw
it
at
the
world
trade
you
saw
it
in
how
horrible
was
that
you
saw
it
in
paris
you
see
it
all
over
and
is
weak
person
we
are
the
law
and
order
candidates
and
we
the
law
and
order
party
we
going
to
change
things
around
there
going
to
be
respect
again
for
law
and
order
foreign
policy
helped
launch
isis
you
know
she
talking
see
the
she
puts
on
if
make
one
statement
which
is
fine
she
take
that
statement
and
put
on
totally
dishonest
because
she
got
lot
of
money
because
it
given
to
her
by
the
lobbyists
and
by
the
special
interests
got
lot
of
money
but
see
the
on
foreign
policy
she
talking
about
trump
does
have
foreign
policy
experience
of
course
not
been
very
very
very
successful
mean
but
but
if
you
look
at
my
calls
said
do
go
into
iraq
nobody
cared
because
was
was
civilian
take
the
oil
many
many
calls
made
you
take
look
said
that
in
scotland
and
in
the
that
was
going
to
happen
was
the
one
that
predicted
it
and
everybody
said
he
wrong
he
wrong
president
said
if
it
happens
they
going
to
get
to
the
back
of
the
line
which
probably
is
one
of
the
reasons
they
lost
because
consider
it
win
think
it
was
win
for
them
actually
because
they
do
want
to
be
told
what
to
do
and
they
do
want
to
be
told
that
when
people
pour
into
the
country
they
have
to
take
them
even
if
they
not
qualified
even
if
they
do
have
paperwork
even
if
they
have
no
idea
where
they
come
from
and
said
that
going
to
happen
said
that
they
are
going
to
break
away
and
everybody
laughed
at
me
and
the
odds
were
percent
and
then
when
it
happened
she
took
an
saying
oh
trump
said
this
or
that
but
the
one
that
said
it
was
going
to
happen
and
some
of
the
more
fair
reporters
about
percent
of
them
said
he
was
right
appreciate
that
seventy
percent
did
so
that
ok
so
mike
pence
will
never
be
afraid
to
speak
the
name
of
our
enemy
so
important
now
think
if
you
look
at
one
of
the
big
reasons
that
chose
mike
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
party
unity
have
to
be
honest
so
many
people
have
said
party
unity
because
an
outsider
want
to
be
an
outsider
think
it
one
of
the
reasons
won
in
landslides
won
in
landslides
this
was
close
this
was
close
now
this
was
close
this
was
in
the
history
of
the
republican
party
history
with
people
running
you
have
to
understand
other
people
ran
against
one
two
and
three
there
were
we
got
say
we
because
the
messenger
messenger
doing
good
job
but
messenger
we
got
almost
million
votes
that
more
than
any
other
person
in
the
history
of
the
republican
party
in
the
primary
system
running
for
president
think
of
it
that
more
than
who
we
love
that
more
than
nixon
it
more
than
you
know
he
won
the
second
world
war
in
all
fairness
pretty
good
it
more
than
the
bushes
but
mean
by
lot
do
mean
by
little
but
that
with
people
people
do
that
that
means
our
message
is
unbelievable
and
want
to
thank
all
of
the
loyal
people
because
have
such
loyal
unbelievable
people
and
they
displayed
that
just
yesterday
in
where
it
going
to
be
so
amazing
but
they
displayed
it
it
was
on
display
where
we
had
this
group
of
people
who
many
of
whom
known
and
say
because
for
party
unity
say
they
wonderful
people
ok
never
trump
they
said
never
trump
never
trump
oh
we
going
to
win
they
got
crushed
and
they
got
crushed
immediately
because
people
want
what
we
saying
to
happen
they
tired
of
country
that
has
horrible
trade
deals
that
has
no
borders
that
has
taxes
that
are
through
the
roof
highest
taxed
nation
just
about
in
the
world
that
has
regulations
that
do
allow
you
to
start
business
and
destroy
your
business
if
you
do
start
and
by
the
way
speaking
of
destroying
businesses
we
going
to
take
care
of
the
miners
and
we
going
to
take
care
of
the
steelworkers
we
going
to
put
them
back
to
work
so
they
very
tired
of
it
but
want
to
thank
all
of
those
people
that
delegates
that
were
on
the
different
committees
because
boy
was
that
something
did
we
show
them
something
and
unfortunately
the
vote
was
very
late
but
essentially
we
had
this
was
the
vote
that
was
going
to
put
it
onto
the
floor
and
we
going
to
have
big
fight
we
not
going
to
have
fight
people
agree
with
what
we
they
want
the
wall
they
want
the
borders
they
want
these
things
to
happen
and
what
we
doing
and
what
we
doing
that
so
proud
of
so
proud
and
nobody
else
would
even
think
about
doing
it
fought
very
hard
for
it
we
call
it
the
amendment
where
he
took
away
from
the
evangelicals
and
want
to
thank
the
evangelicals
because
without
the
evangelicals
could
not
have
won
this
nomination
the
evangelicals
have
been
unbelievable
dominated
with
the
evangelicals
lot
of
people
were
surprised
they
say
he
not
perfect
but
you
know
what
they
know
going
to
get
the
job
done
and
they
really
smart
and
said
and
said
for
the
evangelicals
that
we
going
to
do
something
that
nobody
even
tried
to
do
you
have
the
amendment
passed
by
and
his
group
and
he
was
powerful
president
he
knew
how
to
get
things
done
he
got
bogged
down
in
war
that
was
disaster
and
it
destroyed
him
but
he
was
powerful
president
and
we
call
it
the
amendment
where
you
are
just
absolutely
shunned
if
you
evangelical
if
you
want
to
talk
religion
you
lose
your
status
we
put
into
the
platform
we
going
to
get
rid
of
that
horrible
amendment
and
we
going
to
let
evangelicals
we
going
to
let
and
jews
and
people
of
religion
talk
without
being
afraid
to
talk
saw
this
had
so
many
great
leaders
so
many
times
up
to
my
office
the
top
the
absolute
top
evangelical
leaders
christian
leaders
jewish
leaders
believe
it
or
not
some
muslim
leaders
people
are
going
to
be
surprised
to
hear
that
had
the
top
leaders
up
to
my
office
and
said
why
is
it
that
you
so
powerful
as
an
individual
and
yet
when
you
get
out
there
you
sort
of
timid
and
they
did
know
how
to
answer
the
question
and
it
took
two
three
meetings
before
figured
it
out
one
great
great
gentleman
that
everybody
knows
but
whose
name
will
not
reveal
said
trump
we
live
in
fear
in
our
churches
and
our
synagogues
we
live
in
fear
that
we
going
to
lose
our
status
if
we
say
anything
that
even
slightly
political
and
looked
out
the
window
was
in
trump
tower
and
pointed
to
people
walking
down
the
street
said
well
they
have
the
right
to
speak
but
you
do
that
means
they
more
powerful
than
you
are
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
how
did
it
start
how
did
it
start
and
they
said
it
started
because
of
and
he
actually
had
problem
in
texas
with
certain
religious
leader
and
he
did
this
and
he
got
it
done
and
we
going
to
undo
it
so
that
religious
leaders
in
this
country
and
those
unbelievable
people
and
not
because
they
backed
me
in
such
large
numbers
but
so
that
religion
can
again
have
voice
because
religion
voice
has
been
taken
away
and
we
going
to
change
that
ok
all
right
back
to
mike
pence
so
one
of
the
primary
reasons
chose
mike
was
looked
at
indiana
and
won
indiana
big
remember
indiana
was
going
to
be
the
that
where
trump
was
going
to
they
agreed
win
new
york
win
win
all
these
places
but
indiana
was
going
to
be
the
so
got
to
study
indiana
and
got
to
study
new
york
and
lot
of
other
places
and
saw
how
signed
by
bill
has
drained
our
manufacturing
jobs
just
drained
us
like
we
never
been
drained
before
again
signed
by
bill
is
the
worst
economic
deal
in
the
history
of
our
country
manufacturing
down
in
some
states
percent
percent
it
horror
show
moving
to
mexico
moving
to
other
places
have
friend
who
great
builder
what
he
builds
is
plants
that
all
he
does
is
build
plants
he
does
build
buildings
he
does
he
builds
plants
it
the
biggest
in
the
world
from
what
hear
said
how
business
was
with
him
the
other
day
how
business
he
goes
unbelievable
said
really
wow
surprised
why
is
it
unbelievable
because
think
of
him
as
building
in
this
country
he
says
what
we
doing
in
mexico
you
believe
said
what
do
you
mean
he
said
we
building
plants
in
mexico
the
likes
of
which
we
never
seen
said
what
about
this
country
not
much
not
much
that
the
expression
he
said
exactly
that
not
much
said
but
mexico
he
said
you
never
seen
anything
like
it
it
incredible
folks
that
going
to
stop
we
going
to
go
reverse
it
we
going
to
bring
our
jobs
back
to
this
country
we
be
the
stupid
people
anymore
ok
and
he
was
better
than
pollster
he
better
than
consultant
would
say
how
are
we
doing
and
you
get
big
report
that
costs
you
millions
of
dollars
does
cost
me
millions
me
give
them
ok
it
costs
other
people
millions
it
costs
other
campaigns
millions
to
get
report
every
time
they
get
report
it
millions
but
tell
you
what
guy
like
this
is
better
than
anybody
you
can
hire
to
do
report
and
he
said
it
he
did
say
it
from
the
standpoint
of
he
upset
about
it
just
fact
how
are
we
doing
unbelievable
in
mexico
in
fact
he
actually
said
never
ever
seen
anything
like
it
and
if
you
look
ford
is
building
massive
plants
there
instead
of
michigan
we
want
them
to
build
them
in
michigan
they
going
to
build
them
in
michigan
and
you
know
that
know
how
to
do
that
so
easy
so
easy
but
they
not
going
to
do
and
they
not
going
to
take
advantage
of
us
without
retribution
there
are
consequences
when
you
fire
thousands
of
people
and
move
to
another
country
and
then
think
you
going
to
you
your
product
and
sell
it
in
here
there
are
consequences
and
those
consequences
are
going
to
keep
companies
in
our
country
it
very
simple
and
everybody
here
knows
what
the
consequences
are
but
say
that
because
much
more
interested
right
now
in
mike
indiana
unemployment
rate
and
this
is
the
primary
reason
wanted
mike
other
than
he
looks
very
good
other
than
he
got
an
incredible
family
incredible
wife
and
family
is
amazing
incredible
family
highly
respected
expected
to
go
for
another
four
years
he
would
have
won
think
very
easily
in
indiana
indiana
their
unemployment
rate
has
fallen
when
he
was
there
when
he
started
percent
when
he
was
governor
when
he
took
over
to
less
than
percent
in
may
of
since
january
indiana
force
has
increased
by
more
than
jobs
you
have
to
understand
gone
around
to
all
these
states
gone
to
all
of
them
and
every
time
have
statisticians
say
give
me
the
on
state
and
it
always
bad
down
down
down
down
percent
percent
percent
in
some
cases
here
somebody
where
it
gone
up
private
sector
job
growth
is
up
by
more
than
jobs
since
that
like
very
unusual
governor
pence
balanced
the
budget
can
you
imagine
balanced
budget
our
budget
so
out
of
whack
in
this
country
we
do
know
what
we
doing
we
going
to
owe
very
soon
trillion
he
balanced
the
budget
they
do
know
what
that
means
governor
pence
balanced
the
budget
produced
surplus
and
maintains
billion
reserve
fund
in
the
state
of
indiana
it
also
rated
their
bonds
are
rated
very
few
states
have
that
the
best
that
as
good
as
you
can
get
whether
you
company
state
indiana
was
recently
by
chief
executive
magazine
as
the
state
in
the
for
business
number
one
and
it
not
even
close
there
are
approximately
fewer
on
unemployment
insurance
now
than
there
were
when
mike
pence
took
office
so
you
have
fewer
fewer
people
from
indiana
and
besides
that
bobby
knight
my
friend
who
really
did
help
me
mean
if
you
want
reference
bobby
knight
in
indiana
we
love
bobby
knight
but
he
agrees
with
everything
saying
he
loves
the
governor
indiana
has
the
unemployment
rate
in
the
nation
for
veterans
where
nobody
fighting
for
the
veterans
like
fighting
for
the
veterans
the
veterans
have
been
left
behind
if
you
remember
few
months
ago
said
really
they
doing
much
better
the
is
much
better
they
doing
much
better
job
than
people
give
it
credit
for
people
are
dying
on
line
waiting
for
five
six
days
for
doctors
people
are
dying
on
they
even
see
doctor
it
scandal
take
look
at
what
happening
with
the
in
arizona
take
look
at
what
happening
with
you
know
just
the
veterans
administration
hospitals
it
scandal
it
corrupt
it
incompetent
it
scandal
and
thought
it
was
just
fine
and
boy
am
going
to
win
big
with
the
veterans
mean
we
know
that
for
fact
so
it
now
percent
for
veterans
in
when
mike
pence
took
office
the
rate
for
veterans
was
percent
it
was
in
the
nation
one
of
the
bad
ones
and
now
it
almost
the
best
got
them
jobs
got
them
jobs
is
ranked
second
in
top
metro
areas
for
young
college
graduates
that
great
thing
they
going
to
stay
there
that
great
thing
and
mike
worked
hard
on
that
he
was
telling
me
that
was
not
easy
under
governor
pence
leadership
indiana
enacted
the
largest
education
funding
increase
in
the
state
history
so
you
balancing
budgets
and
yet
you
giving
more
money
to
education
is
that
great
thing
indiana
has
just
about
the
largest
school
choice
program
in
america
school
choice
is
where
it
at
folks
you
want
to
get
your
schools
better
you
better
get
rid
of
common
core
fast
governor
pence
enacted
the
largest
income
tax
cut
in
the
state
history
think
of
that
we
cutting
taxes
and
balancing
budgets
and
along
with
corporate
tax
reform
just
about
number
one
in
the
country
ranked
indiana
first
in
the
nation
for
its
infrastructure
so
with
all
of
these
cuts
and
all
of
these
balancing
budgets
we
spending
more
money
on
education
and
the
infrastructure
is
kept
up
that
had
so
much
look
as
builder
nobody
in
the
history
of
this
country
has
ever
known
so
much
about
infrastructure
as
trump
build
infrastructure
do
know
how
to
build
wall
do
know
how
to
build
infrastructure
you
know
it
very
interesting
we
building
we
building
won
the
which
is
pretty
amazing
with
the
administration
but
won
the
right
to
have
the
old
post
office
building
on
avenue
right
near
the
white
house
and
it
an
amazing
probably
the
best
location
one
of
the
most
sought
after
projects
in
the
history
of
the
general
services
and
really
like
what
happened
we
going
to
have
an
opening
very
soon
and
and
don
did
fantastic
job
on
it
but
thought
the
other
day
was
going
over
the
numbers
we
under
budget
and
about
year
actually
more
than
year
we
year
ahead
of
schedule
and
we
under
budget
substantially
and
the
quality
of
the
work
is
even
better
than
we
originally
were
going
to
do
and
when
explained
to
government
representative
that
we
under
budget
and
ahead
of
schedule
they
almost
fell
off
because
they
never
heard
those
words
before
they
never
heard
them
so
when
see
what
happened
to
indiana
which
was
having
tremendous
problems
when
see
what
happened
to
indiana
under
mike
work
also
his
predecessor
did
great
job
by
the
way
great
job
who
now
at
duke
who
now
at
when
see
what
happened
with
respect
to
the
numbers
the
state
and
everything
else
that
to
me
was
probably
the
single
most
important
point
because
it
something
that
has
happened
almost
has
not
happened
in
this
whole
country
the
turnaround
and
the
strength
of
indiana
has
been
incredible
and
learned
that
when
campaigned
there
and
learned
that
when
won
that
state
in
landslide
and
learned
that
when
governor
pence
under
tremendous
pressure
from
establishment
people
endorsed
somebody
else
but
it
was
more
of
an
endorsement
for
me
if
you
remember
he
talked
about
trump
then
he
talked
about
ted
who
good
guy
by
the
way
who
going
to
be
speaking
at
the
convention
ted
good
guy
but
he
talked
about
trump
ted
then
he
went
back
to
trump
said
who
did
he
endorse
so
even
though
he
was
under
pressure
because
so
you
know
outside
of
the
establishment
it
was
the
single
greatest
endorsement
ever
had
in
my
life
ok
will
tell
you
so
with
that
would
like
to
introduce
man
who
truly
believe
will
be
outstanding
in
every
way
and
will
be
the
next
vice
president
of
the
united
states
governor
mike
pence
thank
you
thank
you
everybody
thank
you

so
just
want
to
thank
all
of
the
people
of
indiana
you
know
we
had
great
victory
here
not
so
long
ago
and
indiana
was
the
state
that
put
me
over
the
top
thank
you
folks
thank
you
cheering
well
we
have
lot
of
things
to
discuss
but
we
had
some
very
bad
news
few
days
ago
and
you
saw
what
happened
lot
of
bad
things
are
happening
and
was
going
to
go
through
whole
litany
of
that
but
we
do
want
to
we
want
to
be
upbeat
we
want
to
be
positive
we
want
to
be
strong
and
we
going
to
be
strong

going
to
be
stronger
than
ever
before

going
to
be
greater
than
ever
before
we
going
to
bring
our
jobs
back
we
going
bring
our
military
back
it
being
depleted
so
badly
we
going
to
take
care
of
our
veterans
which
we
have
to
take
care
of
we
going
to
get
rid
of
which
is
disaster
cheering
and
replace
it
with
something
terrific
we
end
common
core
we
bring
our
education
back
to
the
local
communities
like
this
local
community
where
the
people
love
their
children
and
they
want
to
see
their
children
be
well
educated
it
so
important
we
going
to
save
our
second
amendment
we
going
to
save
our
second
amendment
and
it
under
siege
you
know
wrote
few
words
today
and
think
it
important
that
we
go
through
it
as
group
it
been
special
place
and
you
special
people
and
know
so
many
people
tonight
in
the
audience
and
you
all
over
look
at
all
those
cameras
up
there
folks
look
at
all
those
cameras
they
do
stop
they
do
stop
but
just
wanted
to
say
wrote
this
quickly
but
it
means
it
came
right
from
the
heart
and
have
to
say
that
our
whole
nation
grieves
and
mourns
for
the
loss
of
five
in
dallas
law
enforcement
these
were
great
great
people
great
people
applause
we
pray
for
their
families
we
pray
for
their
loved
ones
we
pray
for
all
the
wounded
survivors
we
pray
for
our
country
it
so
important
the
police
are
not
just
part
of
our
society
our
police
are
the
best
of
our
society
remember
that
we
have
to
remember
that
they
represent
our
highest
ideals
our
greatest
values
and
our
most
noble
characteristics
when
our
police
are
attacked
our
entire
nation
is
attacked
remember
that
remember
that
so
the
message
must
be
delivered
clearly
for
all
to
hear
the
hostility
against
our
police
has
to
end
and
it
has
to
end
right
now
and
we
have
to
say
together
and
we
have
to
be
strong
we
have
to
take
care
of
everyone
the
two
people
that
were
killed
in
and
it
was
tough
it
was
tough
to
watch
for
everybody
here
it
was
tough
to
watch
we
have
to
figure
it
out
we
have
to
figure
out
what
is
going
on
was
it
training
was
it
something
else
it
could
have
been
something
else
we
have
to
take
care
of
everybody
remember
that
but
we
have
to
also
we
have
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
things
we
have
to
but
we
can
never
ever
forget
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
great
deals
and
great
things
that
our
police
all
over
the
country
do
and
nobody
them
for
what
they
do
and
when
there
is
problem
as
bad
as
these
two
situations
were
and
personally
think
they
were
they
were
bad
hated
hated
watching
it
but
as
bad
as
they
were
they
get
broadcast
all
over
the
world
for
days
and
days
and
all
of
the
good
things
which
are
magnified
thousands
of
times
nobody
talks
about
so
we
have
to
remember
we
have
to
cherish
and
take
care
of
our
police
if
we
do
if
we
do
we
do
have
country
anymore
we
have
country
in
chaos
and
remember
this
and
say
it
once
and
say
it
with
love
and
say
it
with
compassion
because
have
love
for
our
country
and
have
great
compassion
for
our
people
in
our
country
but
am
the
law
and
order
candidate
we
need
law
and
order
and
we
need
strength
in
this
country
we
do
have
strength
in
our
country
we
have
crooked
as
crooked
as
you
get
mean
you
saw
that
with
the
it
rigged
system
folks
it
rigged
system
just
remember
it
it
rigged
system
it
rigged
in
so
many
different
ways
we
going
to
straighten
it
out
you
even
watch
what
happens
we
had
young
man
who
did
nothing
by
comparison
to
what
she
did
and
he
warned
his
friends
of
problem
that
was
coming
militarily
and
they
came
down
on
him
with
vengeance
and
they
let
her
go
missing
they
let
her
go
lies
all
over
the
place
and
they
let
her
go
think
of
it
it
disgrace
so
we
going
to
get
on
to
other
subjects
but
have
to
say
law
enforcement
has
to
remain
with
us
we
have
to
take
care
of
our
police
and
our
law
enforcement
officials
we
going
to
do
it
we
going
to
continue
to
do
it
we
going
remember
that
they
do
fabulous
job
we
going
to
remember
that
they
do
great
job
and
every
once
in
while
problems
will
happen
and
we
going
take
care
of
those
problems
and
they
can
be
bad
problems
but
we
are
going
to
treat
our
police
with
respect
remember
that
okay
now
looking
at
different
rates
and
different
crimes
and
you
see
the
crime
rate
in
large
portions
of
our
country
is
going
way
up
you
look
at
certain
inner
cities
and
look
at
chicago
look
at
what
is
going
on
since
president
became
president
almost
killings
in
chicago
and
nobody
talks
about
it
well
we
going
to
start
talking
about
it
because
we
have
to
make
this
safe
country
and
you
know
would
say
two
weeks
ago
month
ago
would
be
saying
these
words

talking
about
the
border

talking
about
the
wall
and
we
will
build
the
wall

going
to

would
believe

and
billions
of
dollars

on
the
border

losing
on
trade
and
when
was
in
the
debates
and
mentioned
this
people
would
come
up
that
was
debating
against

they
used
to
say
you
not
really
going
to
build
wall
are
you
say
absolutely
they
say
but
you
build
wall
but
in
the
construction
you
know
how
easy
wall
is
wall
we
build
buildings
with
bathrooms
that
tough
construction
not
wall
walls
do
have
bathrooms
and
bathrooms
are
always
tough
but
we
going
to
have
very
big
beautiful
gate
in
that
wall
big
and
beautiful
and
that
gate
is
going
to
be
open
and
it
going
to
be
wide
open
for
people
to
come
into
our
country
but
they
going
to
come
into
our
country
legally
they
going
to
come
in
legally
and
there
are
going
to
be
people
that
love
our
country
they
not
going
to
be
people
that
hate
our
country
they
not
going
to
be
people
that
we
do
know
where
they
come
from
they
not
going
to
be
people
that
come
from
the
migration
that
do
have
paperwork
that
do
have
passports
that
we
have
no
idea
where
they
from
we
have
no
idea
what
their
motives
are
we
going
to
say
no
sorry
no
and
we
help
and
in
syria
we
build
safe
zones
and
we
get
other
people
to
put
up
the
money
because
we
going
to
owe
very
soon
trillion
trillion
with
nobody
even
knows
what
it
means
we
going
to
owe
right
now
can
you
believe
this
trillion
soon
going
to
trillion
so
we
going
get
the
gulf
states
who
have
so
much
money
folks
so
much
money
and
we
going
to
get
them
to
put
up
the
money
and
others
and
we
going
to
take
care
of
people
and
we
going
have
compassion
but
we
allow
them
to
come
into
our
country
we
have
enough
problems
right
now
you
see
what
happened
in
you
see
what
happened
in
san
we
allow
it
to
happen
so
we
going
to
build
safe
zones
we
going
take
care
of
people
we
going
to
have
other
people
fund
these
safe
zones
we
going
to
build
up
our
military
we
should
have
never
been
in
iraq
but
once
we
went
into
iraq
we
should
have
never
left
the
way
we
left
we
left
like
fools
we
went
in
should
have
never
happened
did
want
to
go
from
the
beginning
and
have
proof
from
the
beginning
did
want
iraq
said
you
going
to
the
entire
middle
east
and
that
exactly
what
happened
but
then
we
were
there
losing
thousands
of
lives
spending
trillions
and
trillions
of
dollars
probably
in
the
middle
east
we
up
to
trillion
and
we
in
worse
shape
now
than
we
were
years
ago
before
the
whole
deal
started
far
worse
not
even
close
far
worse
far
worse
so
what
we
going
to
do
is
we
going
to
start
thinking
smart
we
going
to
be
smart
again
we
going
to
make
great
military
and
by
the
way
said
for
years
we
got
to
keep
the
oil
said
keep
the
oil
you
leave
you
keep
the
oil
we
did
do
it
we
did
do
it
said
it
for
years
once
we
were
in
said
when
we
get
out
it
going
to
be
disaster
but
when
we
get
out
we
should
have
left
some
troops
there
and
hate
saying
that
but
we
should
have
left
some
troops
there
and
it
would
have
been
better
certainly
than
it
is
right
now
be
any
worse
but
always
said
keep
the
oil
but
we
did
keep
the
oil
so
who
has
the
oil
right
now
lot
of
the
oil
is
had
by
isis
and
we
created
isis
and
through
her
incompetence
directly
and
indirectly
created
isis
and
now
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
it
she
says
yes
we
will
fight
isis
she
is
the
one
that
created
it
with
stupidity
with
stupid
stupid
policy
policy
that
only
going
to
get
worse
she
is
the
one
that
created
it
and
that
what
happened
and
so
now
we
have
problems
all
over
the
place
we
have
our
cities
exploding
we
have
isis
looking
at
us
and
by
the
way
when
our
enemies
all
over
the
world
including
our
friends
all
over
the
world
look
at
what
happening
to
our
country
where
the
other
night
you
had
think
of
it
cities
potentially
in
blowup
stage
marches
all
over
the
united
states
and
tough
marches
anger
hatred
hatred
started
by
maniac
that
some
people
asked
for
moment
of
silence
for
him
for
the
killer
for
the
killer
okay
so
when
our
enemies
look
at
what
is
going
on
with
our
country
they
see
our
deficits
they
see
we
do
win
anymore
we
do
win
we
do
win
we
do
win
at
anything
always
say
when
was
going
when
was
young
going
to
high
school
and
going
to
college
and
before
that
we
never
lost
you
know
united
states
they
said
had
never
lost
war
now
we
never
win
we
do
win
on
trade
we
do
win
with
our
military
our
military
is
so
depleted
our
military
has
fighter
jets
that
are
in
use
flown
by
great
great
american
people
that
are
so
old
and
they
get
parts
for
the
fighter
jets
these
are
people
flying
these
jets
now
in
combat
they
get
parts
so
they
go
to
the
plane
graveyards
in
the
deserts
they
go
to
museums
where
they
have
similar
planes
and
they
strip
apart
to
use
for
our
fighter
pilots
to
fly
this
is
what
we
been
reduced
to
and
tell
you
something
is
incompetent
okay
the
greatest
single
thing
in
my
opinion
that
she
ever
done
is
to
get
out
of
the
problem
think
it
is
incredible
she
did
great
job
on
that
think
it
is
her
greatest
achievement
think
when
they
look
back
on
they
will
say
the
greatest
achievement
of
was
getting
out
of
this
problem
with
could
have
gotten
out
she
was
so
guilty
have
list
look
page
after
page
of
the
lies
page
after
page
of
the
lies
all
over
look
at
this
page
page
look
do
want
to
read
it
to
you
the
press
would
say
you
should
spend
your
entire
talking
about
and
the
do
want
to
talk
about
it
you
know
what
it
was
all
lies
folks
do
have
to
go
through
and
bore
everybody
it
was
so
horrible
it
was
so
disgusting
it
was
so
outrageous
you
look
at
general
and
look
at
what
happened
to
him
for
tiny
fraction
of
what
crooked
did
you
look
at
other
people
for
tiny
fraction
look
at
what
happened
to
them
so
just
tell
you
this
we
have
candidate
on
the
other
side
who
if
she
ever
gets
elected
it
will
be
four
more
disgusting
years
of
it
will
be
four
more
years
of
weakness
it
will
be
four
more
years
of
civil
unrest
it
will
be
four
more
years
of
not
winning
with
our
military
and
not
winning
against
isis
they
do
have
clue
how
to
beat
isis
they
do
have
clue
but
it
will
be
four
more
years
of
and
care
and
all
of
these
things
that
do
work
except
think
actually
it
will
be
worse
today
see
gave
her
this
very
you
know
sort
of
strange
endorsement
want
to
tell
you
lot
of
people
are
so
upset
about
it
they
are
going
to
be
voting
for
trump
really
believe
that
they
going
to
be
voting
for
trump
they
are
going
to
be
voting
for
trump
because
the
one
thing
that
and
have
in
common
was
trade
now
he
do
anything
about
it
he
just
knew
it
was
bad
know
how
to
fix
it
because
am
in
of
free
trade
lot
of
people
say
an
isolationist
when
you
lose
billion
year
on
trade
deficits
maybe
that
is
not
the
worse
thing
but
we
straight
it
out
believe
in
open
borders
for
trade
and
free
trade
the
problem
we
have
is
that
virtually
every
single
country
that
deals
with
us
are
far
sharper
and
far
better
they
have
their
best
negotiators
we
have
people
that
are
political
hacks
negotiating
for
us
and
people
that
do
know
what
they
doing
have
the
greatest
businessmen
in
the
world
that
have
endorsed
me
including
people
like
great
businessman
we
have
some
of
the
greatest
negotiators
maybe
the
greatest
in
the
world
and
we
do
use
them
we
use
political
hacks
we
have
people
in
there
that
got
in
for
politics
you
could
look
at
the
biggest
companies
in
the
world
and
it
is
small
it
is
peanuts
compared
to
some
of
the
massive
trade
deals
and
we
have
people
that
should
never
be
negotiating
trade
deals
just
like
we
have
secretary
of
state
negotiating
with
iran
and
what
they
did
to
him
and
you
because
he
has
no
idea
what
the
hell
he
was
doing
and
what
he
gave
away
israel
is
in
serious
jeopardy
frankly
we
in
serious
jeopardy
and
we
made
power
out
of
iran
we
made
power
number
one
we
should
have
never
gone
in
and
negotiated
that
deal
until
we
got
our
hostages
back
ever
ever
we
should
have
never
ever
gone
in
and
what
you
say
is
folks
we
have
to
get
them
back
and
if
you
do
want
to
give
them
back
you
leave
the
meeting
you
leave
the
meeting
and
you
double
up
your
sanctions
you
would
have
had
them
back
within
hours
guarantee
you
that
but
we
do
that
kept
waiting
for
the
whole
delegation
kept
waiting
for
them
to
leave
to
get
up
and
leave
used
to
say
get
up
and
leave
perfect
get
up
we
did
win
anything
the
only
time
that
left
was
at
years
old
to
go
into
bicycle
lace
where
he
fell
and
broke
his
leg
right
and
always
tell
people
promise
you
will
never
enter
bicycle
race
when
in
the
midst
of
an
important
nuclear
negotiation
promise
promise
but
when
you
look
at
it
number
one
we
should
have
gotten
them
back
and
the
other
thing
we
should
have
never
given
them
back
the
billion
and
would
have
said
very
nicely
my
father
used
to
think
was
little
bit
rough
and
he
used
to
go
easy
son
son
take
it
nice
and
easy
you
have
to
take
the
lumps
out
he
had
an
expression
good
father
we
all
have
great
fathers
hope
had
good
father
but
learned
lot
he
said
and
he
would
go
like
this
the
lumps
out
take
the
lumps
easy
nice
and
easy
take
the
lumps
out
you
little
too
rough
what
do
you
mean
pop
you
little
too
rough
and
over
the
years
think
learned
that
made
great
deals
and
built
great
company
great
company
took
advantage
of
every
single
thing
you
can
because
you
are
working
for
yourself
and
families
and
your
employees
and
took
advantage
of
the
laws
some
of
the
laws
are
the
dumbest
laws
ever
seen
and
so
stupid
but
you
take
advantage
of
them
you
like
business
person
right
got
to
take
advantage
of
them
because
you
are
really
representing
your
employees
your
company
and
your
family
but
my
father
would
say
take
the
lumps
out
so
here
is
what
would
have
said
on
the
in
the
old
days
when
young
would
say
we
not
paying
you
back
the
billion
you
not
getting
it
and
there
could
be
lot
of
hard
feeling
in
the
room
take
while
they
will
still
come
back
do
worry
about
it
because
they
need
us
they
need
us
and
then
would
have
left
and
here
go
the
sanctions
would
have
done
two
things
number
one
hostages
before
we
utter
the
first
word
and
number
two
and
how
long
were
the
hostages
there
that
negotiation
took
forever
and
we
did
win
point
we
lost
everything
they
going
to
be
nuclear
power
and
they
are
rich
and
powerful
how
about
yemen
they
are
fighting
on
the
other
side
of
yemen
and
they
fighting
and
wee
fighting
why
did
they
make
the
deal
to
get
out
of
yemen
and
said
because
he
did
want
to
come
ate
complicate
the
negotiations
they
do
want
to
bring
something
else
to
complicate
it
these
are
amateurs
but
my
father
would
say
take
the
lumps
out
so
here
is
what
would
say
we
would
be
negotiating
because
our
prisoners
would
have
been
back
years
ago
would
have
said
look
here
is
the
story
we
have
problem
our
country
is
flat
broke
we
owe
trillion
and
going
to
be
trillion
or
trillion
with
the
omnibus
very
soon
want
to
give
you
the
money
back
really
do
we
do
have
it
sorry
they
would
have
gone
nuts
they
would
have
said
what
do
you
mean
you
have
to
give
us
no
no
we
want
to
we
do
have
it
want
to
so
badly
we
love
you
you
such
great
people
such
nice
people
so
kind
take
look
at
what
they
do
to
their
hostage
and
prisoners
and
you
find
out
about
tough
people
great
negotiators
great
negotiators
would
have
said
remember
nice
and
easy
would
have
rather
done
it
my
way
but
respected
my
father
so
would
have
said
we
do
have
the
money
do
it
they
would
have
left
and
we
would
have
left
and
we
would
have
been
back
in
two
weeks
we
would
have
saved
billion
so
those
two
things
we
would
have
had
our
hostages
back
and
saved
billion
now
they
are
so
rich
they
are
buying
airliners
they
are
buying
everything
they
are
buying
probably
nuclear
weapons
we
just
do
know
about
it
okay
what
the
hell
do
you
have
to
nuclear
weapons
we
worried
about
them
making
nuclear
weapons
they
buy
them
they
have
the
money
they
made
such
fools
out
of
us
folks
those
days
are
over
they
over
they
over
call
the
president
so
we
have
trader
named
sergeant
so
sergeant
thinks
he
likes
their
way
of
life
obviously
oh
they
have
wonderful
way
of
life
so
one
day
he
leaves
we
lose
five
and
maybe
six
but
five
at
least
people
looking
for
him
they
were
killed
they
were
killed
by
the
enemy
they
go
out
there
looking
for
him
they
knew
he
left
everybody
with
him
knew
he
left
because
he
was
all
whacked
out
and
believer
in
them
not
us
so
they
knew
he
left
so
knowing
that
the
fact
they
have
colonel
and
believe
general
talking
to
the
people
that
knew
him
and
they
told
the
colonel
and
the
general
that
he
left
he
deserted
remember
the
old
day
deserter
what
happened
bang
years
ago
it
was
bang
but
slowly
ten
years
ago
it
was
long
prison
today
they
are
probably
talking
about
nothing
that
is
where
we
come
but
call
him
the
so
we
get
right
trader
and
they
get
five
of
the
most
vicious
killers
that
they
have
that
they
been
after
for
nine
years
to
get
them
out
and
they
bring
them
and
they
are
back
on
the
battlefield
trying
to
kill
everybody
including
us
this
stuff
has
got
to
stop
folks
and
we
not
closing
we
going
to
fill
it
up
we
not
closing
we
not
closing
and
see
said
do
not
like
trump
tone
look
here
is
the
story
think
have
great
temperament
she
uses
the
word
temperament
but
love
when
she
uses
the
word
tone
they
are
chopping
heads
off
of
and
everybody
else
we
have
seen
that
since
medieval
times
you
read
the
history
books
they
chopped
off
heads
well
they
are
chopping
off
heads
they
are
drowning
people
in
steel
cages
by
the
dozens
at
time
and
she
says
we
do
like
his
tone
let
me
tell
you
folks
it
is
time
for
tough
tone
we
had
enough
we
had
enough
we
had
enough
we
had
enough
so
we
going
to
do
things
the
smart
way
remember
during
the
debate
they
asked
one
of
the
folks
on
the
debut
stage
who
is
becoming
friendlier
and
friendlier
by
the
day
with
me
which
some
of
the
people
are
recovering
it
was
tell
you
what
they
say
it
was
the
nastiest
primary
that
anybody
has
seen
they
say
the
nastiest
in
recorded
history
who
knew
what
went
on
before
recorded
but
it
was
pretty
nasty
and
some
of
the
folks
saw
one
yesterday
will
not
even
mention
names
because
want
to
be
friends
with
everybody
right
want
to
be
friends
with
them
except
for
the
real
enemy
but
they
sign
document
all
right
it
is
called
pledge
pledge
pledge
swear
pledge
that
if
do
make
it
going
to
support
the
nominee
of
the
party
it
does
say
subject
to
change
subject
to
the
weather
subject
to
the
sun
does
come
up
no
it
said
pledge
and
for
that
pledge
they
got
access
to
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
material
from
the
republican
national
committee
the
doing
great
job
and
if
he
does
tell
you
and
if
he
does
over
the
next
four
or
five
weeks
tell
you
but
they
got
access
so
they
signed
pledge
they
will
support
do
want
their
support
it
mean
one
vote
than
perhaps
their
family
it
does
mean
anything
but
signed
the
pledge
too
and
everybody
wanted
to
sign
the
pledge
and
the
reason
they
signed
the
pledge
was
to
get
me
to
sign
it
signed
it
would
have
it
said
people
should
pledges
people
should
documents
when
they
sign
them
you
know
not
big
deal
not
big
deal
but
they
should
them
so
here
is
the
story
folks
we
losing
our
country
we
like
piece
of
swiss
cheese
at
the
borders
that
is
going
to
end
that
going
to
end
you
know
the
border
patrol
agents
first
time
in
history
they
done
this
they
never
done
this
before
border
patrol
agents
have
endorsed
trump
they
know
better
than
anybody
what
is
going
on
at
the
border
and
by
the
way
if
and
when
we
win
it
is
we
just
messenger
folks
telling
message
of
common
strength
but
just
your
messenger
and
doing
good
job
as
in
all
fairness
but
border
patrol
agents
endorsed
trump
and
what
they
do
now
is
stand
there
with
beautiful
equipment
great
people
people
walk
right
by
them
that
is
an
easy
job
they
stand
it
because
they
do
like
what
is
coming
into
our
country
they
want
to
do
their
job
with
me
they
going
to
be
working
really
hard
and
said
to
them
when
they
called
me
to
tell
me
about
the
endorsement
never
done
it
before
they
never
endorsed
presidential
candidate
before
great
great
people
and
said
to
them
so
let
me
tell
you
want
to
ask
you
this
question
how
important
is
the
wall
they
said
trump
the
wall
is
vital
do
know
what
would
have
done
if
they
said
it
is
not
important
would
have
said
guess
we
not
building
it
because
respect
these
people
they
know
better
than
anybody
they
know
hell
of
lot
of
better
than
consultants
and
people
making
millions
of
dollars
that
do
have
clue
who
is
better
at
that
said
how
important
is
the
wall
trump
never
forget
the
answer
the
wall
is
vital
it
is
vital
very
important
very
important
they
actually
said
it
is
tool
toward
real
security
an
important
tool
and
then
spoke
with
sheriff
from
arizona
and
he
called
me
out
of
the
blue
and
read
about
sheriff
mean
he
knows
borders
right
amazing
guy
tough
guy
but
he
an
amazing
guy
and
he
said
trump
just
want
to
you
know
that
endorsing
you
because
you
know
more
about
this
stuff
than
anybody
you
know
more
about
this
stuff
than
people
doing
it
for
years
you
get
it
you
know
what
is
happening
endorsing
you
and
he
actually
quality
person
he
tough
guy
but
he
quality
person
he
gets
the
job
done
amazing
so
know
about
that
and
when
it
was
coming
time
for
the
wall
never
forget
fox
on
one
of
the
major
networks
used
the
remember
and
told
this
story
couple
of
times
he
said
we
will
not
pay
for
the
wall
and
said
oh
he
dead
can
you
imagine
headlines
tomorrow
he
used
it
on
live
television
and
said
oh
feel
so
badly
for
the
guy
and
now
in
one
way
was
happy
because
he
used
to
say
we
never
build
the
wall
now
he
saying
we
never
pay
for
the
wall
so
we
made
progress
add
least
he
now
admitting
it
is
going
to
get
built
right
and
he
seems
like
nice
guy
but
he
got
little
bit
rough
we
will
never
pay
for
the
wall
said
oh
the
poor
guy
he
is
going
to
get
killed
in
the
papers
nobody
mentioned
it
can
you
imagine
if
threw
out
the
think
it
will
be
the
electric
chair
right
would
it
be
the
electric
chair
and
the
press
will
tell
you
the
people
back
there
and
will
tell
you
this
not
all
of
them
but
many
of
them
are
the
most
dishonest
human
beings
on
the
earth
they
are
the
most
dishonest
human
beings
on
earth
had
days
that
are
so
good
and
then
you
wake
up
the
next
morning
and
you
say
man
did
they
take
that
even
say
what
things
could
go
one
after
another
and
we
do
make
lot
of
mistakes
all
of
us
we
do
make
mistakes
but
what
they
do
is
take
sentence
and
make
it
much
different
than
what
you
said
much
different
from
what
you
meant
and
all
of
sudden
they
say
trump
had
bad
week
because
he
said
something
perfect
perfect
okay
perfect
telling
you
folks
and
tell
it
all
of
the
time
because
as
republican
and
as
republican
conservative
we
are
at
tremendous
disadvantage
you
look
at
the
way
they
treat
crooked
you
take
look
at
this
compared
to
the
way
they
treat
other
people
or
the
way
they
treat
me
they
are
some
of
the
worst
human
beings
on
earth
really
mean
it
really
mean
it
you
know
where
are
my
protests
want
some
protesters
you
know
look
at
this
room
the
governor
just
said
he
never
seen
room
like
this
in
indiana
with
this
many
people
he
never
seen
anything
like
it
look
at
this
thing
this
is
where
your
football
team
look
at
the
ceilings
everything
is
night
always
talk
about
the
wall
is
going
to
be
really
high
but
that
is
really
high
up
there
that
is
big
one
but
you
do
see
crowds
like
this
we
have
crowds
like
this
everywhere
no
matter
where
we
go
and
every
time
go
home
and
my
wife
says
how
was
the
crowd
and
always
say
did
you
see
it
they
keep
those
cameras
on
my
face
they
never
take
the
cameras
off
my
face
because
they
do
want
people
wish
they
would
turn
the
cameras
over
here
take
look
at
this
crowd
take
look
at
this
crowd
look
the
cameras
are
moving
they
are
really
dishonest
really
mean
this
they
are
so
dishonest
that
is
why
love
my
protesters
because
the
only
time
they
move
the
cameras
are
when
we
have
protest
if
somebody
were
up
there
screaming
or
shouting
the
cameras
which
used
to
think
were
in
fixed
position
said
maybe
mechanically
they
move
but
when
we
have
protester
they
turn
and
they
are
like
all
over
the
place
through
the
cameraman
legs
up
around
his
ankles
you
never
saw
cameras
move
like
this
the
fact
is
that
you
have
to
know
what
you
getting
and
the
system
is
wonderful
in
many
ways
but
really
bad
in
others
and
one
of
the
worst
aspects
of
our
system
is
the
dishonest
press
the
dishonest
media
is
one
of
the
worst
things
really
mean
it
they
write
and
say
things
that
are
disgraceful
so
and
like
to
say
you
know
what
when
people
see
or
read
or
hear
things
they
say
tell
you
what
one
of
the
most
incredible
people
say
what
have
you
learned
said
you
know
what
learned
is
how
smart
the
people
are
because
their
rating
is
so
low
they
are
so
thought
of
so
badly
it
is
like
how
smart
the
people
were
and
say
this
various
anchors
some
of
whom
truly
dislike
trump
have
said
what
has
happened
to
us
to
us
the
messenger
you
the
important
ones
in
this
whole
thing
but
what
happened
to
us
is
one
of
the
greatest
political
they
ever
seen
in
the
history
of
the
country
did
even
know
that
did
even
know
that
bill
of
course
on
his
show
tonight
so
if
you
get
home
you
will
see
the
second
edition
but
bill
said
the
single
greatest
political
phenomenon
that
he
seen
in
his
lifetime
now
he
pro
smart
guy
and
tough
tough
but
the
single
greatest
political
phenomenon
that
he
seen
in
his
lifetime
is
trump
and
all
of
us
the
whole
thing
we
been
on
the
cover
we
been
on
the
cover
of
time
magazine
so
much
that
it
becomes
routine
in
fact
they
just
told
me
trump
sir
you
on
the
cover
of
time
magazine
again
this
week
said
all
right
in
the
old
days
would
say
that
is
big
deal
and
now
it
is
like
really
that
is
good
that
is
all
right
you
on
the
cover
of
time
magazine
not
on
the
cover
of
time
magazine
you
on
the
cover
just
remember
that
so
we
have
lot
of
things
that
are
taking
place
we
have
we
have
an
enemy
that
is
dishonest
and
press
that
is
dishonest
we
have
group
of
people
that
want
to
get
elected
who
have
rigged
system
and
who
have
really
rigged
the
system
to
large
extent
they
really
rigged
the
system
say
what
you
want
about
but
the
that
was
worse
than
what
happened
with
us
and
frankly
the
only
reason
could
win
is
we
won
in
such
landslides
all
over
the
place
including
in
indiana
what
landslide
that
was
and
we
love
bobby
knight
do
we
love
bobby
knight
oh
that
bobby
knight
love
my
bobby
knight
we
had
so
many
coaches
gene
and
digger
and
bobby
we
had
so
many
coaches
we
had
so
many
coaches
that
came
out
in
our
do
well
with
coaches
but
the
coaches
like
me
but
bobby
was
out
here
working
really
hard
and
could
see
it
right
at
the
beginning
this
was
going
to
be
the
water
shed
but
bobby
came
out
and
came
out
and
we
went
to
arena
arenas
you
never
seen
so
many
people
maybe
you
been
at
some
of
the
arenas
it
is
amazing
so
here
is
the
story
folks
we
have
to
stop
four
more
years
of
we
got
to
stop
who
is
as
crooked
as
they
come
we
got
to
bring
our
country
back
we
have
to
make
great
trade
deals
again
we
going
to
make
deal
that
bring
our
jobs
back
and
we
going
to
get
along
great
with
these
countries
and
trade
with
these
countries
am
not
an
isolationist
free
trader
but
free
trade
tore
make
great
deal
trade
tore
make
great
deals
not
to
make
horrible
deals
one
of
the
people
standing
right
there
said
to
me
trump
are
you
an
isolationist
and
trump
and
said
no
and
what
is
your
definition
of
trade
and
said
very
simple
know
free
and
know
every
form
of
trade
known
to
mankind
here
is
my
definition
of
trade
my
definition
of
trade
is
that
want
to
make
great
deals
for
the
american
people
you
can
call
it
whatever
the
hell
you
want
okay
and
we
going
to
we
going
to
bring
our
jobs
back
we
going
to
bring
our
manufacturing
back
you
look
at
what
has
happened
to
the
manufacturing
since
bill
signed
probably
the
worst
deal
economically
in
the
history
of
our
country
that
deal
was
signed
by
bill
you
look
at
areas
even
from
here
but
you
look
at
places
you
look
at
places
like
new
england
and
new
york
state
and
great
state
we
leading
in
by
the
way
it
just
came
out
hear
we
leading
in
florida
hear
we
leading
in
ohio
hear
we
leading
all
over
the
place
and
the
poll
just
came
out
we
leading
but
we
have
long
way
to
go
we
are
dealing
with
dishonest
system
and
crooked
system
and
rigged
system
so
we
have
long
way
to
go
folks
and
we
do
want
anybody
to
take
it
away
from
us
and
when
this
person
said
to
me
by
the
way
what
you
done
is
never
done
before
congratulations
it
does
even
matter
if
you
win
or
lose
the
election
what
you
done
has
never
been
done
before
winning
all
of
the
primaries
beating
great
professionals
and
they
are
very
talented
people
it
has
never
been
done
before
you
will
go
down
in
the
history
books
trump
said
do
me
do
even
tell
me
about
it
because
if
do
win
the
next
one
will
consider
it
big
fat
waste
of
time
and
million
put
up
and
still
putting
up
lot
more
and
now
we
raised
million
last
month
and
we
started
toward
the
middle
of
the
month
and
everyone
was
shocked
and
much
of
that
money
came
in
small
donations
like
average
or
something
like
that
and
put
up
millions
but
did
it
like
want
to
people
and
want
people
to
raising
money
for
the
republican
party
and
the
that
is
what
we
want
to
do
because
we
want
to
keep
our
majority
we
want
to
keep
our
house
we
want
to
keep
our
senate
because
tell
you
what
if
we
can
do
that
and
we
have
trump
as
president
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
do
things
that
are
going
to
be
so
great
for
our
country
going
to
be
amazing
you
know
we
run
of
the
highest
taxed
nations
in
the
world
and
yet
in
going
around
and
meeting
with
people
small
business
people
big
business
people
if
they
had
their
chance
and
if
they
had
their
choice
they
would
rather
get
rid
of
rules
and
regulation
we
have
the
worst
regulations
anywhere
in
the
world
they
actually
would
rather
pay
more
tax
which
is
surprising
and
get
rid
of
these
regulations
that
are
choking
everybody
people
run
their
businesses
so
we
going
to
turn
things
around
we
going
to
turn
them
around
fast
we
not
going
to
lose
carrier
from
you
know
that
deal
very
well
those
people
have
followed
me
all
over
the
place

of
jobs
visually
their
moving
to
mexico

of
the
carrier

in
this
room
because
we
have
we
have
lot
look
at
that
why
are
you
in
the
back
row

should
be
in
the
front
row

we
had
during
the
season
we
had
so
many
of
them
that
followed
us
around

felt
so
badly
we
not
going
to
let
that
happen
people
and
countries
take
our
companies
and
take
our
jobs
there
are
going
to
be
consequences

take
them
because

to
let
carrier
come
in
and
make
in
mexico
and
sell
the
to
us
across
very
strong
border
now
without
consequence
and
when
we
explain
to
the
heads
of

here
is
the
story
either
stay
or
if
you
want
to
go
to
mexico
we
wish

of
luck
but
when
you
sell
your

are
going
to
pay
tax

you
know
what
is
going
to
happen

are
not
going
to

and
all
the
amazing
workers
here
for
hosting
us
today
am
going
to
talk
about
how
to
make
america
wealthy
again
we
are
thirty
miles
from
steel
city
played
central
role
in
building
our
nation
the
legacy
of
steelworkers
lives
in
the
bridges
railways
and
skyscrapers
that
make
up
our
great
american
landscape
but
our
loyalty
was
repaid
with
betrayal
our
politicians
have
aggressively
pursued
policy
of
moving
our
jobs
our
wealth
and
our
factories
to
mexico
and
overseas
has
made
the
financial
elite
who
donate
to
politicians
very
wealthy
but
it
has
left
millions
of
our
workers
with
nothing
but
poverty
and
heartache
when
foreign
steel
is
dumped
into
our
markets
threatening
our
factories
the
politicians
do
nothing
for
years
they
watched
on
the
sidelines
as
our
jobs
vanished
and
our
communities
were
plunged
into
unemployment
many
of
these
areas
have
still
never
recovered
our
politicians
took
away
from
the
people
their
means
of
making
living
and
supporting
their
families
skilled
craftsmen
and
tradespeople
and
factory
workers
have
seen
the
jobs
they
loved
shipped
thousands
of
miles
away
many
towns
once
thriving
and
humming
are
now
in
state
despair
this
wave
of
has
wiped
out
our
middle
class
it
have
to
be
this
way
we
can
turn
it
all
around
and
we
can
turn
it
around
fast
but
if
going
to
deliver
real
change
going
to
have
to
reject
the
campaign
of
fear
and
intimidation
being
pushed
by
powerful
corporations
media
elites
and
political
dynasties
the
people
who
rigged
the
system
for
their
benefit
will
do
anything
and
say
anything
to
keep
things
exactly
as
they
are
the
people
who
rigged
the
system
are
supporting
because
they
know
as
long
as
she
is
in
charge
nothing
will
ever
change
the
inner
cities
will
remain
poor
the
factories
will
remain
closed
the
borders
will
remain
open
the
special
interests
will
remain
firmly
in
control
and
her
friends
in
global
finance
want
to
scare
america
into
thinking
small
and
they
want
to
scare
the
american
people
out
of
voting
for
better
future
read
how
trump
says
win
trade
war
top
leader
blasts
trump
in
speeches
my
campaign
has
the
opposite
message
want
you
to
imagine
how
much
better
your
life
can
be
if
we
start
believing
in
america
again
want
you
to
imagine
how
much
better
our
future
can
be
if
we
declare
independence
from
the
elites
led
us
to
one
financial
and
foreign
policy
disaster
after
another
our
friends
in
britain
recently
voted
to
take
back
control
of
their
economy
politics
and
borders
was
on
the
right
side
of
that
issue
with
the
people
while
as
always
stood
with
the
elites
and
both
she
and
president
predicted
that
one
wrong
now
time
for
the
american
people
to
take
back
their
future
the
choice
we
face
we
can
either
give
in
to
campaign
of
fear
or
we
can
choose
to
believe
in
america
we
lost
our
way
when
we
stopped
believing
in
our
country
america
became
the
dominant
economy
by
becoming
the
dominant
producer
the
wealth
this
created
was
shared
broadly
creating
the
biggest
middle
class
the
world
had
ever
known
but
then
america
changed
its
policy
from
promoting
development
in
america
to
promoting
development
in
other
nations
we
allowed
foreign
countries
to
their
goods
devalue
their
currencies
violate
their
agreements
and
cheat
in
every
way
imaginable
trillions
of
our
dollars
and
millions
of
our
jobs
flowed
overseas
as
result
have
visited
cities
and
towns
across
this
country
where
third
or
even
half
of
manufacturing
jobs
have
been
wiped
out
in
the
last
years
today
we
import
nearly
billion
more
in
goods
than
we
export
this
is
not
some
natural
disaster
it
is
disaster
it
is
the
consequence
of
leadership
class
that
worships
over
this
is
direct
affront
to
our
founding
fathers
who
wanted
america
to
be
strong
independent
and
free
our
founding
fathers
understood
trade
george
washington
said
that
promotion
of
domestic
will
be
among
the
first
consequences
to
flow
from
an
energetic
spoke
frequently
of
the
of
encouraging
in
the
united
the
first
republican
president
abraham
lincoln
warned
that
abandonment
of
the
protective
policy
by
the
american
must
produce
want
and
ruin
among
our
our
original
constitution
did
not
even
have
an
income
tax
instead
it
had
tariffs
taxation
of
foreign
not
domestic
production
yet
today
years
after
the
revolution
we
have
turned
things
completely
we
tax
and
regulate
and
restrict
our
companies
to
death
then
we
allow
foreign
countries
that
cheat
to
export
their
goods
to
us
as
result
we
have
become
more
dependent
on
foreign
countries
than
ever
before
ladies
and
gentlemen
time
to
declare
our
economic
independence
once
again
that
means
reversing
two
of
the
worst
legacies
of
the
years
america
has
lost
nearly
of
its
manufacturing
jobs
since
even
as
the
country
has
increased
its
population
by
million
people
at
the
of
this
catastrophe
are
two
trade
deals
pushed
by
bill
and
first
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
or
second
entry
into
the
world
trade
was
the
worst
trade
deal
in
history
and
entrance
into
the
world
trade
has
enabled
the
greatest
jobs
theft
in
history
it
was
bill
who
signed
in
and
who
supported
it
it
was
also
bill
who
lobbied
for
disastrous
entry
into
the
world
trade
and
who
backed
that
terrible
agreement
then
as
secretary
of
state
stood
by
idly
while
china
cheated
on
its
currency
added
another
trillion
dollars
to
our
trade
deficits
and
stole
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
our
intellectual
property
the
city
of
and
the
state
of
have
lost
of
their
manufacturing
jobs
since
the
put
china
into
the
fifty
thousand
factories
across
america
have
shut
their
doors
in
that
time
almost
half
of
our
entire
manufacturing
trade
deficit
in
goods
with
the
world
is
the
result
of
trade
with
china
it
was
also
as
secretary
of
state
who
shoved
us
into
deal
with
south
korea
in
as
reported
by
the
economic
policy
institute
in
may
this
deal
doubled
our
trade
deficit
with
south
korea
and
destroyed
nearly
american
jobs
as
said
for
virtually
every
trade
agreement
that
has
cost
the
workers
of
this
country
millions
of
trade
reform
and
the
negotiation
of
great
trade
deals
is
the
quickest
way
to
bring
our
jobs
back
to
understand
why
trade
reform
creates
jobs
we
need
to
understand
how
all
nations
grow
and
prosper
massive
trade
deficits
subtract
directly
from
our
gross
domestic
product
from
to
span
of
over
five
decades
our
gross
domestic
product
grew
at
rate
of
however
since
the
year
after
we
fully
opened
our
markets
to
chinese
imports
that
growth
rate
has
been
cut
almost
in
half
what
does
this
mean
for
americans
for
every
one
percent
of
growth
we
fail
to
generate
in
any
given
year
we
also
fail
to
create
over
one
million
jobs
creation
due
to
slower
growth
since
is
well
over
million
jobs
and
just
about
the
number
of
jobs
our
country
needs
right
now
to
put
america
back
to
work
at
decent
wages
the
is
the
greatest
danger
yet
the
would
be
the
death
blow
for
american
manufacturing
it
would
give
up
all
of
our
economic
leverage
to
an
international
commission
that
would
put
the
interests
of
foreign
countries
above
our
own
it
would
further
open
our
markets
to
aggressive
currency
cheaters
it
would
make
it
easier
for
our
trading
competitors
to
ship
cheap
goods
into
markets
while
allowing
foreign
countries
to
continue
putting
barriers
in
front
of
our
exports
the
would
lower
tariffs
on
foreign
cars
while
leaving
in
place
the
foreign
practices
that
keep
american
cars
from
being
sold
overseas
the
even
created
for
china
to
supply
car
parts
for
made
in
mexico
the
agreement
would
also
force
american
workers
to
compete
directly
against
workers
from
one
of
the
lowest
wage
countries
on
earth
not
only
will
the
undermine
our
economy
but
it
will
undermine
our
independence
the
creates
new
international
commission
that
makes
decisions
the
american
people
veto
these
commissions
are
great
wall
street
who
can
spend
vast
amounts
of
money
to
influence
the
outcomes
it
should
be
no
surprise
then
that
according
to
took
part
in
drafting
the
she
praised
or
pushed
the
on
separate
occasions
and
even
called
it
the
was
totally
for
the
just
short
while
ago
but
when
she
saw
my
stance
which
is
totally
against
she
was
shamed
into
saying
she
would
be
against
it
too
but
have
no
doubt
she
will
immediately
approve
it
if
it
is
put
before
her
guaranteed
she
will
do
this
just
as
she
has
betrayed
american
workers
for
wall
street
throughout
her
career
how
it
would
go
she
would
make
small
token
change
declare
the
pact
fixed
and
ram
it
through
why
is
now
only
saying
she
has
problems
with
the
its
current
form
ensuring
that
she
can
rush
to
embrace
it
again
at
her
earliest
opportunity
if
the
media
believe
me
have
challenge
for
you
ask
if
she
is
willing
to
withdraw
from
the
her
first
day
in
office
and
unconditionally
rule
out
its
passage
in
any
form
there
is
no
way
to
the
we
need
bilateral
trade
deals
we
do
not
need
to
enter
into
another
massive
international
agreement
that
ties
us
up
and
binds
us
down
trump
administration
will
change
our
failed
trade
policy
quickly
here
are
steps
would
pursue
right
away
to
bring
back
our
jobs
one
am
going
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
partnership
which
has
not
yet
been
ratified
two
going
to
appoint
the
toughest
and
smartest
trade
negotiators
to
fight
on
behalf
of
american
workers
three
going
to
direct
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
identify
every
violation
of
trade
agreements
foreign
country
is
currently
using
to
harm
our
workers
will
then
direct
all
appropriate
agencies
to
use
every
tool
under
american
and
international
law
to
end
these
abuses
four
going
tell
our
partners
that
intend
to
immediately
renegotiate
the
terms
of
that
agreement
to
get
better
deal
for
our
workers
and
mean
just
little
bit
better
mean
lot
better
if
they
do
not
agree
to
renegotiation
then
will
submit
notice
under
article
of
the
agreement
that
america
intends
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
five
am
going
to
instruct
my
treasury
secretary
to
label
china
currency
manipulator
any
country
that
devalues
their
currency
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
united
states
will
be
met
with
sharply
six
am
going
to
instruct
the
trade
representative
to
bring
trade
cases
against
china
both
in
this
country
and
at
the
unfair
subsidy
is
prohibited
by
the
terms
of
its
entrance
to
the
and
intend
to
enforce
those
rules
seven
if
china
does
not
stop
its
illegal
activities
including
its
theft
of
american
trade
secrets
will
use
every
lawful
presidential
power
to
remedy
trade
disputes
including
the
application
of
tariffs
consistent
with
section
and
of
the
trade
act
of
and
section
of
the
trade
expansion
act
of
president
deployed
similar
trade
measures
when
motorcycle
and
semiconductor
imports
threatened
industry
his
tariff
on
motorcycles
was
and
his
tariff
to
shield
semiconductor
industry
was
and
her
campaign
of
fear
will
try
to
spread
the
lie
that
these
actions
will
start
trade
war
she
has
it
completely
backwards
unleashed
trade
war
against
the
american
worker
when
she
supported
one
terrible
trade
deal
after
another
from
to
china
to
south
korea
trump
administration
will
end
that
war
by
getting
fair
deal
for
the
american
people
the
era
of
economic
surrender
will
finally
be
over
new
era
of
prosperity
will
finally
begin
america
will
be
independent
once
more
under
trump
presidency
the
american
worker
will
finally
have
president
who
will
protect
them
and
fight
for
them
we
will
stand
up
to
trade
cheating
anywhere
and
everywhere
it
threatens
an
american
job
we
will
make
america
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
start
business
hire
workers
and
open
factory
this
includes
massive
tax
reform
to
lift
the
crushing
burdens
on
american
workers
and
businesses
we
will
also
get
rid
of
wasteful
rules
and
regulations
which
are
destroying
our
job
creation
capacity
many
people
think
that
these
regulations
are
an
even
greater
impediment
than
the
fact
that
we
are
one
of
the
highest
taxed
nations
in
the
world
we
are
also
going
to
fully
capture
tremendous
energy
capacity
this
will
create
vast
profits
for
our
workers
and
begin
reducing
our
deficit
wants
to
shut
down
energy
production
and
shut
down
the
mines
trump
administration
will
also
ensure
that
we
start
using
american
steel
for
american
infrastructure
just
like
the
american
steel
from
that
built
the
empire
state
building
it
will
be
american
steel
that
will
fortify
crumbling
bridges
it
will
be
american
steel
that
sends
our
skyscrapers
soaring
into
the
sky
it
will
be
american
steel
that
rebuilds
our
inner
cities
it
will
be
american
hands
that
remake
this
country
and
it
will
be
american
energy
mined
from
american
resources
that
powers
this
country
it
will
be
american
workers
