to
chip
and
who
graciously
shared
your
father
with
nation
that
loved
him
to
friends
colleagues
and
all
who
considered
him
hero
to
the
men
of
the
intrepid
to
all
of
you
who
are
gathered
here
today
am
to
be
here
to
pay
tribute
to
the
life
and
times
of
the
man
who
chronicled
our
time
did
not
know
personally
and
my
regret
is
made
more
acute
by
the
stories
that
have
been
shared
here
today
nor
for
that
matter
did
know
him
any
better
than
the
tens
of
millions
who
turned
to
him
each
night
in
search
of
the
answer
to
simple
question
what
happened
today
but
like
them
and
like
all
of
you
have
benefited
as
citizen
from
his
dogged
pursuit
of
the
truth
his
passionate
of
objective
reporting
and
his
view
that
journalism
is
more
than
just
profession
it
is
public
good
vital
to
our
democracy
even
in
his
early
career
resisted
the
temptation
to
get
the
story
first
in
of
getting
it
right
he
wanted
to
get
it
first
but
he
understood
the
importance
of
getting
it
right
during
one
of
his
first
jobs
in
city
program
manager
urged
him
to
go
on
the
air
reporting
massive
blaze
and
we
just
heard
how
much
he
loved
fires
massive
blaze
at
city
hall
that
had
already
claimed
lives
when
reached
for
the
telephone
his
boss
asked
what
are
you
doing
get
on
the
air
replied
that
he
was
calling
the
fire
department
to
confirm
the
story
you
do
need
to
confirm
it
the
manager
shouted
my
wife
is
watching
the
whole
thing
needless
to
say
made
the
call
and
even
as
the
program
manager
took
to
the
air
himself
to
broadcast
the
unfolding
tragedy
discovered
that
it
had
been
nothing
more
than
small
fire
that
had
resulted
in
any
injuries
he
lost
his
job
but
he
got
the
story
right
was
afraid
to
rattle
the
high
and
the
mighty
either
but
he
never
dared
to
compromise
his
integrity
he
got
along
with
elected
officials
even
if
they
were
wary
of
one
another
motives
one
politician
once
remarked
my
friend
you
got
to
believe
me
fully
percent
of
everything
told
you
today
is
the
absolute
truth
he
shared
complicated
relationship
with
presidents
of
both
parties
who
wanted
him
on
their
side
even
as
they
were
convinced
that
he
was
president
called
after
the
evening
news
from
time
to
time
to
voice
his
displeasure
over
certain
story
but
knew
that
if
he
was
receiving
vociferous
complaints
from
both
sides
he
must
be
doing
his
job
his
endless
inquisitiveness
about
our
world
can
imagine
came
from
mother
who
sold
encyclopedias
for
living
as
boy
spent
countless
hours
getting
lost
within
their
pages
endlessly
sidetracked
by
new
and
interesting
entries
that
branched
off
from
one
another
fascinated
by
the
world
around
us
and
how
it
worked
and
that
the
way
he
lived
his
life
with
curiosity
exploring
our
planet
seeking
to
make
sense
of
it
and
explaining
it
to
others
he
went
everywhere
and
he
did
everything
he
raced
cars
and
boats
he
everywhere
from
the
amazon
to
the
arctic
he
plunged
feet
below
the
sea
trekked
feet
up
into
the
and
experienced
weightlessness
in
the
upper
reaches
of
our
atmosphere
all
with
one
mission
to
make
it
come
alive
for
the
rest
of
us
and
as
our
world
began
to
change
he
helped
us
understand
those
changes
he
was
forever
there
reporting
through
world
war
and
cold
war
marches
and
milestones
scandal
and
success
calmly
and
authoritatively
telling
us
what
we
needed
to
know
he
was
voice
of
certainty
in
world
that
was
growing
more
and
more
uncertain
and
through
it
all
he
never
lost
the
integrity
or
the
speaking
style
that
he
gained
growing
up
in
the
heartland
he
was
familiar
and
welcome
voice
that
spoke
to
each
and
every
one
of
us
personally
so
it
may
have
seemed
inevitable
that
he
was
named
the
most
trusted
man
in
america
but
here
the
thing
that
title
was
bestowed
on
him
by
network
we
were
told
to
believe
it
by
some
advertising
campaign
it
was
earned
it
was
earned
by
year
after
year
and
decade
after
decade
of
painstaking
effort
commitment
to
fundamental
values
his
belief
that
the
american
people
were
hungry
for
the
truth
unvarnished
and
unaccompanied
by
theatre
or
spectacle
he
did
believe
in
down
he
trusted
us
when
he
was
told
of
this
extraordinary
that
he
was
the
most
trusted
man
in
america
he
naturally
downplayed
it
by
saying
the
people
had
not
polled
his
wife
when
people
of
both
political
parties
actually
tried
to
recruit
him
to
run
for
office
without
even
asking
for
his
stances
on
the
issues
he
said
no
to
the
relief
of
all
potential
opponents
and
when
even
decade
and
half
after
his
retirement
he
still
ranked
first
in
seven
of
eight
categories
for
television
journalists
he
was
disbelieving
that
he
had
won
the
eighth
category
attractiveness
through
all
the
events
that
came
to
define
the
century
through
all
our
moments
of
deepest
hurt
and
brightest
hope
was
there
telling
the
story
of
the
american
age
and
this
is
how
we
remember
him
today
but
we
also
remember
and
celebrate
the
journalism
that
standard
of
honesty
and
integrity
and
responsibility
to
which
so
many
of
you
have
committed
your
careers
it
standard
that
little
bit
harder
to
find
today
we
know
that
this
is
difficult
time
for
journalism
even
as
appetites
for
news
and
information
grow
are
closing
despite
the
big
stories
of
our
era
serious
journalists
find
themselves
all
too
often
without
beat
just
as
the
news
cycle
has
shrunk
so
has
the
bottom
line
and
too
often
we
fill
that
void
with
instant
commentary
and
celebrity
gossip
and
the
softer
stories
that
disdained
rather
than
the
hard
news
and
investigative
journalism
he
championed
what
happened
today
is
replaced
with
who
won
today
the
public
debate
cheapens
the
public
trust
falters
we
fail
to
understand
our
world
or
one
another
as
well
as
we
should
and
that
has
real
consequences
in
our
own
lives
and
in
the
life
of
our
nation
we
seem
stuck
with
choice
between
what
cuts
to
our
bottom
line
and
what
harms
us
as
society
which
price
is
higher
to
pay
which
cost
is
harder
to
bear
this
democracy
said
can
not
function
without
reasonably
electorate
that
why
the
honest
objective
meticulous
reporting
that
so
many
of
you
pursue
with
the
same
zeal
that
did
is
so
vital
to
our
democracy
and
our
society
our
future
depends
on
it
was
no
naive
idealist
he
understood
the
challenges
and
the
pressures
and
the
temptations
facing
journalism
in
this
new
era
he
believed
that
media
company
has
an
obligation
to
pursue
profit
but
also
an
obligation
to
invest
good
chunk
of
that
profit
back
into
news
and
public
affairs
he
was
excited
about
all
the
stories
that
world
of
journalism
would
be
able
to
tell
and
all
the
means
with
which
to
tell
it
naturally
we
find
ourselves
wondering
how
he
would
have
covered
the
monumental
stories
of
our
time
in
an
era
where
the
news
that
city
hall
is
on
fire
can
sweep
around
the
world
at
the
speed
of
the
internet
would
he
still
have
called
to
would
he
have
been
able
to
cut
through
the
murky
noise
of
the
and
the
tweets
and
the
sound
bites
to
shine
the
bright
light
on
substance
would
he
still
offer
the
perspective
that
we
value
would
he
have
been
able
to
remain
singular
figure
in
an
age
of
dwindling
attention
spans
and
omnipresent
media
and
somehow
we
know
that
the
answer
is
yes
the
simple
values
set
out
in
pursuit
of
to
seek
the
truth
to
keep
us
honest
to
explore
our
world
the
best
he
could
they
are
as
vital
today
as
they
ever
were
our
american
story
continues
it
needs
to
be
told
and
if
we
choose
to
live
up
to
example
if
we
that
the
kind
of
journalism
he
embodied
will
not
simply
rekindle
itself
as
part
of
natural
cycle
but
will
come
alive
only
if
we
stand
up
and
demand
it
and
resolve
to
value
it
once
again
then
convinced
that
the
choice
between
profit
and
progress
is
false
one
and
that
the
golden
days
of
journalism
still
lie
ahead
invited
nation
to
believe
in
him
and
he
never
betrayed
that
trust
that
why
so
many
of
you
entered
the
profession
in
the
first
place
that
why
the
standards
he
set
for
journalists
still
stand
and
that
why
he
loved
and
valued
all
of
you
but
we
loved
and
valued
not
only
as
the
rarest
of
men
but
as
an
indispensable
pillar
of
our
society
he
reunited
with
his
beloved
now
watching
the
stories
of
this
century
unfold
with
boundless
optimism
every
so
often
punctuating
the
air
with
gleeful
oh
boy
we
are
grateful
to
him
for
altering
and
illuminating
our
time
and
for
the
opportunity
he
gave
to
us
to
say
that
yes
we
too
were
there
thank
you
very
much
hello
everybody
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
everybody
all
right
everybody
go
ahead
and
have
seat
how
is
everybody
doing
today
how
about
spicer
am
here
with
students
at
high
school
in
virginia
and
we
got
students
tuning
in
from
all
across
america
from
kindergarten
through
grade
and
am
just
so
glad
that
all
could
join
us
today
and
want
to
thank
for
being
such
an
outstanding
host
give
yourselves
big
round
of
applause
know
that
for
many
of
you
today
is
the
first
day
of
school
and
for
those
of
you
in
kindergarten
or
starting
middle
or
high
school
it
your
first
day
in
new
school
so
it
understandable
if
you
little
nervous
imagine
there
are
some
seniors
out
there
who
are
feeling
pretty
good
right
now
with
just
one
more
year
to
go
and
no
matter
what
grade
you
in
some
of
you
are
probably
wishing
it
were
still
summer
and
you
could
stayed
in
bed
just
little
bit
longer
this
morning
know
that
feeling
when
was
young
my
family
lived
overseas
lived
in
for
few
years
and
my
mother
she
did
have
the
money
to
send
me
where
all
the
american
kids
went
to
school
but
she
thought
it
was
important
for
me
to
keep
up
with
an
american
education
so
she
decided
to
teach
me
extra
lessons
herself
monday
through
friday
but
because
she
had
to
go
to
work
the
only
time
she
could
do
it
was
at
in
the
morning
now
as
you
might
imagine
was
too
happy
about
getting
up
that
early
and
lot
of
times
fall
asleep
right
there
at
the
kitchen
table
but
whenever
complain
my
mother
would
just
give
me
one
of
those
looks
and
she
say
this
is
no
picnic
for
me
either
so
know
that
some
of
you
are
still
adjusting
to
being
back
at
school
but
here
today
because
have
something
important
to
discuss
with
you
here
because
want
to
talk
with
you
about
your
education
and
what
expected
of
all
of
you
in
this
new
school
year
now
given
lot
of
speeches
about
education
and
talked
about
responsibility
lot
talked
about
teachers
responsibility
for
inspiring
students
and
pushing
you
to
learn
talked
about
your
parents
responsibility
for
making
sure
you
stay
on
track
and
you
get
your
homework
done
and
do
spend
every
waking
hour
in
front
of
the
or
with
the
talked
lot
about
your
government
responsibility
for
setting
high
standards
and
supporting
teachers
and
principals
and
turning
around
schools
that
are
working
where
students
are
getting
the
opportunities
that
they
deserve
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
can
have
the
most
dedicated
teachers
the
most
supportive
parents
the
best
schools
in
the
world
and
none
of
it
will
make
difference
none
of
it
will
matter
unless
all
of
you
your
responsibilities
unless
you
show
up
to
those
schools
unless
you
pay
attention
to
those
teachers
unless
you
listen
to
your
parents
and
grandparents
and
other
adults
and
put
in
the
hard
work
it
takes
to
succeed
that
what
want
to
focus
on
today
the
responsibility
each
of
you
has
for
your
education
want
to
start
with
the
responsibility
you
have
to
yourself
every
single
one
of
you
has
something
that
you
good
at
every
single
one
of
you
has
something
to
offer
and
you
have
responsibility
to
yourself
to
discover
what
that
is
that
the
opportunity
an
education
can
provide
maybe
you
could
be
great
writer
maybe
even
good
enough
to
write
book
or
articles
in
newspaper
but
you
might
not
know
it
until
you
write
that
english
paper
that
english
class
paper
that
assigned
to
you
maybe
you
could
be
an
innovator
or
an
inventor
maybe
even
good
enough
to
come
up
with
the
next
or
the
new
medicine
or
vaccine
but
you
might
not
know
it
until
you
do
your
project
for
your
science
class
maybe
you
could
be
mayor
or
senator
or
supreme
court
justice
but
you
might
not
know
that
until
you
join
student
government
or
the
debate
team
and
no
matter
what
you
want
to
do
with
your
life
guarantee
that
you
need
an
education
to
do
it
you
want
to
be
doctor
or
teacher
or
police
officer
you
want
to
be
nurse
or
an
architect
lawyer
or
member
of
our
military
you
going
to
need
good
education
for
every
single
one
of
those
careers
you
can
not
drop
out
of
school
and
just
drop
into
good
job
you
got
to
train
for
it
and
work
for
it
and
learn
for
it
and
this
is
just
important
for
your
own
life
and
your
own
future
what
you
make
of
your
education
will
decide
nothing
less
than
the
future
of
this
country
the
future
of
america
depends
on
you
what
you
learning
in
school
today
will
determine
whether
we
as
nation
can
meet
our
greatest
challenges
in
the
future
you
need
the
knowledge
and
skills
you
learn
in
science
and
math
to
cure
diseases
like
cancer
and
aids
and
to
develop
new
energy
technologies
and
protect
our
environment

need
the
insights
and
skills
you
gain
in
history
and
social
studies
to
fight
poverty
and
homelessness
crime
and
discrimination
and
make
our
nation
more
fair
and
more
free
you
need
the
creativity
and
ingenuity
you
develop
in
all
your
classes
to
build
new
companies
that
will
create
new
jobs
and
boost
our
economy

every
single
one
of
you
to
develop
your
talents
and
your
skills
and
your
intellect
so
you
can
help
us
old
folks
solve
our
most
difficult
problems
if

lot
of
you
have
challenges
in
your
lives
right
now
that
can
make
it
hard
to
focus
on
your
get
it
know
what
it
like
my
father
left
my
family
when
was
two
years
old
and
was
raised
by
single
mom
who
had
to
work
and
who
struggled
at
times
to
pay
the
bills
and
was
always
able
to
give
us
the
things
that
other
kids
had
there
were
times
when
missed
having
father
in
my
life
there
were
times
when
was
lonely
and
felt
like
did
fit
in
so
was
always
as
focused
as
should
have
been
on
school
and
did
some
things
not
proud
of
and
got
in
more
trouble
than
should
have
and
my
life
could
have
easily
taken
turn
for
the
worse
but
was
was
lucky
got
lot
of
second
chances
and
had
the
opportunity
to
go
to
college
and
law
school
and
follow
my
dreams
my
wife
our
first
lady
she
has
similar
story
neither
of
her
parents
had
gone
to
college
and
they
did
have
lot
of
money
but
they
worked
hard
and
she
worked
hard
so
that
she
could
go
to
the
best
schools
in
this
country
some
of
you
might
not
have
those
advantages
maybe
you
do
have
adults
in
your
life
who
give
you
the
support
that
you
need
maybe
someone
in
your
family
has
lost
their
job
and
there
not
enough
money
to
go
around
maybe
you
live
in
where
you
do
feel
safe
or
have
friends
who
are
pressuring
you
to
do
things
you
know
are
right
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
circumstances
of
your
life
what
you
look
like
where
you
come
from
how
much
money
you
have
what
you
got
going
on
at
home
none
of
that
is
an
excuse
for
neglecting
your
homework
or
having
bad
attitude
in
school
that
no
excuse
for
talking
back
to
your
teacher
or
cutting
class
or
dropping
out
of
school
there
is
no
excuse
for
not
trying
where
you
are
right
now
does
have
to
determine
where
you
end
up
no
one
written
your
destiny
for
you
because
here
in
america
you
write
your
own
destiny
you
make
your
own
future
that
what
young
people
like
you
are
doing
every
day
all
across
america
young
people
like
from
texas
did
speak
english
when
she
first
started
school
neither
of
her
parents
had
gone
to
college
but
she
worked
hard
earned
good
grades
and
got
scholarship
to
brown
university
is
now
in
graduate
school
studying
public
health
on
her
way
to
becoming
thinking
about
from
california
who
fought
brain
cancer
since
he
was
three
he
had
to
endure
all
sorts
of
treatments
and
surgeries
one
of
which
affected
his
memory
so
it
took
him
much
longer
hundreds
of
extra
hours
to
do
his
but
he
never
fell
behind
he
headed
to
college
this
fall
and
then
there
from
my
of
chicago
illinois
even
when
bouncing
from
foster
home
to
foster
home
in
the
toughest
in
the
city
she
managed
to
get
job
at
local
health
care
start
program
to
keep
young
people
out
of
gangs
and
she
on
track
to
graduate
high
school
with
honors
and
go
on
to
college
and
and
are
any
different
from
any
of
you
they
face
challenges
in
their
lives
just
like
you
do
in
some
cases
they
got
it
lot
worse
off
than
many
of
you
but
they
refused
to
give
up
they
chose
to
take
responsibility
for
their
lives
for
their
education
and
set
goals
for
themselves
and
expect
all
of
you
to
do
the
same
that
why
today
calling
on
each
of
you
to
set
your
own
goals
for
your
education
and
do
everything
you
can
to
meet
them
your
goal
can
be
something
as
simple
as
doing
all
your
homework
paying
attention
in
class
or
spending
some
time
each
day
reading
book
maybe
you
decide
to
get
involved
in
an
activity
or
volunteer
in
your
community
maybe
you
decide
to
stand
up
for
kids
who
are
being
teased
or
bullied
because
of
who
they
are
or
how
they
look
because
you
believe
like
do
that
all
young
people
deserve
safe
environment
to
study
and
learn
maybe
you
decide
to
take
better
care
of
yourself
so
you
can
be
more
ready
to
learn
and
along
those
lines
by
the
way
hope
all
of
you
are
washing
your
hands
lot
and
that
you
stay
home
from
school
when
you
do
feel
well
so
we
can
keep
people
from
getting
the
this
fall
and
winter
but
whatever
you
resolve
to
do
want
you
to
commit
to
it
want
you
to
really
work
at
it
know
that
sometimes
you
get
that
sense
from
that
you
can
be
rich
and
successful
without
any
hard
work
that
your
ticket
to
success
is
through
rapping
or
basketball
or
being
reality
star
chances
are
you
not
going
to
be
any
of
those
things
the
truth
is
being
successful
is
hard
you
love
every
subject
that
you
study
you
click
with
every
teacher
that
you
have
not
every
homework
assignment
will
seem
completely
relevant
to
your
life
right
at
this
minute
and
you
necessarily
succeed
at
everything
the
first
time
you
try
that
okay
some
of
the
most
successful
people
in
the
world
are
the
ones
who
had
the
most
failures
who
wrote
harry
potter
her
first
harry
potter
book
was
rejected
times
before
it
was
finally
published
was
cut
from
his
high
school
basketball
team
he
lost
hundreds
of
games
and
missed
thousands
of
shots
during
his
career
but
he
once
said
have
failed
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
my
life
and
that
why
succeed
these
people
succeeded
because
they
understood
that
you
let
your
failures
define
you
you
have
to
let
your
failures
teach
you
you
have
to
let
them
show
you
what
to
do
differently
the
next
time
so
if
you
get
into
trouble
that
does
mean
you
troublemaker
it
means
you
need
to
try
harder
to
act
right
if
you
get
bad
grade
that
does
mean
you
stupid
it
just
means
you
need
to
spend
more
time
studying
no
one
born
being
good
at
all
things
you
become
good
at
things
through
hard
work
you
not
varsity
athlete
the
first
time
you
play
new
sport
you
do
hit
every
note
the
first
time
you
sing
song
you
got
to
practice
the
same
principle
applies
to
your
you
might
have
to
do
math
problem
few
times
before
you
get
it
right
you
might
have
to
read
something
few
times
before
you
understand
it
you
definitely
have
to
do
few
drafts
of
paper
before
it
good
enough
to
hand
in
do
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
do
be
afraid
to
ask
for
help
when
you
need
it
do
that
every
day
asking
for
help
is
sign
of
weakness
it
sign
of
strength
because
it
shows
you
have
the
courage
to
admit
when
you
do
know
something
and
that
then
allows
you
to
learn
something
new
so
find
an
adult
that
you
trust
parent
grandparent
or
teacher
coach
or
and
ask
them
to
help
you
stay
on
track
to
meet
your
goals
and
even
when
you
struggling
even
when
you
discouraged
and
you
feel
like
other
people
have
given
up
on
you
do
ever
give
up
on
yourself
because
when
you
give
up
on
yourself
you
give
up
on
your
country
the
story
of
america
is
about
people
who
quit
when
things
got
tough
it
about
people
who
kept
going
who
tried
harder
who
loved
their
country
too
much
to
do
anything
less
than
their
best
it
the
story
of
students
who
sat
where
you
sit
years
ago
and
went
on
to
wage
revolution
and
they
founded
this
nation
young
people
students
who
sat
where
you
sit
years
ago
who
overcame
depression
and
won
world
war
who
fought
for
civil
rights
and
put
man
on
the
moon
students
who
sat
where
you
sit
years
ago
who
founded
and
twitter
and
and
changed
the
way
we
communicate
with
each
other
so
today
want
to
ask
all
of
you
what
your
contribution
going
to
be
what
problems
are
you
going
to
solve
what
discoveries
will
you
make
what
will
president
who
comes
here
in
or
or
years
say
about
what
all
of
you
did
for
this
country
now
your
families
your
teachers
and
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
you
have
the
education
you
need
to
answer
these
questions
working
hard
to
fix
up
your
classrooms
and
get
you
the
books
and
the
equipment
and
the
computers
you
need
to
learn
but
you
got
to
do
your
part
too
so
expect
all
of
you
to
get
serious
this
year
expect
you
to
put
your
best
effort
into
everything
you
do
expect
great
things
from
each
of
you
so
do
let
us
down
do
let
your
family
down
or
your
country
down
most
of
all
do
let
yourself
down
make
us
all
proud
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
america
thank
you
your
eminence
members
of
the
kennedy
family
distinguished
guests
and
fellow
citizens
today
we
say
goodbye
to
the
youngest
child
of
rose
and
joseph
kennedy
the
world
will
long
remember
their
son
as
the
heir
to
weighty
legacy
champion
for
those
who
had
none
the
soul
of
the
democratic
party
and
the
lion
of
the
senate
man
whose
name
graces
nearly
one
thousand
laws
and
who
penned
more
than
three
hundred
himself
but
those
of
us
who
loved
him
and
ache
with
his
passing
know
ted
kennedy
by
the
other
titles
he
held
father
brother
husband
uncle
teddy
or
as
he
was
often
known
to
his
younger
nieces
and
nephews
the
grand
or
the
big
cheese
like
so
many
others
in
the
city
where
he
worked
for
nearly
half
century
knew
him
as
colleague
mentor
and
above
all
friend
ted
kennedy
was
the
baby
of
the
family
who
became
its
patriarch
the
restless
dreamer
who
became
its
rock
he
was
the
sunny
joyful
child
who
bore
the
brunt
of
his
brothers
teasing
but
learned
quickly
how
to
brush
it
off
when
they
tossed
him
off
boat
because
he
did
know
what
was
teddy
got
back
in
and
learned
to
sail
when
photographer
asked
the
bobby
to
step
back
at
press
conference
because
he
was
casting
shadow
on
his
younger
brother
teddy
quipped
it
be
the
same
in
washington
this
spirit
of
resilience
and
good
would
see
ted
kennedy
through
more
pain
and
tragedy
than
most
of
us
will
ever
know
he
lost
two
siblings
by
the
age
of
sixteen
he
saw
two
more
taken
violently
from
the
country
that
loved
them
he
said
goodbye
to
his
beloved
sister
in
the
final
days
of
his
own
life
he
narrowly
survived
plane
crash
watched
two
children
struggle
with
cancer
buried
three
nephews
and
experienced
personal
failings
and
setbacks
in
the
most
public
way
possible
it
is
string
of
events
that
would
have
broken
lesser
man
and
it
would
have
been
easy
for
teddy
to
let
himself
become
bitter
and
hardened
to
surrender
to
and
regret
to
retreat
from
public
life
and
live
out
his
years
in
peaceful
quiet
no
one
would
have
blamed
him
for
that
but
that
was
not
ted
kennedy
as
he
told
us
faults
and
frailties
are
no
excuse
to
give
in
and
no
exemption
from
the
common
obligation
to
give
of
ourselves
indeed
ted
was
the
happy
warrior
that
the
poet
spoke
of
when
he
wrote
as
tempted
more
more
able
to
endure
as
more
exposed
to
suffering
and
distress
thence
also
more
alive
to
tenderness
through
his
own
suffering
ted
kennedy
became
more
alive
to
the
plight
and
suffering
of
others
the
sick
child
who
could
not
see
doctor
the
young
soldier
sent
to
battle
without
the
citizen
denied
her
rights
because
of
what
she
looks
like
or
who
she
loves
or
where
she
comes
from
the
landmark
laws
that
he
championed
the
civil
rights
act
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
immigration
reform
children
health
care
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
have
running
thread
ted
kennedy
life
work
was
not
to
champion
those
with
wealth
or
power
or
special
connections
it
was
to
give
voice
to
those
who
were
not
heard
to
add
rung
to
the
ladder
of
opportunity
to
make
real
the
dream
of
our
founding
he
was
given
the
gift
of
time
that
his
brothers
were
not
and
he
used
that
gift
to
touch
as
many
lives
and
right
as
many
wrongs
as
the
years
would
allow
we
can
still
hear
his
voice
bellowing
through
the
senate
chamber
face
reddened
fist
pounding
the
podium
veritable
force
of
nature
in
support
of
health
care
or
workers
rights
or
civil
rights
and
yet
while
his
causes
became
deeply
personal
his
disagreements
never
did
while
he
was
seen
by
his
fiercest
critics
as
partisan
lightning
rod
that
is
not
the
prism
through
which
ted
kennedy
saw
the
world
nor
was
it
the
prism
through
which
his
colleagues
saw
him
he
was
product
of
an
age
when
the
joy
and
nobility
of
politics
prevented
differences
of
party
and
philosophy
from
becoming
barriers
to
cooperation
and
mutual
respect
time
when
adversaries
still
saw
each
other
as
patriots
and
that
how
ted
kennedy
became
the
greatest
legislator
of
our
time
he
did
it
by
hewing
to
principle
but
also
by
seeking
compromise
and
common
cause
not
through
and
alone
but
through
friendship
and
kindness
and
there
was
the
time
he
courted
hatch
support
for
the
children
health
insurance
program
by
having
his
chief
of
staff
serenade
the
senator
with
song
had
written
himself
the
time
he
delivered
shamrock
cookies
on
china
plate
to
sweeten
up
crusty
republican
colleague
and
the
famous
story
of
how
he
won
the
support
of
texas
committee
chairman
on
an
immigration
bill
teddy
walked
into
meeting
with
plain
manila
envelope
and
showed
only
the
chairman
that
it
was
filled
with
the
texan
cigars
when
the
negotiations
were
going
well
he
would
inch
the
envelope
closer
to
the
chairman
when
they
were
he
would
pull
it
back
before
long
the
deal
was
done
it
was
only
few
years
ago
on
day
when
teddy
buttonholed
me
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
for
my
support
on
certain
piece
of
legislation
that
was
coming
up
for
vote
gave
him
my
pledge
but
expressed
my
that
it
would
pass
but
when
the
roll
call
was
over
the
bill
garnered
the
votes
it
needed
and
then
some
looked
at
teddy
with
astonishment
and
asked
how
he
had
pulled
it
off
he
just
patted
me
on
the
back
and
said
luck
of
the
irish
of
course
luck
had
little
to
do
with
ted
kennedy
legislative
success
and
he
knew
that
few
years
ago
his
told
him
that
he
and
daniel
just
might
be
the
two
greatest
senators
of
all
time
without
missing
beat
teddy
replied
what
did
do
but
though
it
is
ted
kennedy
historic
body
of
achievements
we
will
remember
it
is
his
giving
heart
that
we
will
miss
it
was
the
friend
and
colleague
who
was
always
the
first
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
say
sorry
for
your
loss
or
hope
you
feel
better
or
what
can
do
to
help
it
was
the
boss
who
was
so
adored
by
his
staff
that
over
five
hundred
spanning
five
decades
showed
up
for
his
birthday
party
it
was
the
man
who
sent
birthday
wishes
and
thank
you
notes
and
even
his
own
paintings
to
so
many
who
never
imagined
that
senator
would
take
the
time
to
think
about
someone
like
them
have
one
of
those
paintings
in
my
private
study
cape
cod
seascape
that
was
gift
to
freshman
legislator
who
happened
to
admire
it
when
ted
kennedy
welcomed
him
into
his
office
the
first
week
he
arrived
in
washington
by
the
way
that
my
second
gift
from
teddy
and
after
our
dog
and
it
seems
like
everyone
has
one
of
those
stories
the
ones
that
often
start
with
you
would
believe
who
called
me
today
ted
kennedy
was
the
father
who
looked
after
not
only
his
own
three
children
but
john
and
bobby
as
well
he
took
them
camping
and
taught
them
to
sail
he
laughed
and
danced
with
them
at
birthdays
and
weddings
cried
and
mourned
with
them
through
hardship
and
tragedy
and
passed
on
that
same
sense
of
service
and
that
his
parents
had
instilled
in
him
shortly
after
ted
walked
down
the
aisle
and
gave
her
away
at
the
altar
he
received
note
from
that
read
on
you
the
carefree
youngest
brother
fell
burden
hero
would
have
begged
to
be
spared
we
are
all
going
to
make
it
because
you
were
always
there
with
your
love
not
only
did
the
kennedy
family
make
it
because
of
ted
love
he
made
it
because
of
theirs
and
especially
because
of
the
love
and
the
life
he
found
in
after
so
much
loss
and
so
much
sorrow
it
could
not
have
been
easy
for
ted
kennedy
to
risk
his
heart
again
that
he
did
is
testament
to
how
deeply
he
loved
this
remarkable
woman
from
and
she
did
just
love
him
back
as
ted
would
often
acknowledge
saved
him
she
gave
him
strength
and
purpose
joy
and
friendship
and
stood
by
him
always
especially
in
those
last
hardest
days
we
can
not
know
for
certain
how
long
we
have
here
we
can
not
foresee
the
trials
or
misfortunes
that
will
test
us
along
the
way
we
can
not
know
god
plan
for
us
what
we
can
do
is
to
live
out
our
lives
as
best
we
can
with
purpose
and
love
and
joy
we
can
use
each
day
to
show
those
who
are
closest
to
us
how
much
we
care
about
them
and
treat
others
with
the
kindness
and
respect
that
we
wish
for
ourselves
we
can
learn
from
our
mistakes
and
grow
from
our
failures
and
we
can
strive
at
all
costs
to
make
better
world
so
that
someday
if
we
are
blessed
with
the
chance
to
look
back
on
our
time
here
we
can
know
that
we
spent
it
well
that
we
made
difference
that
our
fleeting
presence
had
lasting
impact
on
the
lives
of
other
human
beings
this
is
how
ted
kennedy
lived
this
is
his
legacy
he
once
said
of
his
brother
bobby
that
he
need
not
be
or
enlarged
in
death
beyond
what
he
was
in
life
and
imagine
he
would
say
the
same
about
himself
the
greatest
expectations
were
placed
upon
ted
kennedy
shoulders
because
of
who
he
was
but
he
surpassed
them
all
because
of
who
he
became
we
do
not
weep
for
him
today
because
of
the
prestige
attached
to
his
name
or
his
office
we
weep
because
we
loved
this
kind
and
tender
hero
who
persevered
through
pain
and
tragedy
not
for
the
sake
of
ambition
or
vanity
not
for
wealth
or
power
but
only
for
the
people
and
the
country
he
loved
in
the
days
after
september
teddy
made
it
point
to
personally
call
each
one
of
the
families
of
this
state
who
lost
loved
one
in
the
attack
but
he
did
stop
there
he
kept
calling
and
checking
up
on
them
he
fought
through
red
tape
to
get
them
assistance
and
grief
he
invited
them
sailing
played
with
their
children
and
would
write
each
family
letter
whenever
the
anniversary
of
that
terrible
day
came
along
to
one
widow
he
wrote
the
following
as
you
know
so
well
the
passage
of
time
never
really
heals
the
tragic
memory
of
such
great
loss
but
we
carry
on
because
we
have
to
because
our
loved
one
would
want
us
to
and
because
there
is
still
light
to
guide
us
in
the
world
from
the
love
they
gave
us
we
carry
on
ted
kennedy
has
gone
home
now
guided
by
his
faith
and
by
the
light
of
those
he
has
loved
and
lost
at
last
he
is
with
them
once
more
leaving
those
of
us
who
grieve
his
passing
with
the
memories
he
gave
the
good
he
did
the
dream
he
kept
alive
and
single
enduring
image
the
image
of
man
on
boat
white
mane
tousled
smiling
broadly
as
he
sails
into
the
wind
ready
for
what
storms
may
come
carrying
on
toward
some
new
and
wondrous
place
just
beyond
the
horizon
may
god
bless
ted
kennedy
and
may
he
rest
in
eternal
peace

even
better
visiting

this
is
place
where
anyone

with
desire
to
learn
and
to
grow
to
take
their
career
to
new
level
or
start
new
career
altogether

very
difficult
personal

can
take

for

to
take
advantage
of
assistance
for
displaced
workers
he
earned
his
associate
degree
here
at
and

pretty
impressive
might

degree
found
new
job
working
for
the
new
henry
ford
west
hospital
as
maintenance
mechanic
using
the
skills
he
learned
here
and
the
talents
that
he
brought
to
make
fresh
start
there
are
workers
like
who
is
here
today
where
raise
your
hand
where
are
you
there
you
are
there
right
there
is
worker
at
ford
plant
in
sterling
heights
michigan
she
used
to
drive
fork
lift
right
but
then
she
decided
to
train
here
at
for
job
that
required
new
skills
and
now
she
an
apprentice
pipe
fitter
it
telling
example
even
as
this
painful
restructuring
takes
place
in
our
auto
industry
workers
are
seeking
out
training
for
new
auto
jobs
and
and
story
make
clear
what
all
of
you
know
community
colleges
are
an
essential
part
of
our
recovery
in
the
present
and
our
prosperity
in
the
future
this
place
can
make
the
future
better
not
just
for
these
individuals
but
for
america
now
since
this
recession
began
months
ago
million
americans
have
lost
their
jobs
and
do
have
to
tell
you
michigan
in
particular
has
been
now
the
statistics
are
daunting
the
whole
country
now
the
unemployment
rate
is
approaching
percent
here
in
michigan
it
about
five
points
higher
and
new
jobs
of
course
are
going
to
be
coming
out
and
we
going
to
see
continuing
job
loss
even
as
the
economy
is
beginning
to
now
that
not
just
abstractions
those
just
are
numbers
on
page
those
are
extraordinary
hardships
tough
times
for
families
and
individuals
who
worked
hard
all
their
lives
and
have
done
the
right
things
all
their
lives
if
you
have
lost
job
chances
are
you
know
somebody
who
has
family
member
friend
coworker
and
you
know
that
as
difficult
as
the
financial
struggle
can
be
the
sense
of
loss
is
about
more
than
just
because
most
of
us
define
ourselves
by
the
work
we
do
that
part
of
what
it
means
to
be
an
american
we
take
pride
in
work
that
sense
that
you
contributing
supporting
your
family
meeting
your
responsibilities
people
need
work
not
just
for
income
but
because
it
makes
you
part
of
that
fabric
of
community
that
so
important
and
so
when
you
lose
your
job
and
when
entire
communities
are
losing
thousands
of
jobs
that
heavy
burden
that
heavy
weight
now
my
administration
has
job
to
do
as
well
and
that
job
is
to
get
this
economy
back
on
its
feet
that
my
job
and
it
job
gladly
accept
love
these
folks
who
helped
get
us
in
this
mess
and
then
suddenly
say
well
this
is
economy
that
fine
give
it
to
me
my
job
is
to
solve
problems
not
to
stand
on
the
sidelines
and
harp
and
gripe
so
welcome
the
job
want
the
responsibility
and
know
that
let
just
take
an
example
many
questioned
our
efforts
to
help
save
and
from
collapse
earlier
this
year
their
feeling
was
these
companies
were
driven
to
the
brink
by
poor
management
decisions
over
long
period
of
time
and
like
any
business
they
should
be
held
accountable
for
those
decisions
agree
that
they
should
be
held
accountable
but
also
the
historic
significance
and
economic
prominence
of
these
companies
in
communities
all
across
michigan
and
all
across
the
country
thought
about
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
americans
whose
livelihoods
are
still
connected
to
the
american
auto
industry
and
the
impact
on
an
already
struggling
economy
especially
right
here
in
michigan
so
said
that
if
and
were
willing
to
fundamentally
restructure
their
businesses
and
make
the
hard
choices
necessary
to
become
competitive
now
and
in
the
future
it
was
process
worth
supporting
now
today
after
painful
period
of
and
sacrifice
both
and
have
emerged
from
bankruptcy
remember
folks
said
there
was
no
way
they
could
do
it
they
gotten
it
done
already
in
record
time
far
faster
than
anybody
thought
possible
they
got
leaner
structure
they
got
new
management
and
viable
vision
of
how
to
compete
and
win
in
the
century
those
sacrifices
were
shared
among
all
the
stakeholders
workers
and
management
creditors
and
shareholders
and
communities
and
together
they
made
the
rebirth
of
and
possible
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
but
even
with
this
positive
news
the
hard
truth
is
is
that
some
of
the
jobs
that
have
been
lost
in
the
auto
industry
and
elsewhere
be
coming
back
they
the
casualties
of
changing
economy
in
some
cases
just
increased
productivity
in
the
plants
themselves
means
that
some
jobs
are
going
to
return
and
that
only
the
importance
of
generating
new
businesses
and
new
industries
to
replace
the
ones
that
we
lost
and
of
preparing
our
workers
to
fill
the
jobs
they
create
for
even
before
this
recession
hit
we
were
faced
with
an
economy
that
was
simply
not
creating
or
sustaining
enough
new
jobs
so
now
is
the
time
to
change
all
that
what
we
face
is
far
more
than
passing
crisis
this
is
transformative
moment
and
in
this
moment
we
must
do
what
other
generations
have
done
it
not
the
time
to
shrink
from
the
challenges
we
face
or
put
off
tough
decisions
that
what
washington
has
done
for
decades
and
it
exactly
why
ran
for
president
to
change
that
mindset
now
is
the
time
to
build
firmer
stronger
foundation
for
growth
that
will
not
only
withstand
future
economic
storms
but
that
will
help
us
thrive
and
compete
in
global
economy
to
build
that
foundation
we
have
to
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
costs
that
are
driving
us
into
debt
we
going
to
have
to
do
that
and
there
going
to
be
major
debate
over
the
next
three
weeks
and
do
be
fooled
by
folks
trying
to
scare
you
saying
we
change
the
health
care
system
we
have
no
choice
but
to
change
the
health
care
system
because
right
now
it
broken
for
too
many
americans
we
going
to
have
to
make
tough
choices
necessary
to
bring
down
deficits
but
do
let
folks
fool
you
the
best
way
to
start
bringing
down
deficits
is
to
get
control
of
our
health
care
costs
which
is
why
we
need
reform
now
is
the
time
to
create
the
jobs
of
the
future
by
growing
industries
including
new
clean
energy
economy
and
has
been
all
on
top
of
this
as
the
governor
of
michigan
she
is
bring
cleaning
sic
energy
jobs
right
here
to
michigan
and
we
got
to
support
her
in
that
effort
want
michigan
to
build
windmills
and
wind
turbines
and
solar
panels
and
plants
and
light
bulbs
and
all
our
because
michigan
you
know
bad
weather
so
you
can
be
all
on
top
of
you
need
to
know
about
that
in
chicago
too
but
we
also
have
to
ensure
that
we
educating
and
preparing
our
people
for
the
new
jobs
of
the
century
we
got
to
prepare
our
people
with
the
skills
they
need
to
compete
in
this
global
economy
time
and
again
when
we
placed
our
bet
for
the
future
on
education
we
have
prospered
as
result
by
tapping
the
incredible
innovative
and
generative
potential
of
skilled
american
workforce
that
what
happened
when
president
lincoln
signed
into
law
legislation
creating
the
land
grant
colleges
which
not
only
transformed
higher
education
but
also
our
entire
economy
that
what
took
place
when
president
signed
the
bill
which
helped
educate
generation
and
ushered
in
an
era
of
unprecedented
prosperity
that
was
the
foundation
for
the
american
middle
class
and
that
why
at
the
start
of
my
administration
set
goal
for
america
by
this
nation
will
once
again
have
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
we
used
to
have
that
we
going
to
have
it
again
and
we
begun
to
take
historic
steps
to
achieve
this
goal
already
we
increased
grants
by
we
created
tax
credit
for
four
years
of
college
tuition
we
simplified
student
aid
applications
and
ensured
that
aid
is
not
based
on
the
income
of
job
that
you
just
lost
new
bill
of
rights
for
the
century
is
beginning
to
help
soldiers
coming
home
from
iraq
and
to
begin
new
life
in
new
economy
and
the
recovery
plan
has
helped
close
state
budget
shortfalls
which
put
enormous
pressure
on
public
universities
and
community
colleges
at
the
same
time
making
historic
investments
in
school
libraries
and
classrooms
and
facilities
all
across
america
so
we
already
taken
some
steps
that
are
building
the
foundation
for
century
education
system
here
in
america
one
that
will
allow
us
to
compete
with
china
and
india
and
everybody
else
all
around
the
world
but
today
announcing
the
most
significant
down
payment
yet
on
reaching
the
goal
of
having
the
highest
college
graduation
rate
of
any
nation
in
the
world
we
going
to
achieve
this
in
the
next
years
and
it
called
the
american
graduation
initiative
it
will
reform
and
strengthen
community
colleges
like
this
one
from
coast
to
coast
so
they
get
the
resources
that
students
and
schools
need
and
the
results
workers
and
businesses
demand
through
this
plan
we
seek
to
help
an
additional
million
americans
earn
degrees
and
certificates
in
the
next
decade
million
not
since
the
passage
of
the
original
bill
and
the
work
of
president
commission
on
higher
education
which
helped
to
double
the
number
of
community
colleges
and
increase
by
in
those
colleges
have
we
taken
such
historic
step
on
behalf
of
community
colleges
in
america
and
let
me
be
clear
we
pay
for
this
plan
this
is
adding
to
the
deficit
we
paying
for
this
plan
by
ending
the
wasteful
subsidies
we
currently
provide
to
banks
and
private
lenders
for
student
loans
that
will
save
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
over
the
next
years
instead
of
lining
the
pockets
of
special
interests
it
time
this
money
went
towards
the
interests
of
higher
education
in
america
that
what
my
administration
is
committed
to
doing
now
know
that
for
long
time
there
have
been
politicians
who
have
spoken
of
training
as
silver
bullet
and
college
as
it
not
and
we
know
that
tell
you
how
many
workers
who
been
laid
off
you
talk
to
them
about
training
and
they
say
training
for
what
so
understand
the
frustrations
that
lot
of
people
have
especially
if
the
training
is
not
well
designed
for
the
specific
jobs
that
are
being
created
out
there
but
we
know
that
in
the
coming
years
jobs
requiring
at
least
an
associate
degree
are
projected
to
grow
twice
as
fast
as
jobs
requiring
no
college
experience
we
will
not
fill
those
jobs
or
even
keep
those
jobs
here
in
america
without
the
training
offered
by
community
colleges
that
why
want
to
applaud
governor
for
the
no
worker
left
behind
program
it
providing
up
to
two
years
worth
of
free
tuition
at
community
colleges
and
universities
across
the
state
the
rest
of
the
country
should
learn
from
the
effort
this
is
training
to
become
medical
technician
or
health
it
worker
or
lab
specialist
or
nurse
in
fact
percent
of
all
new
nurses
come
from
community
colleges
this
is
training
to
install
solar
panels
and
build
those
wind
turbines
we
were
talking
about
and
develop
smarter
electricity
grid
and
this
is
the
kind
of
education
that
more
and
more
americans
are
using
to
improve
their
skills
and
broaden
their
horizons
many
young
people
are
saving
money
by
spending
two
years
at
community
college
before
heading
to
college
and
more
workers
who
have
lost
their
jobs
or
fear
losing
job
are
seeking
an
edge
at
schools
like
this
one
at
the
same
time
community
colleges
are
under
increasing
pressure
to
cap
and
scrap
courses
and
cut
costs
as
states
and
municipalities
face
budget
shortfalls
and
this
is
in
addition
to
the
challenges
you
face
in
the
best
of
times
as
these
schools
receive
far
less
funding
per
student
than
typical
colleges
and
universities
so
community
colleges
are
an
undervalued
asset
in
our
country
not
only
is
that
not
right
it
not
smart
that
why
asked
who
happens
to
be
relation
of
the
vice
president
but
who
is
also
community
college
educator
for
more
than
years
to
promote
community
colleges
and
help
us
make
community
colleges
stronger
and
that
why
we
putting
in
place
this
american
graduation
initiative
let
me
describe
for
you
the
specifics
of
what
we
going
to
do
number
one
we
will
offer
competitive
grants
challenging
community
colleges
to
pursue
innovative
strategies
in
exchange
for
federal
funding
we
fund
programs
that
connect
students
looking
for
jobs
with
businesses
that
are
looking
to
hire
we
challenge
these
schools
to
find
new
and
better
ways
to
help
students
catch
up
on
the
basics
like
math
and
science
that
are
essential
to
our
competitiveness
we
put
colleges
and
employers
together
to
create
programs
that
match
curricula
in
the
classroom
with
the
needs
of
the
boardroom
these
are
all
kinds
of
there
are
all
kinds
of
examples
of
what
possible
we
seen
for
example
working
with
community
colleges
to
prepare
students
and
workers
for
jobs
ranging
from
work
in
broadband
to
health
it
we
know
that
the
most
successful
community
colleges
are
those
that
partner
with
the
private
sector
so
we
want
to
encourage
more
companies
to
work
with
schools
to
build
these
type
of
relationships
that
way
when
somebody
goes
through
training
program
they
know
that
there
job
at
the
end
of
that
training
we
also
create
new
research
with
simple
mission
to
measure
what
works
and
what
does
all
too
often
we
do
know
what
happens
when
somebody
walks
out
of
classroom
and
onto
the
factory
floor
or
into
the
library
or
the
laboratory
or
the
office
and
that
means
businesses
often
be
sure
what
degree
is
really
worth
and
schools
themselves
do
have
the
facts
to
make
informed
choices
about
which
programs
receive
achieve
results
and
which
programs
do
and
this
is
important
not
just
for
businesses
and
colleges
but
for
students
and
workers
as
well
if
parent
is
going
to
spend
time
in
the
classroom
and
away
from
his
or
her
family
especially
after
long
day
at
work
that
degree
really
has
to
mean
something
they
have
to
know
that
when
they
get
that
degree
this
is
going
to
help
advance
their
goals
if
worker
is
going
to
spend
two
years
training
to
enter
into
whole
new
profession
that
certificate
has
to
mean
that
he
or
she
is
ready
and
that
businesses
are
ready
to
hire
in
addition
we
want
to
propose
new
funding
for
innovative
strategies
that
promote
not
just
in
community
college
program
but
completion
of
that
program
see
more
than
half
more
than
half
of
all
students
who
enter
community
college
to
earn
an
associate
degree
or
transfer
to
school
to
earn
bachelor
degree
unfortunately
fail
to
reach
their
goal
that
not
just
waste
of
valuable
resource
that
tragedy
for
these
students
they
taken
out
debt
and
they
do
get
the
degree
but
they
still
have
to
pay
back
the
debt
and
it
disaster
for
our
economy
so
we
fund
programs
that
track
student
progress
inside
and
outside
the
classroom
let
figure
out
what
keeping
students
from
crossing
that
finish
line
and
then
put
in
place
reforms
that
will
remove
those
barriers
maybe
it
becomes
too
difficult
for
parent
to
be
away
from
home
or
too
expensive
for
waiter
or
nurse
to
miss
shift
maybe
young
student
just
is
sure
if
her
education
will
lead
to
employment
the
point
is
we
need
to
figure
out
solutions
for
these
kinds
of
challenges
because
facing
these
impediments
should
prevent
you
from
reaching
your
potential
all
right
so
that
big
chunk
of
this
first
part
of
this
initiative
the
second
part
we
going
to
back
billion
in
loans
to
renovate
and
rebuild
college
classrooms
and
buildings
all
across
the
country
all
too
often
community
colleges
are
treated
like
the
of
the
higher
education
system
they
an
afterthought
if
they
thought
of
at
all
and
that
means
schools
are
often
years
behind
in
the
facilities
they
provide
which
means
in
century
economy
they
years
behind
in
the
education
they
can
offer
that
mistake
and
it
one
that
we
help
to
correct
through
this
fund
schools
will
have
the
chance
to
borrow
at
more
affordable
rate
to
facilities
and
they
be
building
on
the
funds
in
the
recovery
plan
that
are
already
helping
to
renovate
schools
including
community
colleges
all
across
the
country
and
by
the
way
not
only
does
this
improve
the
schools
and
the
training
that
they
providing
guess
what
you
also
have
to
hire
some
workers
and
some
tradesmen
and
women
to
do
the
work
on
those
schools
so
it
means
it
putting
people
to
work
in
michigan
right
here
right
now
number
three
even
as
we
repair
bricks
and
mortar
we
have
an
opportunity
to
build
new
virtual
infrastructure
to
complement
the
education
and
training
community
colleges
can
offer
so
we
going
to
support
the
creation
of
new
of
courses
so
that
community
colleges
across
the
country
can
offer
more
classes
without
building
more
classrooms
and
this
will
make
big
difference
especially
for
rural
campuses
that
lot
of
times
have
struggled
attract
have
to
struggle
to
attract
students
and
faculty
and
this
will
make
it
possible
for
professor
to
complement
his
lecture
with
an
exercise
or
for
student
who
be
away
from
her
family
to
still
keep
up
with
her
coursework
we
do
know
where
this
kind
of
experiment
will
lead
but
that
exactly
why
we
ought
to
try
it
because
think
there
possibility
that
education
can
provide
especially
for
people
who
are
already
in
the
workforce
and
want
to
retrain
the
chance
to
upgrade
their
skills
without
having
to
quit
their
job
so
let
me
say
this
more
the
road
to
recovery
the
road
to
prosperity
is
going
to
be
hard
it
was
never
going
to
be
easy
when
was
sworn
in
we
were
seeing
thousand
jobs
lost
that
month
then
we
had
the
same
amount
lost
for
two
more
consecutive
months
now
we
got
an
average
of
about
jobs
lost
but
we
still
losing
too
many
jobs
we
will
get
to
the
point
where
we
not
losing
jobs
but
then
we
got
to
start
getting
to
the
point
where
we
actually
creating
jobs
and
it
going
to
take
time
there
are
going
to
be
false
starts
and
there
are
going
to
be
setbacks
but
am
confident
that
we
can
meet
the
challenges
we
face
because
that
what
we
always
done
that
what
america
does
we
hit
some
challenges
we
fuss
and
argue
about
it
and
then
we
go
ahead
and
go
about
the
business
of
solving
our
problems
that
what
we
see
on
display
right
here
at
community
college
that
what
seen
at
colleges
and
universities
all
across
this
country
at
every
juncture
in
our
history
when
we
been
challenged
we
have
summoned
the
resilience
and
the
industriousness
that
american
spirit
that
has
allowed
us
to
succeed
in
the
face
of
even
the
toughest
odds
that
what
we
can
and
must
do
now
not
just
to
overcome
this
crisis
but
to
leave
something
better
behind
to
lay
foundation
on
which
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
can
prosper
and
take
responsibility
for
their
future
just
as
the
students
at
this
school
at
this
difficult
moment
are
taking
responsibility
for
theirs
am
absolutely
confident
that
if
got
your
help
that
we
can
make
it
happen
and
we
are
going
to
see
stronger
more
prosperous
michigan
in
the
years
to
come
thank
you
very
much
warren
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
morning
everybody
before
introduce
america
next
surgeon
general
like
to
say
few
words
about
our
ongoing
efforts
to
reform
the
health
care
system
that
she
will
help
oversee
we
are
now
closer
to
the
goal
of
health
care
reform
than
we
have
ever
been
over
the
last
several
weeks
key
committees
in
the
house
and
the
senate
have
made
important
and
unprecedented
progress
on
plan
that
will
lower
costs
provide
better
care
for
patients
and
curb
the
worst
practices
of
the
insurance
companies
it
plan
that
will
not
add
to
our
deficit
over
the
next
decade
let
me
repeat
that
it
is
plan
that
will
not
add
to
our
deficit
over
the
next
decade
and
eventually
will
help
lower
our
deficit
by
slowing
the
cost
of
and
even
though
we
are
close
got
no
illusions
that
it
going
to
be
easy
to
get
over
the
finish
line
there
are
going
to
be
more
debates
and
more
disagreements
before
all
is
said
and
done
but
health
care
reform
must
be
done
know
there
are
those
who
believe
we
should
wait
to
solve
this
problem
or
take
more
incremental
approach
or
simply
do
nothing
but
this
is
the
kind
of
criticism
we
heard
when
the
country
tried
to
pass
program
that
is
now
providing
quality
care
to
generations
of
american
seniors
it
the
kind
of
criticism
we
heard
when
we
tried
to
pass
the
children
health
insurance
program
which
has
provided
quality
care
and
coverage
to
millions
of
kids
it
the
same
washington
thinking
that
has
ignored
big
challenges
and
put
off
tough
decisions
for
decades
and
it
is
precisely
that
kind
of
small
thinking
that
has
led
us
into
the
current
predicament
so
make
no
mistake
the
status
on
health
care
is
no
longer
an
option
for
the
united
states
of
america
if
we
step
back
from
this
challenge
right
now
we
will
leave
our
children
legacy
of
debt
future
of
crushing
costs
that
bankrupt
our
families
our
businesses
and
because
we
will
have
done
nothing
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
and
will
crush
our
government
premiums
will
continue
to
placing
what
amounts
to
another
tax
on
american
families
struggling
to
pay
bills
the
insurance
companies
and
special
interests
that
have
killed
reform
in
the
past
will
only
continue
to
benefit
even
more
and
they
continue
to
deny
coverage
to
americans
with
medical
conditions
people
will
continue
to
lose
health
insurance
just
because
they
lose
their
job
or
they
change
jobs
this
is
future
that
we
can
not
afford
this
country
afford
to
have
health
care
premiums
rise
three
times
faster
than
people
wages
as
they
did
over
the
last
decade
we
afford
americans
losing
their
health
care
every
single
day
we
afford
future
where
our
government
will
eventually
spend
more
on
and
than
what
we
spend
on
everything
else
and
during
the
campaign
promised
health
care
reform
that
would
control
costs
expand
coverage
and
ensure
choice
and
promised
that
americans
making
year
or
less
would
not
pay
more
in
taxes
these
are
promises
that
we
keeping
as
reform
moves
forward
this
is
no
longer
problem
we
can
wait
to
fix
this
is
about
who
we
are
as
country
health
care
reform
is
about
every
family
health
but
it
also
about
the
health
of
the
economy
so
just
want
to
put
everybody
on
notice
because
there
was
lot
of
chatter
during
the
week
that
was
gone
we
are
going
to
get
this
done
inaction
is
not
an
option
and
for
those
and
cynics
who
think
that
this
is
not
going
to
happen
do
bet
against
us
we
are
going
to
make
this
thing
happen
because
the
american
people
desperately
need
it
and
even
those
who
are
satisfied
with
their
health
care
right
now
they
understand
that
if
premiums
keep
on
doubling
and
if
employers
keep
on
shedding
health
insurance
because
it
unsustainable
and
if
you
look
at
the
trajectory
of
where
and
are
going
then
inaction
will
create
the
biggest
crisis
of
all
and
so
understand
people
are
little
nervous
and
little
scared
about
making
change
the
muscles
in
this
town
to
bring
about
big
changes
are
little
atrophied
but
we
whipping
folks
back
into
shape
we
are
going
to
get
this
done
and
if
there
anyone
who
understands
the
urgency
of
meeting
this
challenge
in
personal
and
powerful
way
it
the
woman
who
will
become
our
nation
next
surgeon
general
regina
benjamin
the
list
of
qualifications
that
make
benjamin
an
outstanding
candidate
to
be
america
leading
spokesperson
on
issues
of
public
health
are
long
indeed
she
was
in
the
second
class
at
school
of
medicine
and
went
on
to
earn
an
from
the
university
of
alabama
at
and
an
from
she
served
as
associate
dean
for
rural
health
at
the
university
of
south
alabama
college
of
medicine
and
in
she
became
the
first
physician
under
and
the
first
african
american
woman
to
be
named
to
the
american
medical
association
board
of
trustees
in
she
became
president
of
alabama
state
medical
association
and
she
has
received
numerous
awards
and
recognitions
including
the
genius
award
it
very
impressive
but
of
all
these
achievements
and
experience
none
has
been
more
pertinent
to
today
challenges
or
closer
to
regina
heart
than
the
rural
health
clinic
that
she
has
built
and
rebuilt
in
did
say
that
right
well
tell
me
how
to
say
it
benjamin
the
president
that
in
alabama
people
is
rural
town
of
about
people
it
town
where
lot
of
folks
work
for
themselves
scrape
by
and
usually
afford
health
insurance
and
by
the
way
benjamin
while
we
were
talking
in
the
oval
office
described
for
me
the
demographics
of
this
town
are
actually
very
interesting
because
you
got
whites
blacks
and
asians
in
this
community
there
are
lot
of
and
who
have
moved
there
and
are
part
of
this
town
so
it
diverse
but
very
poor
rural
community
and
like
so
many
other
rural
communities
doctors
and
hospitals
are
hard
to
come
by
and
that
why
even
though
she
could
have
left
the
state
to
make
more
money
as
specialist
or
as
doctor
in
wealthier
community
regina
benjamin
returned
to
alabama
and
opened
small
clinic
in
when
people
could
pay
she
did
charge
them
when
the
clinic
was
making
money
she
did
take
salary
for
herself
when
hurricane
george
destroyed
the
clinic
in
she
made
house
calls
to
all
her
patients
while
it
was
rebuilt
when
hurricane
destroyed
it
again
and
left
most
of
her
town
homeless
she
mortgaged
her
house
and
out
her
credit
cards
to
rebuild
that
clinic
for
second
time
she
tended
to
those
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
storm
and
when
folks
needed
medicine
she
asked
the
pharmacist
to
send
the
bill
her
way
and
when
regina
clinic
was
about
to
open
for
the
third
time
and
fire
burned
it
to
the
ground
before
it
could
serve
the
first
patient
well
you
can
guess
what
benjamin
did
with
help
from
her
community
she
is
rebuilding
it
again
one
disabled
patient
brought
her
an
envelope
with
inside
another
elderly
man
said
simply
maybe
can
help
got
hammer
for
nearly
two
decades
regina
benjamin
has
seen
in
very
personal
way
what
is
broken
about
our
health
care
system
she
seen
an
increasing
number
of
patients
who
had
health
insurance
their
entire
lives
suddenly
lose
it
because
they
lost
their
jobs
or
because
it
simply
become
too
expensive
she
been
relentless
promoter
of
prevention
and
programs
having
treated
too
many
costly
and
diseases
and
complications
that
did
have
to
happen
and
she
witnessed
the
shortage
of
primary
care
physicians
in
the
rural
and
areas
where
she
works
but
for
all
that
she
seen
and
all
the
tremendous
obstacles
that
she
has
overcome
regina
benjamin
also
represents
what
best
about
health
care
in
america
doctors
and
nurses
who
give
and
care
and
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
their
patients
those
americans
who
would
do
anything
to
heal
fellow
citizen
through
floods
and
fires
and
severe
want
regina
benjamin
has
refused
to
give
up
her
patients
have
refused
to
give
up
and
when
we
were
talking
in
the
oval
office
she
said
the
one
thing
want
to
do
is
make
sure
that
this
surgeon
general
office
gives
voice
to
patients
that
patients
have
seat
at
the
table
somebody
is
advocating
for
them
and
speaking
for
them
and
now
we
in
washington
and
across
america
have
to
refuse
to
give
up
on
the
goal
of
health
care
that
is
affordable
and
accessible
for
every
last
one
of
us
we
do
have
to
deal
with
hurricanes
and
we
do
have
to
deal
with
floods
and
we
do
have
to
deal
with
fires
all
we
have
to
do
is
pass
bill
to
make
sure
that
the
american
people
have
decent
shot
at
getting
the
kind
of
choice
and
health
care
that
affordable
and
know
that
benjamin
is
going
to
help
us
get
there
as
the
next
surgeon
general
and
am
truly
to
nominate
her
for
that
post
and
secretary
is
equally
excited
even
though
she
just
standing
here
with
that
let
me
introduce
the
next
surgeon
general
of
the
united
states
regina
benjamin
good
morning
it
is
great
for
me
to
join
you
at
the
new
economic
school
and
are
so
pleased
to
be
in
moscow
and
as
somebody
who
was
born
in
hawaii
glad
to
be
here
in
july
instead
of
january
know
that
is
young
school
but
speak
to
you
today
with
deep
respect
for
russia
timeless
heritage
russian
writers
have
helped
us
understand
the
complexity
of
the
human
experience
and
eternal
truths
russian
painters
composers
and
dancers
have
introduced
us
to
new
forms
of
beauty
russian
scientists
have
cured
disease
sought
new
frontiers
of
progress
and
helped
us
go
to
space
these
are
contributions
that
are
not
contained
by
russia
borders
as
vast
as
those
borders
are
indeed
russia
heritage
has
touched
every
corner
of
the
world
and
speaks
to
the
humanity
that
we
share
that
includes
my
own
country
which
has
been
blessed
with
russian
immigrants
for
decades
we
been
enriched
by
russian
culture
and
enhanced
by
russian
cooperation
and
as
resident
of
washington
continue
to
benefit
from
the
contributions
of
specifically
from
we
very
pleased
to
have
him
in
washington
here
at
you
have
inherited
this
great
cultural
legacy
but
your
focus
on
economics
is
no
less
fundamental
to
the
future
of
humanity
as
said
inspiration
is
needed
in
geometry
just
as
much
as
poetry
and
today
want
particularly
to
speak
to
those
of
you
preparing
to
graduate
you
poised
to
be
leaders
in
academia
and
industry
in
finance
and
government
but
before
you
move
forward
it
worth
reflecting
on
what
has
already
taken
place
during
your
young
lives
like
president
and
myself
you
not
old
enough
to
have
witnessed
the
darkest
hours
of
the
cold
war
when
hydrogen
bombs
were
tested
in
the
atmosphere
and
children
drilled
in
fallout
shelters
and
we
reached
the
brink
of
nuclear
catastrophe
but
you
are
the
last
generation
born
when
the
world
was
divided
at
that
time
the
american
and
soviet
armies
were
still
massed
in
europe
trained
and
ready
to
fight
the
ideological
trenches
of
the
last
century
were
roughly
in
place
competition
in
everything
from
astrophysics
to
athletics
was
treated
as
game
if
one
person
won
then
the
other
person
had
to
lose
and
then
within
few
short
years
the
world
as
it
was
ceased
to
be
now
make
no
mistake
this
change
did
not
come
from
any
one
nation
the
cold
war
reached
conclusion
because
of
the
actions
of
many
nations
over
many
years
and
because
the
people
of
russia
and
eastern
europe
stood
up
and
decided
that
its
end
would
be
peaceful
with
the
end
of
the
cold
war
there
were
extraordinary
expectations
for
peace
and
for
prosperity
for
new
arrangements
among
nations
and
new
opportunities
for
individuals
like
all
periods
of
great
change
it
was
time
of
ambitious
plans
and
endless
possibilities
but
of
course
things
do
always
work
out
exactly
as
planned
back
in
shortly
after
this
school
opened
one
student
summed
up
the
difficulty
of
change
when
he
told
reporter
and
quote
him
the
real
world
is
not
so
rational
as
on
paper
the
real
world
is
not
so
rational
as
on
paper
over
two
tumultuous
decades
that
truth
has
been
borne
out
around
the
world
great
wealth
has
been
created
but
it
has
not
eliminated
vast
pockets
of
crushing
poverty
poverty
exists
here
it
exists
in
the
united
states
and
it
exists
all
around
the
world
more
people
have
gone
to
the
ballot
box
but
too
many
governments
still
fail
to
protect
the
rights
of
their
people
ideological
struggles
have
diminished
but
they
been
replaced
by
conflicts
over
tribe
and
ethnicity
and
religion
human
being
with
computer
can
hold
the
same
amount
of
information
stored
in
the
russian
state
library
but
that
technology
can
also
be
used
to
do
great
harm
in
new
russia
the
disappearance
of
old
political
and
economic
restrictions
after
the
end
of
the
soviet
union
brought
both
opportunity
and
hardship
few
prospered
but
many
more
did
not
there
were
tough
times
but
the
russian
people
showed
strength
and
made
sacrifices
and
you
achieved
progress
through
growing
economy
and
greater
confidence
and
despite
painful
times
many
in
eastern
europe
and
russia
are
much
better
off
today
than
years
ago
we
see
that
progress
here
at
school
founded
with
western
support
that
is
now
distinctly
russian
place
of
learning
and
inquiry
where
the
test
of
an
idea
is
not
whether
it
is
russian
or
american
or
european
but
whether
it
works
above
all
we
see
that
progress
in
all
of
you
young
people
with
young
century
to
shape
as
you
see
fit
your
lifetime
coincides
with
this
era
of
transition
but
think
about
the
fundamental
questions
asked
when
this
school
was
founded
what
kind
of
future
is
russia
going
to
have
what
kind
of
future
are
russia
and
america
going
to
have
together
what
world
order
will
replace
the
cold
war
those
questions
still
do
have
clear
answers
and
so
now
they
must
be
answered
by
you
by
your
generation
in
russia
in
america
and
around
the
world
you
get
to
decide
and
while
can
not
answer
those
questions
for
you
can
speak
plainly
about
the
future
that
america
is
seeking
to
begin
with
let
me
be
clear
america
wants
strong
peaceful
and
prosperous
russia
this
belief
is
rooted
in
our
respect
for
the
russian
people
and
shared
history
between
our
nations
that
goes
beyond
competition
despite
our
past
rivalry
our
people
were
allies
in
the
greatest
struggle
of
the
last
century
recently
noted
this
when
was
in
normandy
for
just
as
men
from
boston
and
risked
all
that
they
had
to
storm
those
beaches
and
scale
those
cliffs
soviet
soldiers
from
places
like
and
kiev
endured
unimaginable
hardships
to
repeal
to
repel
an
invasion
and
turn
the
tide
in
the
east
as
president
john
kennedy
said
no
nation
in
history
of
battle
ever
suffered
more
than
the
soviet
union
in
the
second
world
war
so
as
we
this
past
we
also
the
future
benefit
that
will
come
from
strong
and
vibrant
russia
think
of
the
issues
that
will
define
your
lives
security
from
nuclear
weapons
and
extremism
access
to
markets
and
opportunity
health
and
the
environment
an
international
system
that
protects
sovereignty
and
human
rights
while
promoting
stability
and
prosperity
these
challenges
demand
global
partnership
and
that
partnership
will
be
stronger
if
russia
occupies
its
rightful
place
as
great
power
yet
unfortunately
there
is
sometimes
sense
that
old
assumptions
must
prevail
old
ways
of
thinking
conception
of
power
that
is
rooted
in
the
past
rather
than
in
the
future
there
is
the
century
view
that
the
united
states
and
russia
are
destined
to
be
antagonists
and
that
strong
russia
or
strong
america
can
only
assert
themselves
in
opposition
to
one
another
and
there
is
century
view
that
we
are
destined
to
vie
for
spheres
of
influence
and
that
great
powers
must
forge
competing
blocs
to
balance
one
another
these
assumptions
are
wrong
in
great
power
does
not
show
strength
by
dominating
or
other
countries
the
days
when
empires
could
treat
sovereign
states
as
pieces
on
chess
board
are
over
as
said
in
cairo
given
our
independence
any
world
order
that
given
our
interdependence
any
world
order
that
tries
to
elevate
one
nation
or
one
group
of
people
over
another
will
inevitably
fail
the
pursuit
of
power
is
no
longer
game
progress
must
be
shared
that
why
have
called
for
reset
in
relations
between
the
united
states
and
russia
this
must
be
more
than
fresh
start
between
the
kremlin
and
the
white
house
though
that
is
important
and
had
excellent
discussions
with
both
your
president
and
your
prime
minister
it
must
be
sustained
effort
among
the
american
and
russian
people
to
identify
mutual
interests
and
expand
dialogue
and
cooperation
that
can
pave
the
way
to
progress
this
will
not
be
easy
it
difficult
to
forge
lasting
partnership
between
former
adversaries
it
hard
to
change
habits
that
have
been
ingrained
in
our
governments
and
our
bureaucracies
for
decades
but
believe
that
on
the
fundamental
issues
that
will
shape
this
century
americans
and
share
common
interests
that
form
basis
for
cooperation
it
is
not
for
me
to
define
russia
national
interests
but
can
tell
you
about
america
national
interests
and
believe
that
you
will
see
that
we
share
common
ground
first
america
has
an
interest
in
reversing
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
preventing
their
use
in
the
last
century
generations
of
americans
and
inherited
the
power
to
destroy
nations
and
the
understanding
that
using
that
power
would
bring
about
our
own
destruction
in
our
inheritance
is
different
you
and
do
have
to
ask
whether
american
and
russian
leaders
will
respect
balance
of
terror
we
understand
the
horrific
consequences
of
any
war
between
our
two
countries
but
we
do
have
to
ask
this
question
we
have
to
ask
whether
extremists
who
have
killed
innocent
civilians
in
new
york
and
in
moscow
will
show
that
same
restraint
we
have
to
ask
whether
or
or
nations
will
protect
their
arsenals
and
refrain
from
using
them
this
is
the
core
of
the
nuclear
challenge
in
the
century
the
notion
that
prestige
comes
from
holding
these
weapons
or
that
we
can
protect
ourselves
by
picking
and
choosing
which
nations
can
have
these
weapons
is
an
illusion
in
the
short
period
since
the
end
of
the
cold
war
we
already
seen
india
pakistan
and
north
korea
conduct
nuclear
tests
without
fundamental
change
do
any
of
us
truly
believe
that
the
next
two
decades
will
not
bring
about
the
further
spread
of
these
nuclear
weapons
that
why
america
is
committed
to
stopping
nuclear
proliferation
and
ultimately
seeking
world
without
nuclear
weapons
that
is
consistent
with
our
commitment
under
the
nuclear
treaty
that
is
our
responsibility
as
the
world
two
leading
nuclear
powers
and
while
know
this
goal
be
met
soon
pursuing
it
provides
the
legal
and
moral
foundation
to
prevent
the
proliferation
and
eventual
use
of
nuclear
weapons
we
already
taking
important
steps
to
build
this
foundation
yesterday
president
and
made
progress
on
negotiating
new
treaty
that
will
substantially
reduce
our
warheads
and
delivery
systems
we
renewed
our
commitment
to
clean
safe
and
peaceful
nuclear
energy
which
must
be
right
for
all
nations
that
live
up
to
their
responsibilities
under
the
and
we
agreed
to
increase
cooperation
on
nuclear
security
which
is
essential
to
achieving
the
goal
of
securing
all
vulnerable
nuclear
material
within
four
years
as
we
keep
our
own
commitments
we
must
hold
other
nations
accountable
for
theirs
whether
america
or
russia
neither
of
us
would
benefit
from
nuclear
arms
race
in
east
asia
or
the
middle
east
that
why
we
should
be
united
in
opposing
north
korea
efforts
to
become
nuclear
power
and
opposing
iran
efforts
to
acquire
nuclear
weapon
and
pleased
that
president
and
agreed
upon
joint
threat
assessment
of
the
ballistic
challenges
ballistic
missile
challenges
of
the
century
including
from
iran
and
north
korea
this
is
not
about
out
individual
nations
it
about
the
responsibilities
of
all
nations
if
we
fail
to
stand
together
then
the
and
the
security
council
will
lose
credibility
and
international
law
will
give
way
to
the
law
of
the
jungle
and
that
benefits
no
one
as
said
in
prague
rules
must
be
binding
violations
must
be
punished
and
words
must
mean
something
the
successful
enforcement
of
these
rules
will
remove
causes
of
disagreement
know
russia
opposes
the
planned
configuration
for
missile
in
europe
and
my
administration
is
reviewing
these
plans
to
enhance
the
security
of
america
europe
and
the
world
and
made
it
clear
that
this
system
is
directed
at
preventing
potential
attack
from
iran
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
russia
in
fact
want
to
work
together
with
russia
on
missile
architecture
that
makes
us
all
safer
but
if
the
threat
from
iran
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
program
is
eliminated
the
driving
force
for
missile
in
europe
will
be
eliminated
and
that
is
in
our
mutual
interests
now
in
addition
to
securing
the
world
most
dangerous
weapons
second
area
where
america
has
critical
national
interest
is
in
isolating
and
defeating
violent
extremists
for
years
and
its
affiliates
have
defiled
great
religion
of
peace
and
justice
and
ruthlessly
murdered
men
women
and
children
of
all
nationalities
and
faiths
indeed
above
all
they
have
murdered
muslims
and
these
extremists
have
killed
in
amman
and
bali
and
and
they
have
the
blood
of
americans
and
on
their
hands
they
plotting
to
kill
more
of
our
people
and
they
benefit
from
safe
havens
that
allow
them
to
train
and
operate
particularly
along
the
border
of
pakistan
and
and
that
why
america
has
clear
goal
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
and
its
allies
in
and
pakistan
we
seek
no
bases
nor
do
we
want
to
control
these
nations
instead
we
want
to
work
with
international
partners
including
russia
to
help
afghans
and
advance
their
own
security
and
prosperity
and
that
why
pleased
that
russia
has
agreed
to
allow
the
united
states
to
supply
our
coalition
forces
through
your
territory
neither
america
nor
russia
has
an
interest
in
an
or
pakistan
governed
by
the
it
time
to
work
together
on
behalf
of
different
future
future
in
which
we
leave
behind
the
great
game
of
the
past
and
the
conflict
of
the
present
future
in
which
all
of
us
contribute
to
the
security
of
central
asia
now
beyond
america
is
committed
to
promoting
the
opportunity
that
will
isolate
extremists
we
are
helping
the
iraqi
people
build
better
future
and
leaving
iraq
to
the
iraqis
we
pursuing
the
goal
of
two
states
israel
and
living
in
peace
and
security
we
partnering
with
muslim
communities
around
the
world
to
advance
education
health
and
economic
development
in
each
of
these
believe
that
the
russian
people
share
our
goals
and
will
benefit
from
success
and
we
need
to
partner
together
now
in
addition
to
these
security
concerns
the
third
area
that
will
discuss
is
america
interest
in
global
prosperity
and
since
we
have
so
many
economists
and
future
businessmen
and
women
in
the
room
know
this
is
of
great
interest
to
you
we
meet
in
the
midst
of
the
worst
global
recession
in
generation
believe
that
the
free
market
is
the
greatest
force
for
creating
and
distributing
wealth
that
the
world
has
known
but
wherever
the
market
is
allowed
to
run
rampant
through
excessive
lack
of
regulation
or
corruption
then
all
are
endangered
whether
we
live
on
the
or
on
the
volga
in
america
we
now
taking
unprecedented
steps
to
jumpstart
our
economy
and
reform
our
system
of
regulation
but
just
as
no
nation
can
wall
itself
off
from
the
consequences
of
global
crisis
no
one
can
serve
as
the
sole
engine
of
global
growth
you
see
during
your
lives
something
fundamental
has
changed
and
while
this
crisis
has
shown
us
the
risks
that
come
with
change
that
risk
is
overwhelmed
by
opportunity
think
of
what
possible
today
that
was
unthinkable
two
decades
ago
young
woman
with
an
internet
connection
in
india
can
compete
with
anybody
anywhere
in
the
world
an
entrepreneur
with
company
in
beijing
can
take
his
business
global
an
professor
in
moscow
can
collaborate
with
colleagues
at
harvard
or
that
good
for
all
of
us
because
when
prosperity
is
created
in
india
that
new
market
for
our
goods
when
new
ideas
take
hold
in
china
that
pushes
our
businesses
to
innovate
when
new
connections
are
forged
among
people
all
of
us
are
enriched
there
is
extraordinary
potential
for
increased
cooperation
between
americans
and
we
can
pursue
trade
that
is
free
and
fair
and
integrated
with
the
wider
world
we
can
boost
investment
that
creates
jobs
in
both
our
countries
we
can
forge
partnerships
on
energy
that
tap
not
only
traditional
resources
like
oil
and
gas
but
new
sources
of
energy
that
will
drive
growth
and
combat
climate
change
all
of
that
americans
and
can
do
together
now
government
can
promote
this
cooperation
but
ultimately
individuals
must
advance
this
cooperation
because
the
greatest
resource
of
any
nation
in
the
century
is
you
it
people
it
young
people
especially
and
the
country
which
taps
that
resource
will
be
the
country
that
will
succeed
that
success
depends
upon
economies
that
function
within
the
rule
of
law
as
president
has
rightly
said
mature
and
effective
legal
system
is
condition
for
sustained
economic
development
people
everywhere
should
have
the
right
to
do
business
or
get
an
education
without
paying
bribe
whether
they
are
in
america
or
russia
or
africa
or
latin
america
that
not
american
idea
or
russian
idea
that
how
people
and
countries
will
succeed
in
the
century
and
this
brings
me
to
the
fourth
issue
that
will
discuss
america
interest
in
democratic
governments
that
protect
the
rights
of
their
people
by
no
means
is
america
perfect
but
it
is
our
commitment
to
certain
universal
values
which
allows
us
to
correct
our
imperfections
to
improve
constantly
and
to
grow
stronger
over
time
freedom
of
and
assembly
has
allowed
women
and
minorities
and
workers
to
protest
for
full
and
equal
rights
at
time
when
they
were
denied
the
rule
of
law
and
equal
administration
of
justice
has
busted
monopolies
shut
down
political
machines
that
were
corrupt
ended
abuses
of
power
independent
media
have
exposed
corruption
at
all
levels
of
business
and
government
competitive
elections
allow
us
to
change
course
and
hold
our
leaders
accountable
if
our
democracy
did
not
advance
those
rights
then
as
person
of
african
ancestry
would
be
able
to
address
you
as
an
american
citizen
much
less
president
because
at
the
time
of
our
founding
had
no
rights
people
who
looked
like
me
but
it
is
because
of
that
process
that
can
now
stand
before
you
as
president
of
the
united
states
so
around
the
world
america
supports
these
values
because
they
are
moral
but
also
because
they
work
the
arc
of
history
shows
that
governments
which
serve
their
own
people
survive
and
thrive
governments
which
serve
only
their
own
power
do
not
governments
that
represent
the
will
of
their
people
are
far
less
likely
to
descend
into
failed
states
to
their
citizens
or
to
wage
war
on
others
governments
that
promote
the
rule
of
law
subject
their
actions
to
oversight
and
allow
for
independent
institutions
are
more
dependable
trading
partners
and
in
our
own
history
democracies
have
been
america
most
enduring
allies
including
those
we
once
waged
war
with
in
europe
and
asia
nations
that
today
live
with
great
security
and
prosperity
now
let
me
be
clear
america
can
not
and
should
not
seek
to
impose
any
system
of
government
on
any
other
country
nor
would
we
presume
to
choose
which
party
or
individual
should
run
country
and
we
have
always
done
what
we
should
have
on
that
front
even
as
we
meet
here
today
america
supports
now
the
restoration
of
the
president
of
even
though
he
has
strongly
opposed
american
policies
we
do
so
not
because
we
agree
with
him
we
do
so
because
we
respect
the
universal
principle
that
people
should
choose
their
own
leaders
whether
they
are
leaders
we
agree
with
or
not
and
that
leads
me
to
the
final
area
that
will
discuss
which
is
america
interest
in
an
international
system
that
advances
cooperation
while
respecting
the
sovereignty
of
all
nations
state
sovereignty
must
be
cornerstone
of
international
order
just
as
all
states
should
have
the
right
to
choose
their
leaders
states
must
have
the
right
to
borders
that
are
secure
and
to
their
own
foreign
policies
that
is
true
for
russia
just
as
it
is
true
for
the
united
states
any
system
that
those
rights
will
lead
to
anarchy
that
why
we
must
apply
this
principle
to
all
nations
and
that
includes
nations
like
georgia
and
ukraine
america
will
never
impose
security
arrangement
on
another
country
for
any
country
to
become
member
of
an
like
nato
for
example
majority
of
its
people
must
choose
to
they
must
undertake
reforms
they
must
be
able
to
contribute
to
the
alliance
mission
and
let
me
be
clear
nato
should
be
seeking
collaboration
with
russia
not
confrontation
and
more
broadly
we
need
to
foster
cooperation
and
respect
among
all
nations
and
peoples
as
president
of
the
united
states
will
work
tirelessly
to
protect
america
security
and
to
advance
our
interests
but
no
one
nation
can
meet
the
challenges
of
the
century
on
its
own
nor
dictate
its
terms
to
the
world
that
is
something
that
america
now
understands
just
as
russia
understands
that
why
america
seeks
an
international
system
that
lets
nations
pursue
their
interests
peacefully
especially
when
those
interests
diverge
system
where
the
universal
rights
of
human
beings
are
respected
and
violations
of
those
rights
are
opposed
system
where
we
hold
ourselves
to
the
same
standards
that
we
apply
to
other
nations
with
clear
rights
and
responsibilities
for
all
there
was
time
when
and
stalin
could
shape
the
world
in
one
meeting
those
days
are
over
the
world
is
more
complex
today
billions
of
people
have
found
their
voice
and
seek
their
own
measure
of
prosperity
and
in
every
corner
of
the
planet
over
the
past
two
decades
we
witnessed
markets
grow
wealth
spread
and
technology
used
to
build
not
destroy
we
seen
old
hatreds
pass
illusions
of
differences
between
people
lift
and
fade
away
we
seen
the
human
destiny
in
the
hands
of
more
and
more
human
beings
who
can
shape
their
own
destinies
now
we
must
see
that
the
period
of
transition
which
you
have
lived
through
ushers
in
new
era
in
which
nations
live
in
peace
and
people
their
aspirations
for
dignity
security
and
better
life
for
their
children
that
is
america
interest
and
believe
that
it
is
russia
interest
as
well
know
that
this
future
can
seem
distant
change
is
hard
in
the
words
of
that
student
back
in
the
real
world
is
not
so
rational
as
on
paper
but
think
of
the
change
that
has
unfolded
with
the
passing
of
time
one
hundred
years
ago
czar
ruled
russia
and
europe
was
place
of
empire
when
was
born
segregation
was
still
the
law
of
the
land
in
parts
of
america
and
my
father
kenya
was
still
colony
when
you
were
born
school
like
this
would
have
been
impossible
and
the
internet
was
only
known
to
privileged
few
you
get
to
decide
what
comes
next
you
get
to
choose
where
change
will
take
us
because
the
future
does
not
belong
to
those
who
gather
armies
on
field
of
battle
or
bury
missiles
in
the
ground
the
future
belongs
to
young
people
with
an
education
and
the
imagination
to
create
that
is
the
source
of
power
in
this
century
and
given
all
that
has
happened
in
your
two
decades
on
earth
just
imagine
what
you
can
create
in
the
years
to
come
every
country
charts
its
own
course
russia
has
cut
its
way
through
time
like
mighty
river
through
canyon
leaving
an
indelible
mark
on
human
history
as
it
goes
as
you
move
this
story
forward
look
to
the
future
that
can
be
built
if
we
refuse
to
be
burdened
by
the
old
obstacles
and
old
suspicions
look
to
the
future
that
can
be
built
if
we
partner
on
behalf
of
the
aspirations
we
hold
in
common
together
we
can
build
world
where
people
are
protected
prosperity
is
enlarged
and
our
power
truly
serves
progress
and
it
is
all
in
your
hands
good
luck
to
all
of
you
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
today
want
to
start
by
addressing
three
issues
and
then
take
your
questions
first
like
to
say
few
words
about
the
situation
in
iran
the
united
states
and
the
international
community
have
been
appalled
and
outraged
by
the
threats
the
beatings
and
imprisonments
of
the
last
few
days
strongly
condemn
these
unjust
actions
and
join
with
the
american
people
in
mourning
each
and
every
innocent
life
that
is
lost
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
respects
the
sovereignty
of
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
and
is
not
interfering
with
iran
affairs
but
we
must
also
bear
witness
to
the
courage
and
the
dignity
of
the
iranian
people
and
to
remarkable
opening
within
iranian
society
and
we
deplore
the
violence
against
innocent
civilians
anywhere
that
it
takes
place
the
iranian
people
are
trying
to
have
debate
about
their
future
some
in
iran
some
in
the
iranian
government
in
particular
are
trying
to
avoid
that
debate
by
accusing
the
united
states
and
others
in
the
west
of
instigating
protests
over
the
election
these
accusations
are
patently
false
they
an
obvious
attempt
to
distract
people
from
what
is
truly
taking
place
within
iran
borders
this
tired
strategy
of
using
old
tensions
to
scapegoat
other
countries
work
anymore
in
iran
this
is
not
about
the
united
states
or
the
west
this
is
about
the
people
of
iran
and
the
future
that
they
and
only
they
will
choose
the
iranian
people
can
speak
for
themselves
that
precisely
what
happened
in
the
last
few
days
in
no
iron
fist
is
strong
enough
to
shut
off
the
world
from
bearing
witness
to
peaceful
protests
of
justice
despite
the
iranian
government
efforts
to
expel
journalists
and
isolate
itself
powerful
images
and
poignant
words
have
made
their
way
to
us
through
cell
phones
and
computers
and
so
we
watched
what
the
iranian
people
are
doing
this
is
what
we
witnessed
we
seen
the
timeless
dignity
of
tens
of
thousands
of
iranians
marching
in
silence
we
seen
people
of
all
ages
risk
everything
to
insist
that
their
votes
are
counted
and
that
their
voices
are
heard
above
all
we
seen
courageous
women
stand
up
to
the
brutality
and
threats
and
we
experienced
the
searing
image
of
woman
bleeding
to
death
on
the
streets
while
this
loss
is
raw
and
extraordinarily
painful
we
also
know
this
those
who
stand
up
for
justice
are
always
on
the
right
side
of
history
as
said
in
cairo
suppressing
ideas
never
succeeds
in
making
them
go
away
the
iranian
people
have
universal
right
to
assembly
and
free
if
the
iranian
government
seeks
the
respect
of
the
international
community
it
must
respect
those
rights
and
heed
the
will
of
its
own
people
it
must
govern
through
consent
and
not
coercion
that
what
iran
own
people
are
calling
for
and
the
iranian
people
will
ultimately
judge
the
actions
of
their
own
government
thank
you
so
much
please
everybody
be
seated
thank
you
very
much
you
very
kind
thank
you
let
me
begin
by
thanking
for
the
wonderful
introduction
want
to
thank
joseph
the
chair
of
the
board
of
trustees
as
well
as
lazarus
speaker
of
house
of
delegates
thanks
to
all
of
you
for
bringing
me
home
even
if
it
just
for
day
from
the
moment
took
office
as
president
the
central
challenge
we
confronted
as
nation
has
been
the
need
to
lift
ourselves
out
of
the
worst
recession
since
world
war
in
recent
months
we
taken
series
of
extraordinary
steps
not
just
to
repair
the
immediate
damage
to
our
economy
but
to
build
new
foundation
for
lasting
and
sustained
growth
we
here
to
create
new
jobs
to
unfreeze
our
credit
markets
we
stemming
the
loss
of
homes
and
the
decline
of
home
values
all
this
is
important
but
even
as
we
made
progress
we
know
that
the
road
to
prosperity
remains
long
and
it
remains
difficult
and
we
also
know
that
one
essential
step
on
our
journey
is
to
control
the
cost
of
health
care
in
america
and
in
order
to
do
that
we
going
to
need
the
help
of
the
today
we
are
spending
over
trillion
year
on
health
care
almost
percent
more
per
person
than
the
next
most
costly
nation
and
yet
as
think
many
of
you
are
aware
for
all
of
this
spending
more
of
our
citizens
are
uninsured
the
quality
of
our
care
is
often
lower
and
we
are
any
healthier
in
fact
citizens
in
some
countries
that
spend
substantially
less
than
we
do
are
actually
living
longer
than
we
do
make
no
mistake
the
cost
of
our
health
care
is
threat
to
our
economy
it
an
escalating
burden
on
our
families
and
businesses
it
ticking
time
bomb
for
the
federal
budget
and
it
is
unsustainable
for
the
united
states
of
america
it
unsustainable
for
americans
like
young
mother
that
met
in
just
last
week
who
learned
that
the
breast
cancer
she
thought
she
beaten
had
spread
to
her
bones
but
who
now
being
forced
to
spend
time
worrying
about
how
to
cover
the
in
medical
debts
she
already
accumulated
worried
about
future
debts
that
she
going
to
accumulate
when
all
she
wants
to
do
is
spend
time
with
her
two
children
and
focus
on
getting
well
these
are
not
the
worries
that
woman
like
should
have
to
face
in
nation
as
wealthy
as
ours
stories
like
are
being
told
by
women
and
men
all
across
this
country
by
families
who
seen
costs
soar
and
premiums
double
over
the
last
decade
at
rate
three
times
faster
than
wages
this
is
forcing
americans
of
all
ages
to
go
without
the
checkups
or
the
prescriptions
they
need
that
you
know
they
need
it
creating
situation
where
single
illness
can
wipe
out
lifetime
of
savings
our
costly
health
care
system
is
unsustainable
for
doctors
like
in
new
who
as
he
puts
it
spends
percent
of
each
day
supervising
staff
explaining
insurance
problems
to
patients
completing
forms
writing
appeal
letters
routine
that
he
calls
disruptive
and
distracting
giving
him
less
time
to
do
what
he
became
doctor
to
do
and
actually
care
for
his
patients
small
business
owners
like
and
link
in
are
also
struggling
they
always
wanted
to
do
right
by
the
workers
at
their
marketing
firm
but
they
recently
had
to
do
the
unthinkable
and
lay
off
number
of
employees
layoffs
that
could
have
been
deferred
they
say
if
health
care
costs
were
so
high
across
the
country
over
of
small
businesses
have
reduced
benefits
in
recent
years
and
have
dropped
their
workers
coverage
altogether
since
the
early
our
largest
companies
are
suffering
as
well
big
part
of
what
led
general
motors
and
into
trouble
in
recent
decades
were
the
huge
costs
they
racked
up
providing
health
care
for
their
workers
costs
that
made
them
less
profitable
and
less
competitive
with
around
the
world
if
we
do
not
fix
our
health
care
system
america
may
go
the
way
of
paying
more
getting
less
and
going
broke
when
it
comes
to
the
cost
of
our
health
care
then
the
status
is
unsustainable
so
reform
is
not
luxury
it
is
necessity
when
hear
people
say
well
why
are
you
taking
this
on
right
now
you
got
all
these
other
problems
keep
on
reminding
people
love
to
be
able
to
defer
these
issues
but
we
know
there
been
much
discussion
about
what
reform
would
cost
and
rightly
so
this
is
test
of
whether
we
democrats
and
republicans
alike
are
serious
about
holding
the
line
on
new
spending
and
restoring
fiscal
discipline
but
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
cost
of
inaction
is
greater
if
we
fail
to
act
if
we
fail
to
act
and
you
know
this
because
you
see
it
in
your
own
individual
practices
if
we
fail
to
act
premiums
will
climb
higher
benefits
will
erode
further
the
rolls
of
the
uninsured
will
swell
to
include
millions
more
americans
all
of
which
will
affect
your
practice
if
we
fail
to
act
one
out
of
every
five
dollars
we
earn
will
be
spent
on
health
care
within
decade
and
in
years
it
will
be
about
one
out
of
every
three
trend
that
will
mean
lost
jobs
lower
pay
shuttered
businesses
and
lower
standard
of
living
for
all
americans
and
if
we
fail
to
act
federal
spending
on
and
will
grow
over
the
coming
decades
by
an
amount
almost
equal
to
the
amount
our
government
currently
spends
on
our
nation
it
will
in
fact
eventually
grow
larger
than
what
our
government
spends
on
anything
else
today
it
scenario
that
will
swamp
our
federal
and
state
budgets
and
impose
vicious
choice
of
either
unprecedented
tax
hikes
or
overwhelming
deficits
or
drastic
cuts
in
our
federal
and
state
budgets
so
to
say
it
as
plainly
as
can
health
care
is
the
single
most
important
thing
we
can
do
for
america
fiscal
health
that
is
fact
that
fact
it
fact
and
the
truth
is
most
people
know
that
it
fact
and
yet
as
clear
as
it
is
that
our
system
badly
needs
reform
reform
is
not
inevitable
there
sense
out
there
among
some
and
perhaps
some
members
who
are
gathered
here
today
of
the
that
as
bad
as
our
current
system
may
be
and
it
pretty
bad
the
devil
we
know
is
better
than
the
devil
we
do
there
fear
of
change
worry
that
we
may
lose
what
works
about
our
health
care
system
while
trying
to
fix
what
does
here
to
tell
you
understand
that
fear
and
understand
the
cynicism
they
scars
left
over
from
past
efforts
at
reform
after
all
presidents
have
called
for
health
care
reform
for
nearly
century
teddy
called
for
it
harry
called
for
it
nixon
called
for
it
jimmy
carter
called
for
it
bill
called
for
it
but
while
significant
individual
reforms
have
been
made
such
as
and
the
children
health
insurance
program
efforts
at
comprehensive
reform
that
covers
everyone
and
brings
down
costs
have
largely
failed
part
of
the
reason
is
because
the
different
groups
involved
doctors
insurance
companies
businesses
workers
and
others
simply
could
agree
on
the
need
for
reform
or
what
shape
it
would
take
and
if
we
honest
another
part
of
the
reason
has
been
the
fierce
opposition
by
some
interest
groups
and
lobbyists
opposition
that
has
used
fear
tactics
to
paint
any
effort
to
achieve
reform
as
an
attempt
to
yes
medicine
and
despite
this
long
history
of
failure
standing
here
because
think
we
in
different
time
one
sign
that
things
are
different
is
that
just
this
past
week
the
senate
passed
bill
that
will
protect
children
from
the
dangers
of
smoking
reform
the
has
long
championed
this
long
championed
it
went
nowhere
when
it
was
proposed
decade
ago
going
to
sign
this
into
law
now
what
makes
this
moment
different
is
that
this
time
for
the
first
time
key
stakeholders
are
aligning
not
against
but
in
of
reform
they
coming
out
they
coming
together
out
of
recognition
that
while
reform
will
take
everyone
in
our
health
care
community
to
do
their
part
everybody
is
going
to
have
to
pitch
in
ultimately
everybody
will
benefit
and
want
to
commend
the
in
particular
for
offering
to
do
your
part
to
curb
costs
and
achieve
reform
just
week
ago
you
joined
together
with
hospitals
unions
insurers
medical
device
manufacturers
and
drug
companies
to
do
something
that
would
have
been
unthinkable
just
few
years
ago
you
promised
to
work
together
to
cut
national
health
care
spending
by
trillion
over
the
next
decade
relative
to
what
it
would
have
otherwise
been
and
that
will
bring
down
costs
that
will
bring
down
premiums
that
exactly
the
kind
of
cooperation
we
need
and
we
appreciate
that
very
much
thank
you
now
the
question
is
how
do
we
finish
the
job
how
do
we
permanently
bring
down
costs
and
make
quality
affordable
health
care
available
to
every
single
american
that
what
come
to
talk
about
today
we
know
the
moment
is
right
for
health
care
reform
we
know
this
is
historic
opportunity
we
never
seen
before
and
may
not
see
again
but
we
also
know
that
there
are
those
who
will
try
and
scuttle
this
opportunity
no
matter
what
who
will
use
the
same
scare
tactics
and
that
worked
in
the
past
who
will
give
warnings
about
medicine
and
government
takeovers
long
lines
and
rationed
care
decisions
made
by
bureaucrats
and
not
doctors
we
have
heard
this
all
before
and
because
these
fear
tactics
have
worked
things
have
kept
getting
worse
so
let
me
begin
by
saying
this
to
you
and
to
the
american
people
know
that
there
are
millions
of
americans
who
are
content
with
their
health
care
coverage
they
like
their
plan
and
most
importantly
they
value
their
relationship
with
their
doctor
they
trust
you
and
that
means
that
no
matter
how
we
reform
health
care
we
will
keep
this
promise
to
the
american
people
if
you
like
your
doctor
you
will
be
able
to
keep
your
doctor
period
if
you
like
your
health
care
plan
you
be
able
to
keep
your
health
care
plan
period
no
one
will
take
it
away
no
matter
what
my
view
is
that
health
care
reform
should
be
guided
by
simple
principle
fix
what
broken
and
build
on
what
works
and
that
what
we
intend
to
do
if
we
do
that
we
can
build
health
care
system
that
allows
you
to
be
physicians
instead
of
administrators
and
accountants
system
that
gives
americans
system
that
gives
americans
the
best
care
at
the
lowest
cost
system
that
eases
up
the
pressure
on
businesses
and
unleashes
the
promise
of
our
economy
creating
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
making
wages
thousands
of
dollars
higher
and
growing
our
economy
by
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
more
every
year
that
how
we
stop
spending
tax
dollars
to
prop
up
an
unsustainable
system
and
start
investing
those
dollars
in
innovations
and
advances
that
will
make
our
health
care
system
and
our
economy
stronger
that
what
we
can
do
with
this
opportunity
and
that
what
we
must
do
with
this
moment
now
the
good
news
is
that
in
some
instances
there
already
widespread
agreement
on
the
steps
necessary
to
make
our
health
care
system
work
better
first
we
need
to
upgrade
our
medical
records
by
switching
from
paper
to
an
electronic
system
of
record
keeping
and
we
already
begun
to
do
this
with
an
investment
we
made
as
part
of
our
recovery
act
it
simply
does
make
sense
that
patients
in
the
century
are
still
filling
out
forms
with
pens
on
papers
that
have
to
be
stored
away
somewhere
as
newt
has
rightly
pointed
out
and
do
quote
newt
that
often
we
do
better
job
tracking
package
in
this
country
than
we
do
tracking
patients
health
records
you
should
have
to
tell
every
new
doctor
you
see
about
your
medical
history
or
what
prescriptions
you
taking
you
should
have
to
repeat
costly
tests
all
that
information
should
be
stored
securely
in
private
medical
record
so
that
your
information
can
be
tracked
from
one
doctor
to
another
even
if
you
change
jobs
even
if
you
move
even
if
you
have
to
see
number
of
different
specialists
that
just
common
sense
and
that
will
not
only
mean
less
and
lower
administrative
costs
saving
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
it
will
also
mean
all
of
you
physicians
will
have
an
easier
time
doing
your
jobs
it
will
tell
you
the
doctors
what
drugs
patient
is
taking
so
you
can
avoid
prescribing
medication
that
could
cause
harmful
interaction
it
will
prevent
the
wrong
dosages
from
going
to
patient
it
will
reduce
medical
errors
it
estimated
that
lead
to
lives
lost
unnecessarily
in
our
hospitals
every
year
so
there
should
be
an
argument
there
and
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
helping
providers
so
that
we
can
get
this
system
up
and
running
the
second
step
that
we
can
all
agree
on
is
to
invest
more
in
preventive
care
so
we
can
avoid
illness
and
disease
in
the
first
place
that
starts
with
each
of
us
taking
more
responsibility
for
our
health
and
for
the
health
of
our
children
it
means
quitting
smoking
it
means
going
in
for
that
or
colon
cancer
screening
it
means
going
for
run
or
hitting
the
gym
and
raising
our
children
to
step
away
from
the
video
games
and
spend
more
time
playing
outside
it
also
means
cutting
down
on
all
the
junk
food
that
an
epidemic
of
obesity
which
puts
far
too
many
americans
young
and
old
at
greater
risk
of
costly
chronic
conditions
that
lesson
and
have
tried
to
in
our
daughters
as
some
of
you
know
we
started
white
house
vegetable
garden
say
we
generously
because
has
done
most
of
the
work
that
lesson
that
we
should
work
with
local
school
districts
to
incorporate
into
their
school
lunch
programs
building
health
care
system
that
promotes
prevention
rather
than
just
managing
diseases
will
require
all
of
us
to
do
our
parts
it
will
take
doctors
telling
us
what
risk
factors
we
should
avoid
and
what
preventive
measures
we
should
pursue
it
will
take
employers
following
the
example
of
places
like
that
is
rewarding
workers
for
taking
better
care
of
their
health
while
reducing
health
care
costs
in
the
process
if
you
one
of
of
workers
enrolled
in
their
healthy
measures
program
you
can
get
screened
for
problems
like
high
cholesterol
or
high
blood
pressure
and
if
you
score
well
you
can
pay
lower
premiums
you
get
more
money
in
your
it
program
that
has
helped
cut
health
care
spending
by
percent
and
workers
save
over
percent
on
their
premiums
and
we
open
to
doing
more
to
help
employers
adopt
and
expand
programs
like
this
one
our
federal
government
also
has
to
step
up
its
efforts
to
advance
the
cause
of
healthy
living
five
of
the
costliest
illnesses
and
conditions
cancer
cardiovascular
disease
diabetes
lung
disease
and
strokes
can
be
prevented
and
yet
only
fraction
of
every
health
care
dollar
goes
to
prevention
or
public
health
and
that
starting
to
change
with
an
investment
we
making
in
prevention
and
programs
that
can
help
us
avoid
disease
that
harm
our
health
and
the
health
of
our
economy
but
as
important
as
they
are
investments
in
electronic
records
and
preventive
care
all
the
things
that
just
mentioned
they
just
preliminary
steps
they
will
only
make
dent
in
the
epidemic
of
rising
costs
in
this
country
despite
what
some
have
suggested
the
reason
we
have
these
costs
is
not
simply
because
we
got
an
aging
population
demographics
do
account
for
part
of
rising
costs
because
older
sicker
societies
pay
more
on
health
care
than
younger
healthier
ones
and
there
nothing
intrinsically
wrong
in
us
taking
better
care
of
ourselves
but
what
accounts
for
the
bulk
of
our
costs
is
the
nature
of
our
health
care
delivery
system
itself
system
where
we
spend
vast
amounts
of
money
on
things
that
are
necessarily
making
our
people
any
healthier
system
that
automatically
equates
more
expensive
care
with
better
care
now
recent
article
in
the
new
yorker
for
example
showed
how
texas
is
spending
twice
as
much
as
county
twice
as
much
not
because
people
in
texas
are
sicker
than
they
are
in
not
because
they
getting
better
care
or
getting
better
outcomes
it
simply
because
they
using
more
treatments
treatments
that
in
some
cases
they
do
really
need
treatments
that
in
some
cases
can
actually
do
people
harm
by
raising
the
risk
of
infection
or
medical
error
and
the
problem
is
this
pattern
is
repeating
itself
across
america
one
study
shows
that
you
less
likely
you
no
less
likely
to
die
from
heart
attack
and
other
ailments
in
area
than
in
one
there
are
two
main
reasons
for
this
the
first
is
system
of
incentives
where
the
more
tests
and
services
are
provided
the
more
money
we
pay
and
lot
of
people
in
this
room
know
what
talking
about
it
model
that
rewards
the
quantity
of
care
rather
than
the
quality
of
care
that
pushes
you
the
doctor
to
see
more
and
more
patients
even
if
you
spend
much
time
with
each
and
gives
you
every
incentive
to
order
that
extra
or
even
if
it
not
necessary
it
model
that
has
taken
the
pursuit
of
medicine
from
profession
calling
to
business
that
not
why
you
became
doctors
that
not
why
you
put
in
all
those
hours
in
the
anatomy
suite
or
the
that
not
what
brings
you
back
to
patient
bedside
to
check
in
or
makes
you
call
loved
one
of
patient
to
say
it
will
be
fine
you
did
enter
this
profession
to
be
and
you
entered
this
profession
to
be
healers
and
that
what
our
health
care
system
should
let
you
be
that
what
this
health
care
system
should
let
you
be
now
that
starts
with
reforming
the
way
we
compensate
our
providers
doctors
and
hospitals
we
need
to
bundle
payments
so
you
are
paid
for
every
single
treatment
you
offer
patient
with
chronic
condition
like
diabetes
but
instead
paid
well
for
how
you
treat
the
overall
disease
we
need
to
create
incentives
for
physicians
to
team
up
because
we
know
that
when
that
happens
it
results
in
healthier
patient
we
need
to
give
doctors
bonuses
for
good
health
outcomes
so
we
not
promoting
just
more
treatment
but
better
care
and
we
need
to
rethink
the
cost
of
medical
education
and
do
more
to
reward
medical
students
who
choose
career
as
primary
care
physician
who
choose
to
work
in
areas
instead
of
the
more
lucrative
paths
that
why
we
making
substantial
investment
in
the
national
health
service
corps
that
will
make
medical
training
more
affordable
for
primary
care
doctors
and
nurse
practitioners
so
they
are
drowning
in
debt
when
they
enter
the
workforce
somebody
back
there
is
drowning
in
debt
the
second
structural
reform
we
need
to
make
is
to
improve
the
quality
of
medical
information
making
its
way
to
doctors
and
patients
we
have
the
best
medical
schools
the
most
sophisticated
labs
the
most
advanced
training
of
any
nation
on
the
globe
yet
we
not
doing
very
good
job
harnessing
our
collective
knowledge
and
experience
on
behalf
of
better
medicine
less
than
percent
of
our
health
care
spending
goes
to
examining
what
treatments
are
most
effective
less
than
percent
and
even
when
that
information
finds
its
way
into
journals
it
can
take
up
to
years
to
find
its
way
to
an
exam
room
or
operating
table
as
result
too
many
doctors
and
patients
are
making
decisions
without
the
benefit
of
the
latest
research
recent
study
for
example
found
that
only
half
of
all
cardiac
guidelines
are
based
on
scientific
evidence
half
that
means
doctors
may
be
doing
bypass
operation
when
placing
is
equally
effective
or
placing
when
adjusting
patient
drug
and
medical
management
is
equally
effective
all
of
which
drives
up
costs
without
improving
patient
health
so
one
thing
we
need
to
do
is
to
figure
out
what
works
and
encourage
rapid
implementation
of
what
works
into
your
practices
that
why
we
making
major
investment
in
research
to
identify
the
best
treatments
for
variety
of
ailments
and
conditions
now
let
me
be
clear
just
want
to
clear
something
up
here
identifying
what
works
is
not
about
dictating
what
kind
of
care
should
be
provided
it
about
providing
patients
and
doctors
with
the
information
they
need
to
make
the
best
medical
decisions
see
have
the
assumption
that
if
you
have
good
information
about
what
makes
your
patients
well
that
what
you
going
to
do
have
confidence
in
that
we
not
going
to
need
to
force
you
to
do
it
we
just
need
to
make
sure
you
got
the
best
information
available
still
even
when
we
do
know
what
works
we
are
often
not
making
the
most
of
it
and
that
why
we
need
to
build
on
the
examples
of
outstanding
medicine
at
places
like
the
children
hospital
where
the
quality
of
care
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
shot
up
after
the
hospital
began
incorporating
suggestions
from
parents
and
places
like
memorial
health
care
where
deaths
were
dramatically
reduced
with
rapid
response
teams
that
monitored
patients
conditions
and
rounds
with
everyone
from
physicians
to
pharmacists
and
places
like
health
system
in
rural
and
health
in
salt
lake
city
where
care
is
being
provided
at
cost
well
below
the
national
average
these
are
all
islands
of
excellence
that
we
need
to
make
the
standard
in
our
health
care
system
so
replicating
best
practices
excellence
closing
cost
disparities
any
legislation
sent
to
my
desk
that
does
not
these
does
not
achieve
these
goals
in
my
mind
does
not
earn
the
title
of
reform
but
my
signature
on
bill
is
not
enough
need
your
help
doctors
because
to
most
americans
you
are
the
health
care
system
the
fact
is
americans
and
include
myself
and
and
our
kids
in
this
we
just
do
what
you
tell
us
to
do
that
what
we
do
we
listen
to
you
we
trust
you
and
that
why
will
listen
to
you
and
work
with
you
to
pursue
reform
that
works
for
you
together
if
we
take
all
these
steps
am
convinced
we
can
bring
spending
down
bring
quality
up
we
can
save
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
on
health
care
costs
while
making
our
health
care
system
work
better
for
patients
and
doctors
alike
and
when
we
align
the
interests
of
patients
and
doctors
then
we
going
to
be
in
good
place
now
that
it
will
be
hard
to
make
some
of
these
changes
if
doctors
feel
like
they
constantly
looking
over
their
shoulders
for
fear
of
lawsuits
that
do
get
too
excited
yet
now
understand
some
doctors
may
feel
the
need
to
order
more
tests
and
treatments
to
avoid
being
legally
vulnerable
that
real
issue
now
just
hold
on
to
your
horses
here
guys
want
to
be
honest
with
you
not
advocating
caps
on
malpractice
awards
which
personally
believe
can
be
unfair
to
people
who
been
wrongfully
harmed
but
do
think
we
need
to
explore
range
of
ideas
about
how
to
put
patient
safety
first
how
to
let
doctors
focus
on
medicine
how
to
encourage
broader
use
of
guidelines
want
to
work
with
the
so
we
can
scale
back
the
excessive
defensive
medicine
that
reinforces
our
current
system
and
shift
to
system
where
we
are
providing
better
care
simply
rather
than
simply
more
treatment
so
this
is
going
to
be
priority
for
me
and
know
based
on
your
responses
it
priority
for
you
and
look
forward
to
working
with
you
and
it
going
to
be
difficult
but
all
this
stuff
is
going
to
be
difficult
all
of
it
going
to
be
important
now
know
this
has
been
long
but
we
got
more
to
do
the
changes
that
have
already
spoken
about
all
that
is
going
to
need
to
go
with
other
reforms
because
our
health
care
system
is
so
complex
and
medicine
is
always
evolving
we
need
way
to
continually
evaluate
how
we
can
eliminate
waste
reduce
costs
and
improve
quality
that
why
open
to
expanding
the
role
of
commission
created
by
republican
congress
called
the
payment
advisory
commission
which
happens
to
include
number
of
physicians
on
the
commission
in
recent
years
this
commission
proposed
roughly
billion
in
savings
that
never
made
it
into
law
these
recommendations
have
now
been
incorporated
into
our
broader
reform
agenda
but
we
need
to
their
proposals
the
commission
proposals
in
the
future
so
that
we
do
miss
another
opportunity
to
save
billions
of
dollars
as
we
gain
more
information
about
what
works
and
what
does
work
in
our
health
care
system
and
as
we
seek
to
contain
the
cost
of
health
care
we
also
have
to
ensure
that
every
american
can
get
coverage
they
can
afford
we
must
do
so
in
part
because
it
in
all
of
our
economic
interests
each
time
an
uninsured
american
steps
foot
into
an
emergency
room
with
no
way
to
reimburse
the
hospital
for
care
the
cost
is
handed
over
to
every
american
family
as
bill
of
about
that
reflected
in
higher
taxes
higher
premiums
and
higher
health
care
costs
it
hidden
tax
hidden
bill
that
will
be
cut
as
we
insure
all
americans
and
as
we
insure
every
young
and
healthy
american
it
will
spread
out
risk
for
insurance
companies
further
reducing
costs
for
everyone
but
alongside
these
economic
arguments
there
another
more
powerful
one
and
it
is
simply
this
we
are
not
nation
that
accepts
nearly
million
uninsured
men
women
and
children
we
are
not
nation
that
lets
hardworking
families
go
without
coverage
or
turns
its
back
on
those
in
need
we
nation
that
cares
for
its
citizens
we
look
out
for
one
another
that
what
makes
us
the
united
states
of
america
we
need
to
get
this
done
so
we
need
to
do
few
things
to
provide
affordable
health
insurance
to
every
single
american
the
first
thing
we
need
to
do
is
to
protect
what
working
in
our
health
care
system
so
just
in
case
you
did
catch
it
the
first
time
let
me
repeat
if
you
like
your
health
care
system
and
your
doctor
the
only
thing
reform
will
mean
to
you
is
your
health
care
will
cost
less
if
anyone
says
otherwise
they
are
either
trying
to
mislead
you
or
do
have
their
facts
straight
now
if
you
do
like
your
health
care
coverage
or
you
do
have
any
insurance
at
all
you
have
chance
under
what
we
proposed
to
take
part
in
what
we
calling
health
insurance
exchange
this
exchange
will
allow
you
to
shop
for
health
care
plan
compare
benefits
and
prices
and
choose
plan
that
best
for
you
and
your
family
the
same
way
by
the
way
that
federal
employees
can
do
from
postal
worker
to
member
of
congress
you
will
have
your
choice
of
number
of
plans
that
offer
few
different
packages
but
every
plan
would
offer
an
affordable
basic
package
again
this
is
for
people
who
are
happy
with
their
current
plan
if
you
like
what
you
getting
keep
it
nobody
is
forcing
you
to
shift
but
if
you
not
this
gives
you
some
new
options
and
believe
one
of
these
options
needs
to
be
public
option
that
will
give
people
broader
range
of
choices
and
inject
competition
into
the
health
care
market
so
that
force
so
that
we
can
force
waste
out
of
the
system
and
keep
the
insurance
companies
honest
now
know
that
there
some
concern
about
public
option
even
within
this
there
healthy
debate
about
it
in
particular
understand
that
you
concerned
that
today
rates
which
many
of
you
already
feel
are
too
low
will
be
applied
broadly
in
way
that
means
our
cost
savings
are
coming
off
your
backs
and
these
are
legitimate
concerns
but
they
ones
believe
that
can
be
overcome
as
stated
earlier
the
reforms
we
propose
to
reimbursement
are
to
reward
best
practices
focus
on
patient
care
not
on
the
current
piecework
what
we
seek
is
more
stability
and
health
care
system
that
on
sounder
financial
footing
and
the
fact
is
these
reforms
need
to
take
place
regardless
of
whether
there
public
option
or
not
with
reform
we
will
ensure
that
you
are
being
reimbursed
in
thoughtful
way
that
tied
to
patient
outcomes
instead
of
relying
on
yearly
negotiations
about
the
sustainable
growth
rate
formula
that
based
on
politics
and
the
immediate
state
of
the
federal
budget
in
any
given
year
and
just
want
to
point
out
the
alternative
to
such
reform
is
world
where
health
care
costs
grow
at
an
unsustainable
rate
and
if
you
do
think
that
going
to
threaten
your
and
the
stability
of
our
health
care
system
you
have
been
paying
attention
so
the
public
option
is
not
your
enemy
it
is
your
friend
believe
let
me
also
say
that
let
me
also
address
illegitimate
concern
that
being
put
forward
by
those
who
are
claiming
that
public
option
is
somehow
horse
for
system
be
honest
there
are
countries
where
system
works
pretty
well
but
believe
and
taken
some
flak
from
members
of
my
own
party
for
this
belief
that
it
important
for
our
reform
efforts
to
build
on
our
traditions
here
in
the
united
states
so
when
you
hear
the
claim
that
trying
to
bring
about
health
care
know
this
they
not
telling
the
truth
what
am
trying
to
do
and
what
public
option
will
help
do
is
put
affordable
health
care
within
reach
for
millions
of
americans
and
to
help
ensure
that
everyone
can
afford
the
cost
of
health
care
option
in
our
exchange
we
need
to
provide
assistance
to
families
who
need
it
that
way
there
will
be
no
reason
at
all
for
anyone
to
remain
uninsured
indeed
it
because
confident
in
our
ability
to
give
people
the
ability
to
get
insurance
at
an
affordable
rate
that
open
to
system
where
every
american
bears
responsibility
for
owning
health
insurance
so
long
as
we
provide
hardship
waiver
for
those
who
still
afford
it
as
we
move
towards
this
system
the
same
is
true
for
employers
while
believe
every
business
has
responsibility
to
provide
health
insurance
for
its
workers
small
businesses
that
afford
it
should
receive
an
exemption
and
small
business
workers
and
their
families
will
be
able
to
seek
coverage
in
the
exchange
if
their
employer
is
not
able
to
provide
it
now
here
some
good
news
insurance
companies
have
expressed
support
for
the
idea
of
covering
the
uninsured
and
they
certainly
are
in
of
mandate
welcome
their
willingness
to
engage
constructively
in
the
reform
debate
glad
they
at
the
table
but
what
refuse
to
do
is
simply
create
system
where
insurance
companies
suddenly
have
whole
bunch
of
more
customers
on
uncle
sam
dime
but
still
fail
to
meet
their
responsibilities
we
not
going
to
do
that
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
talking
about
we
need
to
end
the
practice
of
denying
coverage
on
the
basis
of
conditions
the
days
of
who
to
cover
and
who
to
deny
those
days
are
over
know
you
see
it
in
your
practices
and
how
incredibly
painful
and
frustrating
it
is
you
want
to
give
somebody
care
and
you
find
out
that
the
insurance
companies
are
wiggling
out
of
paying
this
is
personal
for
me
also
told
this
story
before
never
forget
watching
my
own
mother
as
she
fought
cancer
in
her
final
days
spending
time
worrying
about
whether
her
insurer
would
claim
her
illness
was
condition
so
it
could
get
out
of
providing
coverage
changing
the
current
approach
to
conditions
is
the
least
we
can
do
for
my
mother
and
for
every
other
mother
father
son
and
daughter
who
has
suffered
under
this
practice
who
been
paying
premiums
and
do
get
care
we
need
to
put
health
care
within
the
reach
for
millions
of
americans
now
even
if
we
accept
all
of
the
economic
and
moral
reasons
for
providing
affordable
coverage
to
all
americans
there
is
no
denying
that
expanding
coverage
will
come
at
cost
at
least
in
the
short
run
but
it
is
cost
that
will
not
repeat
will
not
add
to
our
deficits
set
down
rule
for
my
staff
for
my
team
and
said
this
to
congress
health
care
reform
must
be
and
will
be
in
the
next
decade
now
there
are
already
voices
saying
the
numbers
do
add
up
they
wrong
here
why
making
health
care
affordable
for
all
americans
will
cost
somewhere
on
the
order
of
trillion
over
the
next
years
that
real
money
even
in
washington
but
remember
that
less
than
we
are
projected
to
have
spent
on
the
war
in
iraq
and
also
remember
failing
to
reform
our
health
care
system
in
way
that
genuinely
reduces
cost
growth
will
cost
us
trillions
of
dollars
more
in
lost
economic
growth
and
lower
wages
that
said
let
me
explain
how
we
will
cover
the
price
tag
first
as
part
of
the
budget
that
was
passed
few
months
ago
we
put
aside
billion
over
years
in
what
we
calling
health
reserve
fund
over
half
of
that
amount
more
than
billion
will
come
from
raising
revenue
by
doing
things
like
modestly
limiting
the
tax
deductions
the
wealthiest
americans
can
take
to
the
same
level
that
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
years
same
level
that
it
was
under
some
are
concerned
that
this
will
dramatically
reduce
charitable
giving
for
example
but
statistics
show
that
not
true
and
the
best
thing
for
our
charities
is
the
stronger
economy
that
we
will
build
with
health
care
reform
but
we
just
raise
revenues
we
also
going
to
have
to
make
spending
cuts
in
part
by
examining
inefficiencies
in
our
current
program
there
are
going
to
be
robust
debates
about
where
these
cuts
should
be
made
and
welcome
that
debate
but
here
where
think
these
cuts
should
be
made
first
we
should
end
to
advantage
today
we
paying
advantage
plans
much
more
than
we
pay
for
traditional
services
now
this
is
good
deal
for
insurance
companies
it
subsidy
to
insurance
companies
it
not
good
deal
for
you
it
not
good
deal
for
the
american
people
and
by
the
way
it
does
follow
free
market
principles
for
those
who
are
always
talking
about
free
market
principles
that
why
we
need
to
introduce
competitive
bidding
into
the
advantage
program
program
under
which
private
insurance
companies
are
offering
coverage
that
alone
will
save
billion
over
the
next
decade
just
that
one
step
second
we
need
to
use
to
reduce
preventable
hospital
right
now
almost
percent
of
patients
discharged
from
hospitals
are
readmitted
within
month
often
because
they
not
getting
the
comprehensive
care
that
they
need
this
puts
people
at
risk
it
drives
up
cost
by
changing
how
reimburses
hospitals
we
can
discourage
them
from
acting
in
way
that
boosts
profits
but
drives
up
costs
for
everyone
else
that
will
save
us
billion
over
the
next
decade
third
we
need
to
introduce
generic
drugs
into
the
are
drugs
used
to
treat
illnesses
like
anemia
but
right
now
there
is
no
pathway
at
the
for
approving
generic
versions
of
these
drugs
creating
such
pathway
will
save
us
billions
of
dollars
we
can
save
another
roughly
billion
by
getting
better
deal
for
our
poorer
seniors
while
asking
our
seniors
to
pay
little
more
for
their
drugs
so
that
the
bulk
of
what
in
the
health
reserve
fund
also
proposed
saving
another
billion
in
and
spending
in
several
other
ways
one
way
is
by
adjusting
payments
to
reflect
new
advances
and
productivity
gains
in
our
economy
right
now
payments
are
rising
each
year
by
more
than
they
should
these
adjustments
will
create
incentives
for
providers
to
deliver
care
more
efficiently
and
save
us
roughly
billion
in
the
process
another
way
we
can
achieve
savings
is
by
reducing
payments
to
hospitals
for
treating
uninsured
people
know
hospitals
rely
on
these
payments
now
legitimately
because
of
the
large
number
of
uninsured
patients
that
they
treat
but
if
we
put
in
system
where
people
have
coverage
and
the
number
of
uninsured
people
goes
down
with
our
reforms
the
amount
we
pay
hospitals
to
treat
uninsured
people
should
go
down
as
well
reducing
these
payments
gradually
as
more
and
more
people
have
coverage
will
save
us
over
billion
and
we
make
sure
the
difference
goes
to
the
hospitals
that
need
it
most
we
can
also
save
about
billion
through
more
efficient
purchasing
of
prescription
drugs
and
we
can
save
about
billion
more
by
rooting
out
waste
abuse
fraud
throughout
our
health
care
system
so
that
no
one
is
charging
more
for
service
than
it
worth
or
charging
dime
for
service
that
they
do
provide
let
me
be
clear
committed
to
making
these
cuts
in
way
that
protects
our
senior
citizens
in
fact
these
proposals
will
actually
extend
the
life
of
the
trust
fund
by
seven
years
and
reduce
premiums
for
beneficiaries
by
roughly
billion
over
the
next
years
and
working
with
to
uphold
that
commitment
now
for
those
of
you
who
took
out
your
pencil
and
paper
altogether
these
savings
mean
that
we
put
about
billion
on
the
table
and
that
does
count
some
of
the
savings
that
we
think
will
come
about
from
reform
from
medical
it
for
example
or
increased
investment
in
prevention
so
that
stuff
in
congressional
jargon
is
not
the
congressional
budget
office
count
that
as
savings
so
we
setting
that
aside
we
think
that
going
to
come
but
even
separate
and
far
from
that
we
put
billion
on
the
table
taking
us
almost
all
the
way
to
covering
the
full
cost
of
health
care
reform
in
the
weeks
and
months
ahead
look
forward
to
working
with
congress
to
make
up
the
difference
so
that
health
care
reform
is
fully
paid
for
in
real
accountable
way
and
let
me
add
that
this
does
not
count
savings
just
want
to
repeat
that
by
insisting
that
the
reforms
that
we
introducing
are
over
the
next
decade
and
by
making
the
reforms
that
will
help
slow
the
growth
rate
of
health
care
costs
over
the
coming
decades
bending
the
curve
we
can
look
forward
to
faster
economic
growth
higher
living
standards
and
falling
instead
of
rising
budget
deficits
now
let
me
just
wrap
up
by
saying
this
know
people
are
cynical
whether
we
can
do
this
or
not
know
there
will
be
disagreements
about
how
to
proceed
in
the
days
ahead
there
probably
healthy
debate
within
the
that
good
also
know
this
we
let
this
moment
pass
us
by
you
know
the
other
day
friend
of
mine
congressman
earl
handed
me
magazine
with
special
issue
titled
the
crisis
in
american
medicine
one
article
notes
soaring
charges
another
warns
about
the
volume
of
of
services
another
asks
if
we
can
find
better
way
than
for
paying
for
medical
care
it
speaks
to
many
of
the
challenges
we
face
today
the
thing
is
this
special
issue
was
published
by
magazine
in
october
of
before
was
born
members
of
the
american
medical
association
and
my
fellow
americans
here
today
because
do
want
our
children
and
their
children
to
still
be
speaking
of
crisis
in
american
medicine
years
from
now
do
want
them
to
still
be
suffering
from
costs
that
we
did
not
stem
or
sicknesses
that
we
did
not
cure
do
want
them
to
be
burdened
with
massive
deficits
we
did
not
curb
or
worsening
economy
that
we
did
not
rebuild
want
them
to
benefit
from
health
care
system
that
works
for
all
of
us
where
families
can
open
doctor
bill
without
dreading
what
inside
where
parents
are
talking
to
their
kids
and
getting
them
to
get
regular
checkups
and
testing
themselves
for
preventable
ailments
where
parents
are
feeding
their
kids
healthier
food
and
kids
are
exercising
more
where
patients
are
spending
more
time
with
their
doctors
and
doctors
can
pull
up
on
computer
all
the
medical
information
and
latest
research
they
ever
want
to
know
to
meet
patients
needs
where
and
and
are
all
working
together
to
treat
single
human
being
where
what
best
about
america
health
care
system
has
become
the
hallmark
of
america
health
care
system
that
the
health
care
system
we
can
build
that
the
future
convinced
is
within
our
reach
and
if
we
willing
to
come
together
and
bring
about
that
future
then
we
will
not
only
make
americans
healthier
we
will
not
only
unleash
america
economic
potential
but
we
will
reaffirm
the
ideals
that
led
you
into
this
noble
profession
and
we
build
health
care
system
that
lets
all
americans
heal
thank
you
very
much
appreciate
it
thank
you
good
afternoon
thank
you
president
prime
minister
brown
prime
minister
and
prince
charles
for
being
here
today
thank
you
to
our
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
general
for
making
the
trip
out
here
to
join
us
thanks
also
to
whose
grandfather
began
this
mission
years
ago
with
simple
charge
ok
let
go
and
to
world
war
veteran
who
returned
home
from
this
war
to
serve
proud
and
distinguished
career
as
united
states
senator
and
national
leader
bob
dole
not
the
first
american
president
to
come
and
mark
this
anniversary
and
likely
will
not
be
the
last
this
is
an
event
that
has
long
brought
to
this
coast
both
heads
of
state
and
grateful
citizens
veterans
and
their
loved
ones
the
liberated
and
their
liberators
it
been
written
about
and
spoken
of
and
depicted
in
countless
books
and
films
and
speeches
and
long
after
our
time
on
this
earth
has
passed
one
word
will
still
bring
forth
the
pride
and
awe
of
men
and
women
who
will
never
meet
the
who
sit
before
us
why
is
this
of
all
the
battles
in
all
the
wars
across
the
span
of
human
history
why
does
this
day
hold
such
revered
place
in
our
memory
what
is
it
about
the
struggle
that
took
place
on
the
sands
few
short
steps
from
here
that
brings
us
back
to
remember
year
after
year
after
year
part
of
it
think
is
the
size
of
the
odds
that
weighed
against
success
for
three
centuries
no
invader
had
ever
been
able
to
cross
the
english
channel
into
normandy
and
it
had
never
been
more
difficult
than
in
that
was
the
year
that
hitler
ordered
his
top
field
marshal
to
fortify
the
atlantic
wall
against
seaborne
invasion
from
the
tip
of
norway
to
southern
france
the
nazis
lined
steep
cliffs
with
machine
guns
and
artillery
areas
were
flooded
to
block
passage
sharpened
poles
awaited
paratroopers
mines
were
laid
on
the
beaches
and
beneath
the
water
and
by
the
time
of
the
invasion
half
million
germans
waited
for
the
allies
along
the
coast
between
holland
and
northern
france
at
dawn
on
june
the
allies
came
the
best
chance
for
victory
had
been
for
the
british
royal
air
corps
to
take
out
the
guns
on
the
cliffs
while
airborne
divisions
parachuted
behind
enemy
lines
but
all
did
not
go
according
to
plan
paratroopers
landed
miles
from
their
mark
while
the
fog
and
clouds
prevented
allied
planes
from
destroying
the
guns
on
the
cliffs
so
when
the
ships
landed
here
at
an
unimaginable
hell
rained
down
on
the
men
inside
many
never
made
it
out
of
the
boats
and
yet
despite
all
of
this
one
by
one
the
allied
forces
made
their
way
to
shore
here
and
at
utah
and
juno
gold
and
sword
they
were
american
british
and
canadian
soon
the
paratroopers
found
each
other
and
fought
their
way
back
the
rangers
scaled
the
cliffs
and
by
the
end
of
the
day
against
all
odds
the
ground
on
which
we
stand
was
free
once
more
the
sheer
improbability
of
this
victory
is
part
of
what
makes
so
memorable
it
also
arises
from
the
clarity
of
purpose
with
which
this
war
was
waged
we
live
in
world
of
competing
beliefs
and
claims
about
what
is
true
it
world
of
varied
religions
and
cultures
and
forms
of
government
in
such
world
it
all
too
rare
for
struggle
to
emerge
that
speaks
to
something
universal
about
humanity
the
second
world
war
did
that
no
man
who
shed
blood
or
lost
brother
would
say
that
war
is
good
but
all
know
that
this
war
was
essential
for
what
we
faced
in
nazi
totalitarianism
was
not
just
battle
of
competing
interests
it
was
competing
vision
of
humanity
nazi
ideology
sought
to
subjugate
and
humiliate
and
exterminate
it
perpetrated
murder
on
massive
scale
by
hatred
of
those
who
were
deemed
different
and
therefore
inferior
it
was
evil
the
nations
that
joined
together
to
defeat
hitler
reich
were
not
perfect
they
had
made
their
share
of
mistakes
had
not
always
agreed
with
one
another
on
every
issue
but
whatever
god
we
prayed
to
whatever
our
differences
we
knew
that
the
evil
we
faced
had
to
be
stopped
citizens
of
all
faiths
and
of
no
faith
came
to
believe
that
we
could
not
remain
as
bystanders
to
the
savage
perpetration
of
death
and
destruction
and
so
we
joined
and
sent
our
sons
to
fight
and
often
die
so
that
men
and
women
they
never
met
might
know
what
it
is
to
be
free
in
america
it
was
an
that
inspired
nation
to
action
president
who
asked
his
country
to
pray
on
also
asked
its
citizens
to
serve
and
sacrifice
to
make
the
invasion
possible
on
farms
and
in
factories
millions
of
men
and
women
worked
three
shifts
day
month
after
month
year
after
year
trucks
and
tanks
came
from
plants
in
michigan
and
indiana
new
york
and
illinois
bombers
and
fighter
planes
rolled
off
assembly
lines
in
ohio
and
where
my
grandmother
did
her
part
as
an
inspector
shipyards
on
both
coasts
produced
the
largest
fleet
in
history
including
the
landing
craft
from
new
that
eventually
made
it
here
to
but
despite
all
the
years
of
planning
and
preparation
despite
the
inspiration
of
our
leaders
the
skill
of
our
generals
the
strength
of
our
firepower
and
the
unyielding
support
from
our
home
front
the
outcome
of
the
entire
struggle
would
ultimately
rest
on
the
success
of
one
day
in
june
once
said
that
there
are
certain
moments
when
and
fate
meet
at
single
time
in
single
place
to
shape
turning
point
in
man
unending
search
for
freedom
was
such
moment
one
newspaper
noted
that
we
have
come
to
the
hour
for
which
we
were
born
had
the
allies
failed
here
hitler
occupation
of
this
continent
might
have
continued
indefinitely
instead
victory
here
secured
foothold
in
france
it
opened
path
to
berlin
it
made
possible
the
achievements
that
followed
the
liberation
of
europe
the
plan
the
nato
alliance
the
shared
prosperity
and
security
that
flowed
from
each
it
was
unknowable
then
but
so
much
of
the
progress
that
would
define
the
century
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
came
down
to
the
battle
for
slice
of
beach
only
six
miles
long
and
two
miles
wide
more
particularly
it
came
down
to
the
men
who
landed
here
those
who
now
rest
in
this
place
for
eternity
and
those
who
are
with
us
here
today
perhaps
more
than
any
other
reason
you
the
veterans
of
that
landing
are
why
we
still
remember
what
happened
on
you
why
we
keep
coming
back
for
you
remind
us
that
in
the
end
human
destiny
is
not
determined
by
forces
beyond
our
control
you
remind
us
that
our
future
is
not
shaped
by
mere
chance
or
circumstance
our
history
has
always
been
the
sum
total
of
the
choices
made
and
the
actions
taken
by
each
individual
man
and
woman
it
has
always
been
up
to
us
you
could
have
done
what
hitler
believed
you
would
do
when
you
arrived
here
in
the
face
of
merciless
assault
from
these
cliffs
you
could
have
idled
the
boats
offshore
amid
barrage
of
tracer
bullets
that
lit
the
night
sky
you
could
have
stayed
in
those
planes
you
could
have
hid
in
the
hedgerows
or
waited
behind
the
you
could
have
done
only
what
was
necessary
to
ensure
your
own
survival
but
that
not
what
you
did
that
not
the
story
you
told
on
your
story
was
written
by
men
like
of
the
airborne
who
parachuted
into
dark
marsh
far
from
his
objective
and
his
men
lost
and
alone
he
still
managed
to
fight
his
way
through
the
gunfire
and
help
liberate
the
town
in
which
he
landed
town
where
street
now
bears
his
name
it
story
written
by
men
like
an
army
ranger
who
saw
half
the
men
on
his
landing
craft
drown
when
it
was
hit
by
shellfire
just
thousand
yards
off
this
beach
he
spent
three
hours
in
freezing
water
and
was
one
of
only
rangers
to
survive
out
of
the
who
were
sent
to
scale
the
cliffs
and
it
story
written
by
so
many
who
are
no
longer
with
us
like
private
was
only
supposed
to
serve
as
guide
for
the
infantry
division
but
he
instead
became
one
of
its
after
wading
ashore
in
water
he
returned
to
the
water
again
and
again
and
again
to
save
his
wounded
and
drowning
comrades
and
under
the
heaviest
possible
enemy
fire
he
carried
them
to
safety
he
carried
them
in
his
own
arms
this
is
the
story
of
the
allied
victory
it
the
legend
of
units
like
easy
company
and
the
it
the
tale
of
the
british
people
whose
courage
during
the
blitz
forced
hitler
to
call
off
the
invasion
of
england
the
who
came
even
though
they
were
never
attacked
the
who
sustained
some
of
the
war
heaviest
casualties
on
the
eastern
front
and
all
those
french
men
and
women
who
would
rather
have
died
resisting
tyranny
than
lived
within
its
grasp
it
is
the
memories
that
have
been
passed
on
to
so
many
of
us
about
the
service
or
sacrifice
of
friend
or
relative
for
me
it
is
my
grandfather
who
arrived
on
this
beach
six
weeks
after
and
marched
across
europe
in
army
and
it
is
my
great
uncle
who
was
part
of
the
first
american
division
to
reach
and
liberate
nazi
concentration
camp
his
name
is
charles
and
so
proud
that
he
with
us
here
today
know
this
trip
does
get
any
easier
as
the
years
pass
but
for
those
of
you
who
make
it
there
nothing
that
could
keep
you
away
one
such
veteran
man
named
was
member
of
the
parachute
infantry
division
of
the
airborne
last
night
after
visiting
this
cemetery
for
one
last
time
he
passed
away
in
his
sleep
was
gravely
ill
when
he
left
his
home
and
he
knew
that
he
might
not
return
but
just
as
he
did
years
ago
he
came
anyway
may
he
now
rest
in
peace
with
the
boys
he
once
bled
with
and
may
his
family
always
find
solace
in
the
heroism
he
showed
here
in
the
end
came
back
to
normandy
for
the
same
reason
we
all
come
back
he
came
for
the
reason
articulated
by
another
former
paratrooper
who
is
here
with
us
today
when
asked
why
he
made
the
trip
said
it
important
that
we
tell
our
stories
it
does
have
to
be
something
little
story
about
what
happened
so
people
do
forget
so
people
do
forget
friends
and
veterans
we
can
not
forget
what
we
must
not
forget
is
that
was
time
and
place
where
the
bravery
and
the
of
few
was
able
to
change
the
course
of
an
entire
century
at
an
hour
of
maximum
danger
amid
the
bleakest
of
circumstances
men
who
thought
themselves
ordinary
found
within
themselves
the
ability
to
do
something
extraordinary
they
fought
for
their
moms
and
sweethearts
back
home
for
the
fellow
warriors
they
came
to
know
as
brothers
and
they
fought
out
of
simple
sense
of
duty
duty
sustained
by
the
same
ideals
for
which
their
countrymen
had
once
fought
and
bled
for
over
two
centuries
that
is
the
story
of
normandy
but
also
the
story
of
america
of
the
who
gathered
on
green
in
of
the
union
boys
from
maine
who
repelled
charge
at
of
the
men
who
gave
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
at
and
san
of
all
the
young
men
and
women
whose
and
goodness
still
carry
forward
this
legacy
of
service
and
sacrifice
it
story
that
has
never
come
easy
but
one
that
always
gives
us
hope
for
as
we
face
down
the
hardships
and
struggles
of
our
time
and
arrive
at
that
hour
for
which
we
were
born
we
can
not
help
but
draw
strength
from
those
moments
in
history
when
the
best
among
us
were
somehow
able
to
swallow
their
fears
and
secure
beachhead
on
an
unforgiving
shore
to
those
men
who
achieved
that
victory
years
ago
we
thank
you
for
your
service
may
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
all
those
who
rest
here
chancellor
and
have
just
finished
our
tour
here
at
want
to
thank
who
gave
an
outstanding
account
of
what
we
were
witnessing
am
particularly
grateful
to
be
accompanied
by
my
friend
as
well
as
both
of
whom
are
survivors
of
this
place
we
saw
the
area
known
as
little
camp
where
and
were
sent
as
boys
in
fact
at
the
place
that
commemorates
this
camp
there
is
photograph
in
which
we
can
see
in
one
of
the
bunks
along
with
the
others
we
saw
the
ovens
of
the
crematorium
the
guard
towers
the
barbed
wire
fences
the
foundations
of
barracks
that
once
held
people
in
the
most
unimaginable
conditions
we
saw
the
memorial
to
all
the
survivors
steel
plate
as
chancellor
said
that
is
heated
to
degrees
celsius
the
temperature
of
the
human
body
reminder
where
people
were
deemed
inhuman
because
of
their
differences
of
the
mark
that
we
all
share
now
these
sights
have
not
lost
their
horror
with
the
passage
of
time
as
we
were
walking
up
said
if
these
trees
could
talk
and
there
certain
irony
about
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
and
the
horror
that
took
place
here
more
than
half
century
later
our
grief
and
our
outrage
over
what
happened
have
not
diminished
will
not
forget
what
seen
here
today
known
about
this
place
since
was
boy
hearing
stories
about
my
great
uncle
who
was
very
young
man
serving
in
world
war
he
was
part
of
the
infantry
division
the
first
americans
to
reach
concentration
camp
they
liberated
one
of
and
told
this
story
he
returned
from
his
service
in
state
of
shock
saying
little
and
isolating
himself
for
months
on
end
from
family
and
friends
alone
with
the
painful
memories
that
would
not
leave
his
head
and
as
we
see
as
we
saw
some
of
the
images
here
it
understandable
that
someone
who
witnessed
what
had
taken
place
here
would
be
in
state
of
shock
my
great
uncle
commander
general
understood
this
impulse
to
silence
he
had
seen
the
piles
of
bodies
and
starving
survivors
and
deplorable
conditions
that
the
american
soldiers
found
when
they
arrived
and
he
knew
that
those
who
witnessed
these
things
might
be
too
stunned
to
speak
about
them
or
be
able
be
unable
to
find
the
words
to
describe
them
that
they
might
be
rendered
mute
in
the
way
my
great
uncle
had
and
he
knew
that
what
had
happened
here
was
so
unthinkable
that
after
the
bodies
had
been
taken
away
that
perhaps
no
one
would
believe
it
and
that
why
he
ordered
american
troops
and
germans
from
the
nearby
town
to
tour
the
camp
he
invited
congressmen
and
journalists
to
bear
witness
and
ordered
photographs
and
films
to
be
made
and
he
insisted
on
viewing
every
corner
of
these
camps
so
that
and
quote
he
could
be
in
position
to
give
evidence
of
these
things
if
ever
in
the
future
there
develops
tendency
to
charge
these
allegations
merely
to
propaganda
we
are
here
today
because
we
know
this
work
is
not
yet
finished
to
this
day
there
are
those
who
insist
that
the
holocaust
never
happened
denial
of
fact
and
truth
that
is
baseless
and
ignorant
and
hateful
this
place
is
the
ultimate
rebuke
to
such
thoughts
reminder
of
our
duty
to
confront
those
who
would
tell
lies
about
our
history
also
to
this
day
there
are
those
who
perpetuate
every
form
of
intolerance
racism
homophobia
xenophobia
sexism
and
more
hatred
that
degrades
its
victims
and
diminishes
us
all
in
this
century
we
seen
genocide
we
seen
mass
graves
and
the
ashes
of
villages
burned
to
the
ground
children
used
as
soldiers
and
rape
used
as
weapon
of
war
this
places
teaches
us
that
we
must
be
ever
vigilant
about
the
spread
of
evil
in
our
own
time
that
we
must
reject
the
false
comfort
that
others
suffering
is
not
our
problem
and
commit
ourselves
to
resisting
those
who
would
subjugate
others
to
serve
their
own
interests
but
as
we
reflect
today
on
the
human
capacity
for
evil
and
our
shared
obligation
to
defy
it
we
also
reminded
of
the
human
capacity
for
good
for
amidst
the
countless
acts
of
cruelty
that
took
place
here
we
know
that
there
were
many
acts
of
courage
and
kindness
as
well
the
jews
who
insisted
on
fasting
on
the
camp
cook
who
hid
in
the
lining
of
his
prison
uniform
and
distributed
them
to
his
fellow
inmates
risking
his
own
life
to
help
save
theirs
the
prisoners
who
special
effort
to
protect
the
children
here
sheltering
them
from
work
and
giving
them
extra
food
they
set
up
secret
classrooms
some
of
the
inmates
and
taught
history
and
math
and
urged
the
children
to
think
about
their
future
professions
and
we
were
just
hearing
about
the
resistance
that
formed
and
the
irony
that
the
base
for
the
resistance
was
in
the
latrine
areas
because
the
guards
found
it
so
offensive
that
they
would
go
there
and
so
out
of
the
filth
that
became
space
in
which
small
freedoms
could
thrive
when
the
american
arrived
they
were
astonished
to
find
more
than
children
still
alive
and
the
youngest
was
just
three
years
old
and
told
that
couple
of
the
prisoners
even
wrote
song
that
many
here
sang
among
the
lyrics
were
these
whatever
our
fate
we
will
say
yes
to
life
for
the
day
will
come
when
we
are
free
in
our
blood
we
carry
the
will
to
live
and
in
our
hearts
in
our
hearts
faith
these
individuals
never
could
have
known
the
world
would
one
day
speak
of
this
place
they
could
not
have
known
that
some
of
them
would
live
to
have
children
and
grandchildren
who
would
grow
up
hearing
their
stories
and
would
return
here
so
many
years
later
to
find
museum
and
memorials
and
the
clock
tower
set
permanently
to
the
moment
of
liberation
they
could
not
have
known
how
the
nation
of
israel
would
rise
out
of
the
destruction
of
the
holocaust
and
the
strong
enduring
bonds
between
that
great
nation
and
my
own
and
they
could
not
have
known
that
one
day
an
american
president
would
visit
this
place
and
speak
of
them
and
that
he
would
do
so
standing
side
by
side
with
the
german
chancellor
in
germany
that
is
now
vibrant
democracy
and
valued
american
ally
they
could
not
have
known
these
things
but
still
surrounded
by
death
they
willed
themselves
to
hold
fast
to
life
in
their
hearts
they
still
had
faith
that
evil
would
not
triumph
in
the
end
that
while
history
is
unknowable
it
arches
towards
progress
and
that
the
world
would
one
day
remember
them
and
it
is
now
up
to
us
the
living
in
our
work
wherever
we
are
to
resist
injustice
and
intolerance
and
indifference
in
whatever
forms
they
may
take
and
ensure
that
those
who
were
lost
here
did
not
go
in
vain
it
is
up
to
us
to
redeem
that
faith
it
is
up
to
us
to
bear
witness
to
ensure
that
the
world
continues
to
note
what
happened
here
to
remember
all
those
who
survived
and
all
those
who
perished
and
to
remember
them
not
just
as
victims
but
also
as
individuals
who
hoped
and
loved
and
dreamed
just
like
us
and
just
as
we
identify
with
the
victims
it
also
important
for
us
think
to
remember
that
the
perpetrators
of
such
evil
were
human
as
well
and
that
we
have
to
guard
against
cruelty
in
ourselves
and
want
to
express
particular
thanks
to
chancellor
and
the
german
people
because
it
not
easy
to
look
into
the
past
in
this
way
and
acknowledge
it
and
make
something
of
it
make
determination
that
they
will
stand
guard
against
acts
like
this
happening
again
rather
than
have
me
end
with
my
remarks
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
have
provide
some
reflection
and
some
thought
as
he
returns
here
so
many
years
later
to
the
place
where
his
father
died
thank
you
so
much
good
afternoon
am
to
be
in
the
timeless
city
of
cairo
and
to
be
hosted
by
two
remarkable
institutions
for
over
thousand
years
has
stood
as
beacon
of
islamic
learning
and
for
over
century
cairo
university
has
been
source
of
egypt
advancement
and
together
you
represent
the
harmony
between
tradition
and
progress
grateful
for
your
hospitality
and
the
hospitality
of
the
people
of
egypt
and
also
proud
to
carry
with
me
the
goodwill
of
the
american
people
and
greeting
of
peace
from
muslim
communities
in
my
country
peace
be
upon
you
we
meet
at
time
of
great
tension
between
the
united
states
and
muslims
around
the
world
tension
rooted
in
historical
forces
that
go
beyond
any
current
policy
debate
the
relationship
between
islam
and
the
west
includes
centuries
of
coexistence
and
cooperation
but
also
conflict
and
religious
wars
more
recently
tension
has
been
fed
by
colonialism
that
denied
rights
and
opportunities
to
many
muslims
and
cold
war
in
which
countries
were
too
often
treated
as
proxies
without
regard
to
their
own
aspirations
moreover
the
sweeping
change
brought
by
modernity
and
led
many
muslims
to
view
the
west
as
hostile
to
the
traditions
of
islam
violent
extremists
have
exploited
these
tensions
in
small
but
potent
minority
of
muslims
the
attacks
of
september
and
the
continued
efforts
of
these
extremists
to
engage
in
violence
against
civilians
has
led
some
in
my
country
to
view
islam
as
inevitably
hostile
not
only
to
america
and
western
countries
but
also
to
human
rights
all
this
has
bred
more
fear
and
more
mistrust
so
long
as
our
relationship
is
defined
by
our
differences
we
will
empower
those
who
sow
hatred
rather
than
peace
those
who
promote
conflict
rather
than
the
cooperation
that
can
help
all
of
our
people
achieve
justice
and
prosperity
and
this
cycle
of
suspicion
and
discord
must
end
come
here
to
cairo
to
seek
new
beginning
between
the
united
states
and
muslims
around
the
world
one
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
one
based
upon
the
truth
that
america
and
islam
are
not
exclusive
and
need
not
be
in
competition
instead
they
overlap
and
share
common
principles
principles
of
justice
and
progress
tolerance
and
the
dignity
of
all
human
beings
do
so
that
change
can
not
happen
overnight
know
there
been
lot
of
publicity
about
this
but
no
single
can
eradicate
years
of
mistrust
nor
can
answer
in
the
time
that
have
this
afternoon
all
the
complex
questions
that
brought
us
to
this
point
but
am
convinced
that
in
order
to
move
forward
we
must
say
openly
to
each
other
the
things
we
hold
in
our
hearts
and
that
too
often
are
said
only
behind
closed
doors
there
must
be
sustained
effort
to
listen
to
each
other
to
learn
from
each
other
to
respect
one
another
and
to
seek
common
ground
as
the
holy
tells
us
be
conscious
of
god
and
speak
always
the
truth
that
is
what
will
try
to
do
today
to
speak
the
truth
as
best
can
humbled
by
the
task
before
us
and
firm
in
my
belief
that
the
interests
we
share
as
human
beings
are
far
more
powerful
than
the
forces
that
drive
us
apart
now
part
of
this
conviction
is
rooted
in
my
own
experience
christian
but
my
father
came
from
kenyan
family
that
includes
generations
of
muslims
as
boy
spent
several
years
in
and
heard
the
call
of
the
at
the
break
of
dawn
and
at
the
fall
of
dusk
as
young
man
worked
in
chicago
communities
where
many
found
dignity
and
peace
in
their
muslim
faith
as
student
of
history
also
know
debt
to
islam
it
was
islam
at
places
like
that
carried
the
light
of
learning
through
so
many
centuries
paving
the
way
for
europe
renaissance
and
enlightenment
it
was
innovation
in
muslim
communities
it
was
innovation
in
muslim
communities
that
developed
the
order
of
algebra
our
magnetic
compass
and
tools
of
navigation
our
mastery
of
pens
and
printing
our
understanding
of
how
disease
spreads
and
how
it
can
be
healed
islamic
culture
has
given
us
majestic
arches
and
soaring
spires
timeless
poetry
and
cherished
music
elegant
calligraphy
and
places
of
peaceful
contemplation
and
throughout
history
islam
has
demonstrated
through
words
and
deeds
the
possibilities
of
religious
tolerance
and
racial
equality
also
know
that
islam
has
always
been
part
of
america
story
the
first
nation
to
my
country
was
morocco
in
signing
the
treaty
of
tripoli
in
our
second
president
john
wrote
the
united
states
has
in
itself
no
character
of
enmity
against
the
laws
religion
or
of
muslims
and
since
our
founding
american
muslims
have
enriched
the
united
states
they
have
fought
in
our
wars
they
have
served
in
our
government
they
have
stood
for
civil
rights
they
have
started
businesses
they
have
taught
at
our
universities
they
excelled
in
our
sports
arenas
they
won
prizes
built
our
tallest
building
and
lit
the
olympic
torch
and
when
the
first
muslim
american
was
recently
elected
to
congress
he
took
the
oath
to
defend
our
constitution
using
the
same
holy
that
one
of
our
founding
fathers
thomas
kept
in
his
personal
library
so
have
known
islam
on
three
continents
before
coming
to
the
region
where
it
was
first
revealed
that
experience
guides
my
conviction
that
partnership
between
america
and
islam
must
be
based
on
what
islam
is
not
what
it
is
and
consider
it
part
of
my
responsibility
as
president
of
the
united
states
to
fight
against
negative
stereotypes
of
islam
wherever
they
appear
but
that
same
principle
must
apply
to
muslim
perceptions
of
america
just
as
muslims
just
as
muslims
do
not
fit
crude
stereotype
america
is
not
the
crude
stereotype
of
empire
the
united
states
has
been
one
of
the
greatest
sources
of
progress
that
the
world
has
ever
known
we
were
born
out
of
revolution
against
an
empire
we
were
founded
upon
the
ideal
that
all
are
created
equal
and
we
have
shed
blood
and
struggled
for
centuries
to
give
meaning
to
those
words
within
our
borders
and
around
the
world
we
are
shaped
by
every
culture
drawn
from
every
end
of
the
earth
and
dedicated
to
simple
concept
out
of
many
one
now
much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
an
african
american
with
the
name
could
be
elected
president
but
my
personal
story
is
not
so
unique
the
dream
of
opportunity
for
all
people
has
not
come
true
for
everyone
in
america
but
its
promise
exists
for
all
who
come
to
our
shores
and
that
includes
nearly
million
american
muslims
in
our
country
today
who
by
the
way
enjoy
incomes
and
educational
levels
that
are
higher
than
the
american
average
moreover
freedom
in
america
is
indivisible
from
the
freedom
to
practice
one
religion
that
is
why
there
is
mosque
in
every
state
in
our
union
and
over
mosques
within
our
borders
that
why
the
united
states
government
has
gone
to
court
to
protect
the
right
of
women
and
girls
to
wear
the
and
to
punish
those
who
would
deny
it
so
let
there
be
no
doubt
let
there
be
no
doubt
islam
is
part
of
america
and
believe
that
america
holds
within
her
the
truth
that
regardless
of
race
religion
or
station
in
life
all
of
us
share
common
aspirations
to
live
in
peace
and
security
to
get
an
education
and
to
work
with
dignity
to
love
our
families
our
communities
and
our
god
these
things
we
share
this
is
the
hope
of
all
humanity
of
course
our
common
humanity
is
only
the
beginning
of
our
task
words
alone
can
not
meet
the
needs
of
our
people
these
needs
will
be
met
only
if
we
act
boldly
in
the
years
ahead
and
if
we
understand
that
the
challenges
we
face
are
shared
and
our
failure
to
meet
them
will
hurt
us
all
for
we
have
learned
from
recent
experience
that
when
financial
system
weakens
in
one
country
prosperity
is
hurt
everywhere
when
new
infects
one
human
being
all
are
at
risk
when
one
nation
pursues
nuclear
weapon
the
risk
of
nuclear
attack
rises
for
all
nations
when
violent
extremists
operate
in
one
stretch
of
mountains
people
are
endangered
across
an
ocean
when
innocents
in
bosnia
and
are
slaughtered
that
is
stain
on
our
collective
conscience
that
is
what
it
means
to
share
this
world
in
the
century
that
is
the
responsibility
we
have
to
one
another
as
human
beings
and
this
is
difficult
responsibility
to
embrace
for
human
history
has
often
been
record
of
nations
and
tribes
and
yes
religions
subjugating
one
another
in
pursuit
of
their
own
interests
yet
in
this
new
age
such
attitudes
are
given
our
interdependence
any
world
order
that
elevates
one
nation
or
group
of
people
over
another
will
inevitably
fail
so
whatever
we
think
of
the
past
we
must
not
be
prisoners
to
it
our
problems
must
be
dealt
with
through
partnership
our
progress
must
be
shared
now
that
does
not
mean
we
should
ignore
sources
of
tension
indeed
it
suggests
the
opposite
we
must
face
these
tensions
squarely
and
so
in
that
spirit
let
me
speak
as
clearly
and
as
plainly
as
can
about
some
specific
issues
that
believe
we
must
finally
confront
together
the
first
issue
that
we
have
to
confront
is
violent
extremism
in
all
of
its
forms
in
ankara
made
clear
that
america
is
not
and
never
will
be
at
war
with
islam
we
will
however
relentlessly
confront
violent
extremists
who
pose
grave
threat
to
our
security
because
we
reject
the
same
thing
that
people
of
all
faiths
reject
the
killing
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
and
it
is
my
first
duty
as
president
to
protect
the
american
people
the
situation
in
demonstrates
america
goals
and
our
need
to
work
together
over
seven
years
ago
the
united
states
pursued
and
the
with
broad
international
support
we
did
not
go
by
choice
we
went
because
of
necessity
aware
that
there
still
some
who
would
question
or
even
justify
the
events
of
but
let
us
be
clear
killed
nearly
people
on
that
day
the
victims
were
innocent
men
women
and
children
from
america
and
many
other
nations
who
had
done
nothing
to
harm
anybody
and
yet
chose
to
ruthlessly
murder
these
people
claimed
credit
for
the
attack
and
even
now
states
their
determination
to
kill
on
massive
scale
they
have
affiliates
in
many
countries
and
are
trying
to
expand
their
reach
these
are
not
opinions
to
be
debated
these
are
facts
to
be
dealt
with
now
make
no
mistake
we
do
not
want
to
keep
our
troops
in
we
see
no
military
we
seek
no
military
bases
there
it
is
for
america
to
lose
our
young
men
and
women
it
is
costly
and
politically
difficult
to
continue
this
conflict
we
would
gladly
bring
every
single
one
of
our
troops
home
if
we
could
be
confident
that
there
were
not
violent
extremists
in
and
now
pakistan
determined
to
kill
as
many
americans
as
they
possibly
can
but
that
is
not
yet
the
case
and
that
why
we
partnering
with
coalition
of
countries
and
despite
the
costs
involved
america
commitment
will
not
weaken
indeed
none
of
us
should
tolerate
these
extremists
they
have
killed
in
many
countries
they
have
killed
people
of
different
faiths
but
more
than
any
other
they
have
killed
muslims
their
actions
are
irreconcilable
with
the
rights
of
human
beings
the
progress
of
nations
and
with
islam
the
teaches
that
whoever
kills
an
innocent
is
as
it
is
as
if
he
has
killed
all
mankind
and
the
holy
also
says
whoever
whoever
saves
person
it
is
as
if
he
has
saved
all
mankind
the
enduring
faith
of
over
billion
people
is
so
much
bigger
than
the
narrow
hatred
of
few
islam
is
not
part
of
the
problem
in
combating
violent
extremism
it
is
an
important
part
of
promoting
peace
now
we
also
know
that
military
power
alone
is
not
going
to
solve
the
problems
in
and
pakistan
that
why
we
plan
to
invest
billion
dollars
each
year
over
the
next
five
years
to
partner
with
to
build
schools
and
hospitals
roads
and
businesses
and
hundreds
of
millions
to
help
those
who
been
displaced
that
why
we
are
providing
more
than
billion
dollars
to
help
afghans
develop
their
economy
and
deliver
services
that
people
depend
on
let
me
also
address
the
issue
of
iraq
unlike
iraq
was
war
of
choice
that
provoked
strong
differences
in
my
country
and
around
the
world
although
believe
that
the
iraqi
people
are
ultimately
better
off
without
the
tyranny
of
also
believe
that
events
in
iraq
have
reminded
america
of
the
need
to
use
diplomacy
and
build
international
consensus
to
resolve
our
problems
whenever
possible
indeed
we
can
recall
the
words
of
thomas
who
said
hope
that
our
wisdom
will
grow
with
our
power
and
teach
us
that
the
less
we
use
our
power
the
greater
it
will
be
today
america
has
dual
responsibility
to
help
iraq
forge
better
future
and
to
leave
iraq
to
iraqis
and
have
made
it
clear
to
the
iraqi
people
have
made
it
clear
to
the
iraqi
people
that
we
pursue
no
bases
and
no
claim
on
their
territory
or
resources
iraq
sovereignty
is
its
own
and
that
why
ordered
the
removal
of
our
combat
brigades
by
next
august
that
is
why
we
will
our
agreement
with
iraq
democratically
elected
government
to
remove
combat
troops
from
iraqi
cities
by
july
and
to
remove
all
of
our
troops
from
iraq
by
we
will
help
iraq
train
its
security
forces
and
develop
its
economy
but
we
will
support
secure
and
united
iraq
as
partner
and
never
as
patron
and
finally
just
as
america
can
never
tolerate
violence
by
extremists
we
must
never
alter
or
forget
our
principles
was
an
enormous
trauma
to
our
country
the
fear
and
anger
that
it
provoked
was
understandable
but
in
some
cases
it
led
us
to
act
contrary
to
our
traditions
and
our
ideals
we
are
taking
concrete
actions
to
change
course
have
unequivocally
prohibited
the
use
of
torture
by
the
united
states
and
have
ordered
the
prison
at
bay
closed
by
early
next
year
so
america
will
defend
itself
respectful
of
the
sovereignty
of
nations
and
the
rule
of
law
and
we
will
do
so
in
partnership
with
muslim
communities
which
are
also
threatened
the
sooner
the
extremists
are
isolated
and
unwelcome
in
muslim
communities
the
sooner
we
will
all
be
safer
the
second
major
source
of
tension
that
we
need
to
discuss
is
the
situation
between
israelis
and
the
arab
world
america
strong
bonds
with
israel
are
well
known
this
bond
is
unbreakable
it
is
based
upon
cultural
and
historical
ties
and
the
recognition
that
the
aspiration
for
jewish
homeland
is
rooted
in
tragic
history
that
can
not
be
denied
around
the
world
the
jewish
people
were
persecuted
for
centuries
and
in
europe
culminated
in
an
unprecedented
holocaust
tomorrow
will
visit
which
was
part
of
network
of
camps
where
jews
were
enslaved
tortured
shot
and
gassed
to
death
by
the
third
reich
six
million
jews
were
killed
more
than
the
entire
jewish
population
of
israel
today
denying
that
fact
is
baseless
it
is
ignorant
and
it
is
hateful
threatening
israel
with
destruction
or
repeating
vile
stereotypes
about
jews
is
deeply
wrong
and
only
serves
to
evoke
in
the
minds
of
israelis
this
most
painful
of
memories
while
preventing
the
peace
that
the
people
of
this
region
deserve
on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
undeniable
that
the
people
muslims
and
has
suffered
in
pursuit
of
homeland
for
more
than
years
they
endured
the
pain
of
dislocation
many
wait
in
refugee
camps
in
the
west
bank
and
lands
for
life
of
peace
and
security
that
they
have
never
been
able
to
lead
they
endure
the
daily
humiliations
large
and
small
that
come
with
occupation
so
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
situation
for
the
people
is
intolerable
and
america
will
not
turn
our
backs
on
the
legitimate
aspiration
for
dignity
opportunity
and
state
of
their
own
for
decades
then
there
has
been
stalemate
two
peoples
with
legitimate
aspirations
each
with
painful
history
that
makes
compromise
elusive
it
easy
to
point
fingers
for
to
point
to
the
displacement
brought
about
by
israel
founding
and
for
israelis
to
point
to
the
constant
hostility
and
attacks
throughout
its
history
from
within
its
borders
as
well
as
beyond
but
if
we
see
this
conflict
only
from
one
side
or
the
other
then
we
will
be
blind
to
the
truth
the
only
resolution
is
for
the
aspirations
of
both
sides
to
be
met
through
two
states
where
israelis
and
each
live
in
peace
and
security
that
is
in
israel
interest
interest
america
interest
and
the
world
interest
and
that
is
why
intend
to
personally
pursue
this
outcome
with
all
the
patience
and
dedication
that
the
task
requires
the
obligations
the
obligations
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
under
the
road
map
are
clear
for
peace
to
come
it
is
time
for
them
and
all
of
us
to
live
up
to
our
responsibilities
must
abandon
violence
resistance
through
violence
and
killing
is
wrong
and
it
does
not
succeed
for
centuries
black
people
in
america
suffered
the
lash
of
the
whip
as
slaves
and
the
humiliation
of
segregation
but
it
was
not
violence
that
won
full
and
equal
rights
it
was
peaceful
and
determined
insistence
upon
the
ideals
at
the
of
america
founding
this
same
story
can
be
told
by
people
from
south
africa
to
south
asia
from
eastern
europe
to
it
story
with
simple
truth
violence
is
dead
end
it
is
sign
neither
of
courage
nor
power
to
shoot
rockets
at
sleeping
children
or
to
blow
up
old
women
on
bus
that
not
how
moral
authority
is
claimed
that
how
it
is
surrendered
now
is
the
time
for
to
focus
on
what
they
can
build
the
authority
must
develop
its
capacity
to
govern
with
institutions
that
serve
the
needs
of
its
peoples
does
have
support
among
some
but
they
also
have
to
they
have
responsibilities
to
play
role
in
fulfilling
aspirations
to
unify
the
people
must
put
an
end
to
violence
past
agreements
israel
right
to
exist
at
the
same
time
israelis
must
acknowledge
that
just
as
israel
right
to
exist
can
not
be
denied
neither
can
the
united
states
does
not
accept
the
legitimacy
of
continued
israeli
settlements
this
construction
violates
previous
agreements
and
undermines
efforts
to
achieve
peace
it
is
time
for
these
settlements
to
stop
and
israel
must
also
live
up
to
its
obligation
to
ensure
that
can
live
and
work
and
develop
their
society
just
as
it
families
the
continuing
humanitarian
crisis
in
does
not
serve
israel
security
neither
does
the
continuing
lack
of
opportunity
in
the
west
bank
progress
in
the
daily
lives
of
the
people
must
be
critical
part
of
road
to
peace
and
israel
must
take
concrete
steps
to
enable
such
progress
and
finally
the
arab
states
must
that
the
arab
peace
initiative
was
an
important
beginning
but
not
the
end
of
their
responsibilities
the
conflict
should
no
longer
be
used
to
distract
the
people
of
arab
nations
from
other
problems
instead
it
must
be
cause
for
action
to
help
the
people
develop
the
institutions
that
will
sustain
their
state
to
israel
legitimacy
and
to
choose
progress
over
focus
on
the
past
america
will
align
our
policies
with
those
who
pursue
peace
and
we
will
say
in
public
what
we
say
in
private
to
israelis
and
and
arabs
we
can
not
impose
peace
but
privately
many
muslims
that
israel
will
not
go
away
likewise
many
israelis
the
need
for
state
it
is
time
for
us
to
act
on
what
everyone
knows
to
be
true
too
many
tears
have
been
shed
too
much
blood
has
been
shed
all
of
us
have
responsibility
to
work
for
the
day
when
the
mothers
of
israelis
and
can
see
their
children
grow
up
without
fear
when
the
holy
land
of
the
three
great
faiths
is
the
place
of
peace
that
god
intended
it
to
be
when
is
secure
and
lasting
home
for
jews
and
and
muslims
and
place
for
all
of
the
children
of
abraham
to
mingle
peacefully
together
as
in
the
story
of
as
in
the
story
of
when
moses
jesus
and
peace
be
upon
them
joined
in
prayer
the
third
source
of
tension
is
our
shared
interest
in
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
nations
on
nuclear
weapons
this
issue
has
been
source
of
tension
between
the
united
states
and
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
for
many
years
iran
has
defined
itself
in
part
by
its
opposition
to
my
country
and
there
is
in
fact
tumultuous
history
between
us
in
the
middle
of
the
cold
war
the
united
states
played
role
in
the
overthrow
of
democratically
elected
iranian
government
since
the
islamic
revolution
iran
has
played
role
in
acts
of
and
violence
against
troops
and
civilians
this
history
is
well
known
rather
than
remain
trapped
in
the
past
made
it
clear
to
iran
leaders
and
people
that
my
country
is
prepared
to
move
forward
the
question
now
is
not
what
iran
is
against
but
rather
what
future
it
wants
to
build
it
will
be
hard
to
overcome
decades
of
mistrust
but
we
will
proceed
with
courage
rectitude
and
resolve
there
will
be
many
issues
to
discuss
between
our
two
countries
and
we
are
willing
to
move
forward
without
preconditions
on
the
basis
of
mutual
respect
but
it
is
clear
to
all
concerned
that
when
it
comes
to
nuclear
weapons
we
have
reached
decisive
point
this
is
not
simply
about
america
interests
it
about
preventing
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
middle
east
that
could
lead
this
region
and
the
world
down
hugely
dangerous
path
understand
those
who
protest
that
some
countries
have
weapons
that
others
do
not
no
single
nation
should
pick
and
choose
which
nation
holds
nuclear
weapons
and
that
why
strongly
reaffirmed
america
commitment
to
seek
world
in
which
no
nations
hold
nuclear
weapons
and
any
nation
including
iran
should
have
the
right
to
access
peaceful
nuclear
power
if
it
complies
with
its
responsibilities
under
the
nuclear
treaty
that
commitment
is
at
the
core
of
the
treaty
and
it
must
be
kept
for
all
who
fully
abide
by
it
and
am
hopeful
that
all
countries
in
the
region
can
share
in
this
goal
the
fourth
issue
that
will
address
is
democracy
know
know
there
has
been
controversy
about
the
promotion
of
democracy
in
recent
years
and
much
of
this
controversy
is
connected
to
the
war
in
iraq
so
let
me
be
clear
no
system
of
government
can
or
should
be
imposed
by
one
nation
by
any
other
that
does
not
lessen
my
commitment
however
to
governments
that
reflect
the
will
of
the
people
each
nation
gives
life
to
this
principle
in
its
own
way
grounded
in
the
traditions
of
its
own
people
america
does
not
presume
to
know
what
is
best
for
everyone
just
as
we
would
not
presume
to
pick
the
outcome
of
peaceful
election
but
do
have
an
unyielding
belief
that
all
people
yearn
for
certain
things
the
ability
to
speak
your
mind
and
have
say
in
how
you
are
governed
confidence
in
the
rule
of
law
and
the
equal
administration
of
justice
government
that
is
transparent
and
does
steal
from
the
people
the
freedom
to
live
as
you
choose
these
are
not
just
american
ideas
they
are
human
rights
and
that
is
why
we
will
support
them
everywhere
now
there
is
no
straight
line
to
this
promise
but
this
much
is
clear
governments
that
protect
these
rights
are
ultimately
more
stable
successful
and
secure
suppressing
ideas
never
succeeds
in
making
them
go
away
america
america
respects
the
right
of
all
peaceful
and
voices
to
be
heard
around
the
world
even
if
we
disagree
with
them
and
we
will
welcome
all
elected
peaceful
governments
provided
they
govern
with
respect
for
all
their
people
this
last
point
is
important
because
there
are
some
who
advocate
for
democracy
only
when
they
out
of
power
once
in
power
they
are
ruthless
in
suppressing
the
rights
of
others
so
no
matter
where
it
takes
hold
government
of
the
people
and
by
the
people
sets
single
standard
for
all
who
would
hold
power
you
must
maintain
your
power
through
consent
not
coercion
you
must
respect
the
rights
of
minorities
and
participate
with
spirit
of
tolerance
and
compromise
you
must
place
the
interests
of
your
people
and
the
legitimate
workings
of
the
political
process
above
your
party
without
these
ingredients
elections
alone
do
not
make
true
democracy
thank
you
the
fifth
issue
that
we
must
address
together
is
religious
freedom
islam
has
proud
tradition
of
tolerance
we
see
it
in
the
history
of
and
during
the
inquisition
saw
it
firsthand
as
child
in
where
devout
freely
in
an
overwhelmingly
muslim
country
that
is
the
spirit
we
need
today
people
in
every
country
should
be
free
to
choose
and
live
their
faith
based
upon
the
persuasion
of
the
mind
and
the
heart
and
the
soul
this
tolerance
is
essential
for
religion
to
thrive
but
it
being
challenged
in
many
different
ways
among
some
muslims
there
disturbing
tendency
to
measure
one
own
faith
by
the
rejection
of
somebody
else
faith
the
richness
of
religious
diversity
must
be
upheld
whether
it
is
for
in
lebanon
or
the
in
egypt
and
if
we
are
being
honest
fault
lines
must
be
closed
among
muslims
as
well
as
the
divisions
between
and
have
led
to
tragic
violence
particularly
in
iraq
freedom
of
religion
is
central
to
the
ability
of
peoples
to
live
together
we
must
always
examine
the
ways
in
which
we
protect
it
for
instance
in
the
united
states
rules
on
charitable
giving
have
made
it
harder
for
muslims
to
their
religious
obligation
that
why
committed
to
working
with
american
muslims
to
ensure
that
they
can
likewise
it
is
important
for
western
countries
to
avoid
impeding
muslim
citizens
from
religion
as
they
see
fit
for
instance
by
dictating
what
clothes
muslim
woman
should
wear
we
disguise
hostility
towards
any
religion
behind
the
pretence
of
liberalism
in
fact
faith
should
bring
us
together
and
that
why
we
forging
service
projects
in
america
to
bring
together
muslims
and
jews
that
why
we
welcome
efforts
like
saudi
arabian
king
dialogue
and
turkey
leadership
in
the
alliance
of
around
the
world
we
can
turn
dialogue
into
service
so
bridges
between
peoples
lead
to
action
whether
it
is
combating
malaria
in
africa
or
providing
relief
after
natural
disaster
the
sixth
issue
the
sixth
issue
that
want
to
address
is
women
rights
know
know
and
you
can
tell
from
this
audience
that
there
is
healthy
debate
about
this
issue
reject
the
view
of
some
in
the
west
that
woman
who
chooses
to
cover
her
hair
is
somehow
less
equal
but
do
believe
that
woman
who
is
denied
an
education
is
denied
equality
and
it
is
no
coincidence
that
countries
where
women
are
well
educated
are
far
more
likely
to
be
prosperous
now
let
me
be
clear
issues
of
women
equality
are
by
no
means
simply
an
issue
for
islam
in
turkey
pakistan
we
seen
countries
elect
woman
to
lead
meanwhile
the
struggle
for
women
equality
continues
in
many
aspects
of
american
life
and
in
countries
around
the
world
am
convinced
that
our
daughters
can
contribute
just
as
much
to
society
as
our
sons
our
common
prosperity
will
be
advanced
by
allowing
all
humanity
men
and
women
to
reach
their
full
potential
do
not
believe
that
women
must
make
the
same
choices
as
men
in
order
to
be
equal
and
respect
those
women
who
choose
to
live
their
lives
in
traditional
roles
but
it
should
be
their
choice
and
that
is
why
the
united
states
will
partner
with
any
country
to
support
expanded
literacy
for
girls
and
to
help
young
women
pursue
employment
through
that
helps
people
live
their
dreams
finally
want
to
discuss
economic
development
and
opportunity
know
that
for
many
the
face
of
is
contradictory
the
internet
and
television
can
bring
knowledge
and
information
but
also
offensive
sexuality
and
mindless
violence
into
the
home
trade
can
bring
new
wealth
and
opportunities
but
also
huge
disruptions
and
change
in
communities
in
all
nations
including
america
this
change
can
bring
fear
fear
that
because
of
modernity
we
lose
control
over
our
economic
choices
our
politics
and
most
importantly
our
identities
those
things
we
most
cherish
about
our
communities
our
families
our
traditions
and
our
faith
but
also
know
that
human
progress
can
not
be
denied
there
need
not
be
contradictions
between
development
and
tradition
countries
like
japan
and
south
korea
grew
their
economies
enormously
while
maintaining
distinct
cultures
the
same
is
true
for
the
astonishing
progress
within
countries
from
to
in
ancient
times
and
in
our
times
muslim
communities
have
been
at
the
forefront
of
innovation
and
education
and
this
is
important
because
no
development
strategy
can
be
based
only
upon
what
comes
out
of
the
ground
nor
can
it
be
sustained
while
young
people
are
out
of
work
many
gulf
states
have
enjoyed
great
wealth
as
consequence
of
oil
and
some
are
beginning
to
focus
it
on
broader
development
but
all
of
us
must
that
education
and
innovation
will
be
the
currency
of
the
century
and
in
too
and
in
too
many
muslim
communities
there
remains
underinvestment
in
these
areas
such
investment
within
my
own
country
and
while
america
in
the
past
has
focused
on
oil
and
gas
when
it
comes
to
this
part
of
the
world
we
now
seek
broader
engagement
on
education
we
will
expand
exchange
programs
and
increase
scholarships
like
the
one
that
brought
my
father
to
america
at
the
same
time
we
will
encourage
more
americans
to
study
in
muslim
communities
and
we
will
match
promising
muslim
students
with
in
america
invest
in
learning
for
teachers
and
children
around
the
world
and
create
new
network
so
young
person
in
can
communicate
instantly
with
young
person
in
cairo
on
economic
development
we
will
create
new
corps
of
business
volunteers
to
partner
with
counterparts
in
countries
and
will
host
summit
on
entrepreneurship
this
year
to
identify
how
we
can
deepen
ties
between
business
leaders
foundations
and
social
entrepreneurs
in
the
united
states
and
muslim
communities
around
the
world
on
science
and
technology
we
will
launch
new
fund
to
support
technological
development
in
countries
and
to
help
transfer
ideas
to
to
the
marketplace
so
they
can
create
more
jobs
we
open
of
scientific
excellence
in
africa
the
middle
east
and
asia
and
appoint
new
science
envoys
to
collaborate
on
programs
that
develop
new
sources
of
energy
create
green
jobs
records
clean
water
grow
new
crops
today
announcing
new
global
effort
with
the
of
the
islamic
conference
to
eradicate
polio
and
we
will
also
expand
partnerships
with
muslim
communities
to
promote
child
and
maternal
health
all
these
things
must
be
done
in
partnership
americans
are
ready
to
join
with
citizens
and
governments
community
religious
leaders
and
businesses
in
muslim
communities
around
the
world
to
help
our
people
pursue
better
life
now
the
issues
that
have
described
will
not
be
easy
to
address
but
we
have
responsibility
to
join
together
on
behalf
of
the
world
that
we
seek
world
where
extremists
no
longer
threaten
our
people
and
american
troops
have
come
home
world
where
israelis
and
are
each
secure
in
state
of
their
own
and
nuclear
energy
is
used
for
peaceful
purposes
world
where
governments
serve
their
citizens
and
the
rights
of
all
god
children
are
respected
those
are
mutual
interests
that
is
the
world
we
seek
but
we
can
only
achieve
it
together
know
there
are
many
muslim
and
who
question
whether
we
can
forge
this
new
beginning
some
are
eager
to
stoke
the
flames
of
division
and
to
stand
in
the
way
of
progress
some
suggest
that
it
is
worth
the
effort
that
we
are
fated
to
disagree
and
are
doomed
to
clash
many
more
are
simply
that
real
change
can
occur
there
so
much
fear
so
much
mistrust
that
has
built
up
over
the
years
but
if
we
choose
to
be
bound
by
the
past
we
will
never
move
forward
and
want
to
particularly
say
this
to
young
people
of
every
faith
in
every
country
you
more
than
anyone
have
the
ability
to
the
world
to
remake
this
world
all
of
us
share
this
world
for
but
brief
moment
in
time
the
question
is
whether
we
spend
that
time
focused
on
what
pushes
us
apart
or
whether
we
commit
ourselves
to
an
effort
sustained
effort
to
find
common
ground
to
focus
on
the
future
we
seek
for
our
children
and
to
respect
the
dignity
of
all
human
beings
it
easier
to
start
wars
than
to
end
them
it
easier
to
blame
others
than
to
look
inward
it
easier
to
see
what
is
different
about
someone
than
to
find
the
things
we
share
but
we
should
choose
the
right
path
not
just
the
easy
path
there
one
rule
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
every
religion
that
we
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
this
truth
transcends
nations
and
peoples
belief
that
is
new
that
is
black
or
white
or
brown
that
is
christian
or
muslim
or
jew
it
belief
that
pulsed
in
the
cradle
of
and
that
still
beats
in
the
hearts
of
billions
around
the
world
it
faith
in
other
people
and
it
what
brought
me
here
today
we
have
the
power
to
make
the
world
we
seek
but
only
if
we
have
the
courage
to
make
new
beginning
keeping
in
mind
what
has
been
written
the
holy
tells
us
mankind
we
have
created
you
male
and
female
and
we
have
made
you
into
nations
and
tribes
so
that
you
may
know
one
another
the
talmud
tells
us
the
whole
of
the
torah
is
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
peace
the
holy
bible
tells
us
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
sons
of
god
the
people
of
the
world
can
live
together
in
peace
we
know
that
is
god
vision
now
that
must
be
our
work
here
on
earth
thank
you
and
may
god
peace
be
upon
you
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
we
meet
today
at
transformational
moment
moment
in
history
when
our
interconnected
world
presents
us
at
once
with
great
promise
but
also
great
peril
now
over
the
past
four
months
my
administration
has
taken
decisive
steps
to
seize
the
promise
and
confront
these
perils
we
working
to
recover
from
global
recession
while
laying
new
foundation
for
lasting
prosperity
we
strengthening
our
armed
forces
as
they
fight
two
wars
at
the
same
time
we
renewing
american
leadership
to
confront
unconventional
challenges
from
nuclear
proliferation
to
terrorism
from
climate
change
to
pandemic
disease
and
we
bringing
to
government
and
to
this
white
house
unprecedented
transparency
and
accountability
and
new
ways
for
americans
to
participate
in
their
democracy
but
none
of
this
progress
would
be
possible
and
none
of
these
century
challenges
can
be
fully
met
without
america
digital
infrastructure
the
backbone
that
underpins
prosperous
economy
and
strong
military
and
an
open
and
efficient
government
without
that
foundation
we
get
the
job
done
it
long
been
said
that
the
revolutions
in
communications
and
information
technology
have
given
birth
to
virtual
world
but
make
no
mistake
this
world
cyberspace
is
world
that
we
depend
on
every
single
day
it
our
hardware
and
our
software
our
desktops
and
laptops
and
cell
phones
and
blackberries
that
have
become
woven
into
every
aspect
of
our
lives
it
the
broadband
networks
beneath
us
and
the
wireless
signals
around
us
the
local
networks
in
our
schools
and
hospitals
and
businesses
and
the
massive
grids
that
power
our
nation
it
the
classified
military
and
intelligence
networks
that
keep
us
safe
and
the
world
wide
web
that
has
made
us
more
interconnected
than
at
any
time
in
human
history
so
cyberspace
is
real
and
so
are
the
risks
that
come
with
it
it
the
great
irony
of
our
information
age
the
very
technologies
that
empower
us
to
create
and
to
build
also
empower
those
who
would
disrupt
and
destroy
and
this
paradox
seen
and
unseen
is
something
that
we
experience
every
day
it
about
the
privacy
and
the
economic
security
of
american
families
we
rely
on
the
internet
to
pay
our
bills
to
bank
to
shop
to
file
our
taxes
but
we
had
to
learn
whole
new
vocabulary
just
to
stay
ahead
of
the
criminals
who
would
do
us
harm
and
and
and
and
millions
of
americans
have
been
their
privacy
violated
their
identities
stolen
their
lives
upended
and
their
wallets
emptied
according
to
one
survey
in
the
past
two
years
alone
crime
has
cost
americans
more
than
billion
dollars
know
how
it
feels
to
have
privacy
violated
because
it
has
happened
to
me
and
the
people
around
me
it
no
secret
that
my
presidential
campaign
harnessed
the
internet
and
technology
to
transform
our
politics
what
is
widely
known
is
that
during
the
general
election
hackers
managed
to
penetrate
our
computer
systems
to
all
of
you
who
donated
to
our
campaign
want
you
to
all
rest
assured
our
fundraising
website
was
untouched
so
your
confidential
personal
and
financial
information
was
protected
but
between
august
and
october
hackers
gained
access
to
and
range
of
campaign
files
from
policy
position
papers
to
travel
plans
and
we
worked
closely
with
the
with
the
and
the
secret
service
and
hired
security
consultants
to
restore
the
security
of
our
systems
it
was
powerful
reminder
in
this
information
age
one
of
your
greatest
strengths
in
our
case
our
ability
to
communicate
to
wide
range
of
supporters
through
the
internet
could
also
be
one
of
your
greatest
vulnerabilities
this
is
matter
as
well
of
america
economic
competitiveness
the
small
businesswoman
in
louis
the
bond
trader
in
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
workers
at
global
shipping
company
in
memphis
the
young
entrepreneur
in
silicon
valley
they
all
need
the
networks
to
make
the
next
payroll
the
next
trade
the
next
delivery
the
next
great
breakthrough
alone
last
year
accounted
for
some
billion
dollars
in
retail
sales
but
every
day
we
see
waves
of
thieves
trolling
for
sensitive
information
the
disgruntled
employee
on
the
inside
the
lone
hacker
thousand
miles
away
crime
the
industrial
spy
and
increasingly
foreign
intelligence
services
in
one
brazen
act
last
year
thieves
used
stolen
credit
card
information
to
steal
millions
of
dollars
from
machines
in
cities
around
the
world
and
they
did
it
in
just
minutes
single
employee
of
an
american
company
was
convicted
of
stealing
intellectual
property
reportedly
worth
million
dollars
it
been
estimated
that
last
year
alone
criminals
stole
intellectual
property
from
businesses
worldwide
worth
up
to
trillion
dollars
in
short
america
economic
prosperity
in
the
century
will
depend
on
and
this
is
also
matter
of
public
safety
and
national
security
we
count
on
computer
networks
to
deliver
our
oil
and
gas
our
power
and
our
water
we
rely
on
them
for
public
transportation
and
air
traffic
control
yet
we
know
that
intruders
have
probed
our
electrical
grid
and
that
in
other
countries
attacks
have
plunged
entire
cities
into
darkness
our
technological
advantage
is
key
to
america
military
dominance
but
our
and
military
networks
are
under
constant
attack
and
other
terrorist
groups
have
spoken
of
their
desire
to
unleash
attack
on
our
country
attacks
that
are
harder
to
detect
and
harder
to
defend
against
indeed
in
today
world
acts
of
terror
could
come
not
only
from
few
extremists
in
suicide
vests
but
from
few
key
strokes
on
the
computer
weapon
of
mass
disruption
in
one
of
the
most
serious
incidents
to
date
against
our
military
networks
several
thousand
computers
were
infected
last
year
by
malicious
software
and
while
no
sensitive
information
was
compromised
our
troops
and
personnel
had
to
give
up
those
external
memory
devices
thumb
drives
changing
the
way
they
used
their
computers
every
day
and
last
year
we
had
glimpse
of
the
future
face
of
war
as
russian
tanks
rolled
into
georgia
attacks
crippled
government
the
terrorists
that
sowed
so
much
death
and
destruction
in
relied
not
only
on
guns
and
grenades
but
also
on
and
phones
using
for
all
these
reasons
it
now
clear
this
threat
is
one
of
the
most
serious
economic
and
national
security
challenges
we
face
as
nation
it
also
clear
that
we
not
as
prepared
as
we
should
be
as
government
or
as
country
in
recent
years
some
progress
has
been
made
at
the
federal
level
but
just
as
we
failed
in
the
past
to
invest
in
our
physical
infrastructure
our
roads
our
bridges
and
rails
we
failed
to
invest
in
the
security
of
our
digital
infrastructure
no
single
official
oversees
policy
across
the
federal
government
and
no
single
agency
has
the
responsibility
or
authority
to
match
the
scope
and
scale
of
the
challenge
indeed
when
it
comes
to
federal
agencies
have
overlapping
missions
and
do
coordinate
and
communicate
nearly
as
well
as
they
should
with
each
other
or
with
the
private
sector
we
saw
this
in
the
response
to
the
internet
worm
that
in
recent
months
has
infected
millions
of
computers
around
the
world
this
status
is
no
longer
acceptable
not
when
there
so
much
at
stake
we
can
and
we
must
do
better
and
that
why
shortly
after
taking
office
directed
my
national
security
council
and
homeland
security
council
to
conduct
review
of
the
federal
government
efforts
to
defend
our
information
and
communications
infrastructure
and
to
recommend
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
these
networks
are
able
to
secure
our
networks
as
well
as
our
prosperity
our
review
was
open
and
transparent
want
to
acknowledge
who
is
here
who
is
the
acting
senior
director
for
cyberspace
on
our
national
security
council
who
led
the
review
team
as
well
as
the
for
strategic
and
international
studies
bipartisan
commission
on
and
all
who
were
part
of
our
review
team
they
listened
to
wide
variety
of
groups
many
of
which
are
represented
here
today
and
want
to
thank
for
their
input
industry
and
academia
civil
liberties
and
private
privacy
advocates
we
listened
to
every
level
and
branch
of
government
from
local
to
state
to
federal
civilian
military
homeland
as
well
as
intelligence
congress
and
international
partners
as
well
consulted
with
my
national
security
teams
my
homeland
security
teams
and
my
economic
today
releasing
report
on
our
review
and
can
announce
that
my
administration
will
pursue
new
comprehensive
approach
to
securing
america
digital
infrastructure
this
new
approach
starts
at
the
top
with
this
commitment
from
me
from
now
on
our
digital
infrastructure
the
networks
and
computers
we
depend
on
every
day
will
be
treated
as
they
should
be
as
strategic
national
asset
protecting
this
infrastructure
will
be
national
security
priority
we
will
ensure
that
these
networks
are
secure
trustworthy
and
resilient
we
will
deter
prevent
detect
and
defend
against
attacks
and
recover
quickly
from
any
disruptions
or
damage
to
give
these
efforts
the
focus
and
attention
they
deserve
and
as
part
of
the
new
single
national
security
staff
announced
this
week
creating
new
office
here
at
the
white
house
that
will
be
led
by
the
coordinator
because
of
the
critical
importance
of
this
work
will
personally
select
this
official
depend
on
this
official
in
all
matters
relating
to
and
this
official
will
have
my
full
support
and
regular
access
to
me
as
we
confront
these
challenges
today
want
to
focus
on
the
important
responsibilities
this
office
will
orchestrating
and
integrating
all
policies
for
the
government
working
closely
with
the
office
of
management
and
budget
to
ensure
agency
budgets
reflect
those
priorities
and
in
the
event
of
major
incident
or
attack
coordinating
our
response
to
ensure
that
federal
policies
enhance
our
security
and
our
prosperity
my
coordinator
will
be
member
of
the
national
security
staff
as
well
as
the
staff
of
my
national
economic
council
to
ensure
that
policies
keep
faith
with
our
fundamental
values
this
office
will
also
include
an
official
with
portfolio
specifically
dedicated
to
safeguarding
the
privacy
and
civil
liberties
of
the
american
people
there
much
work
to
be
done
and
the
report
we
releasing
today
outlines
range
of
actions
that
we
will
pursue
in
five
key
areas
first
working
in
partnership
with
the
communities
represented
here
today
we
will
develop
new
comprehensive
strategy
to
secure
america
information
and
communications
networks
to
ensure
coordinated
approach
across
government
my
coordinator
will
work
closely
with
my
chief
technology
officer
and
my
chief
information
officer
to
ensure
accountability
in
federal
agencies
will
be
designated
as
one
of
my
key
management
priorities
clear
milestones
and
performances
metrics
will
measure
progress
and
as
we
develop
our
strategy
we
will
be
open
and
transparent
which
is
why
you
find
today
report
and
wealth
of
related
information
on
our
web
site
second
we
will
work
with
all
the
key
players
including
state
and
local
governments
and
the
private
sector
to
ensure
an
and
unified
response
to
future
incidents
given
the
enormous
damage
that
can
be
caused
by
even
single
attack
responses
will
not
do
nor
is
it
sufficient
to
simply
strengthen
our
defenses
after
incidents
or
attacks
occur
just
as
we
do
for
natural
disasters
we
have
to
have
plans
and
resources
in
place
beforehand
sharing
information
issuing
warnings
and
ensuring
coordinated
response
third
we
will
strengthen
the
partnerships
that
are
critical
to
this
the
vast
majority
of
our
critical
information
infrastructure
in
the
united
states
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
private
sector
so
let
me
be
very
clear
my
administration
will
not
dictate
security
standards
for
private
companies
on
the
contrary
we
will
collaborate
with
industry
to
find
technology
solutions
that
ensure
our
security
and
promote
prosperity
fourth
we
will
continue
to
invest
in
the
research
and
development
necessary
for
the
innovation
and
discovery
we
need
to
meet
the
digital
challenges
of
our
time
and
that
why
my
administration
is
making
major
investments
in
our
information
infrastructure
laying
broadband
lines
to
every
corner
of
america
building
smart
electric
grid
to
deliver
energy
more
efficiently
pursuing
next
generation
of
air
traffic
control
systems
and
moving
to
electronic
health
records
with
privacy
protections
to
reduce
costs
and
save
lives
and
finally
we
will
begin
national
campaign
to
promote
awareness
and
digital
literacy
from
our
boardrooms
to
our
classrooms
and
to
build
digital
workforce
for
the
century
and
that
why
we
making
new
commitment
to
education
in
math
and
science
and
historic
investments
in
science
and
research
and
development
because
it
not
enough
for
our
children
and
students
to
master
today
technologies
social
networking
and
and
and
we
need
them
to
pioneer
the
technologies
that
will
allow
us
to
work
effectively
through
these
new
media
and
allow
us
to
prosper
in
the
future
so
these
are
the
things
we
will
do
let
me
also
be
clear
about
what
we
will
not
do
our
pursuit
of
will
not
repeat
will
not
include
monitoring
private
sector
networks
or
internet
traffic
we
will
preserve
and
protect
the
personal
privacy
and
civil
liberties
that
we
cherish
as
americans
indeed
remain
firmly
committed
to
net
neutrality
so
we
can
keep
the
internet
as
it
should
be
open
and
free
the
task
have
described
will
not
be
easy
some
billion
people
around
the
world
are
already
and
more
are
logging
on
every
day
groups
and
governments
are
sharpening
their
capabilities
protecting
our
prosperity
and
security
in
this
world
is
going
to
be
long
difficult
struggle
demanding
patience
and
persistence
over
many
years
but
we
need
to
remember
we
only
at
the
beginning
the
epochs
of
history
are
long
the
agricultural
revolution
the
industrial
revolution
by
comparison
our
information
age
is
still
in
its
infancy
we
only
at
web
now
our
virtual
world
is
going
viral
and
we
only
just
begun
to
explore
the
next
generation
of
technologies
that
will
transform
our
lives
in
ways
we
even
begin
to
imagine
so
new
world
awaits
world
of
greater
security
and
greater
potential
prosperity
if
we
reach
for
it
if
we
lead
so
long
as
president
of
the
united
states
we
will
do
just
that
and
the
united
states
the
nation
that
invented
the
internet
that
launched
an
information
revolution
that
transformed
the
world
will
do
what
we
did
in
the
century
and
lead
once
more
in
the
thank

very
much

great

in
intelligence
matters
want
to
thank
congressman
congressman
congressman

as
well
as
congressman
for
being
here
today
thank
you
so
much
these
are
extraordinary
times
for
our
country
we
confronting
historic
economic
crisis
we
fighting
two
wars
we
face
range
of
challenges
that
will
define
the
way
that
americans
will
live
in
the
century
so
there
no
shortage
of
work
to
be
done
or
responsibilities
to
bear
and
we
begun
to
make
progress
just
this
week
we
taken
steps
to
protect
american
consumers
and
homeowners
and
to
reform
our
system
of
government
contracting
so
that
we
better
protect
our
people
while
spending
our
money
more
wisely
the
it
good
bill
the
engines
of
our
economy
are
slowly
beginning
to
turn
and
we
working
towards
historic
reform
on
health
care
and
on
energy
want
to
say
to
the
members
of
congress
welcome
all
the
extraordinary
work
that
has
been
done
over
these
last
four
months
on
these
and
other
issues
in
the
midst
of
all
these
challenges
however
my
single
most
important
responsibility
as
president
is
to
keep
the
american
people
safe
it
the
first
thing
that
think
about
when
wake
up
in
the
morning
it
the
last
thing
that
think
about
when
go
to
sleep
at
night
and
this
responsibility
is
only
magnified
in
an
era
when
an
extremist
ideology
threatens
our
people
and
technology
gives
handful
of
terrorists
the
potential
to
do
us
great
harm
we
are
less
than
eight
years
removed
from
the
deadliest
attack
on
american
soil
in
our
history
we
know
that
is
actively
planning
to
attack
us
again
we
know
that
this
threat
will
be
with
us
for
long
time
and
that
we
must
use
all
elements
of
our
power
to
defeat
it
already
we
taken
several
steps
to
achieve
that
goal
for
the
first
time
since
we
providing
the
necessary
resources
and
strategic
direction
to
take
the
fight
to
the
extremists
who
attacked
us
on
in
and
pakistan
we
investing
in
the
century
military
and
intelligence
capabilities
that
will
allow
us
to
stay
one
step
ahead
of
nimble
enemy
we
have
global
regime
to
deny
the
world
most
dangerous
people
access
to
the
world
deadliest
weapons
and
we
launched
an
effort
to
secure
all
loose
nuclear
materials
within
four
years
we
better
protecting
our
border
and
increasing
our
preparedness
for
any
future
attack
or
natural
disaster
we
building
new
partnerships
around
the
world
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
and
its
affiliates
and
we
have
renewed
american
diplomacy
so
that
we
once
again
have
the
strength
and
standing
to
truly
lead
the
world
these
steps
are
all
critical
to
keeping
america
secure
but
believe
with
every
of
my
being
that
in
the
long
run
we
also
can
not
keep
this
country
safe
unless
we
enlist
the
power
of
our
most
fundamental
values
the
documents
that
we
hold
in
this
very
hall
the
declaration
of
independence
the
constitution
the
bill
of
rights
these
are
not
simply
words
written
into
aging
parchment
they
are
the
foundation
of
liberty
and
justice
in
this
country
and
light
that
shines
for
all
who
seek
freedom
fairness
equality
and
dignity
around
the
world
stand
here
today
as
someone
whose
own
life
was
made
possible
by
these
documents
my
father
came
to
these
shores
in
search
of
the
promise
that
they
offered
my
mother
made
me
rise
before
dawn
to
learn
their
truths
when
lived
as
child
in
foreign
land
my
own
american
journey
was
paved
by
generations
of
citizens
who
gave
meaning
to
those
simple
words
to
form
more
perfect
union
studied
the
constitution
as
student
taught
it
as
teacher
been
bound
by
it
as
lawyer
and
legislator
took
an
oath
to
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
as
and
as
citizen
know
that
we
must
never
ever
turn
our
back
on
its
enduring
principles
for
expedience
sake
make
this
claim
not
simply
as
matter
of
idealism
we
uphold
our
most
cherished
values
not
only
because
doing
so
is
right
but
because
it
strengthens
our
country
and
it
keeps
us
safe
time
and
again
our
values
have
been
our
best
national
security
asset
in
war
and
peace
in
times
of
ease
and
in
eras
of
upheaval
fidelity
to
our
values
is
the
reason
why
the
united
states
of
america
grew
from
small
string
of
colonies
under
the
writ
of
an
empire
to
the
strongest
nation
in
the
world
it
the
reason
why
enemy
soldiers
have
surrendered
to
us
in
battle
knowing
they
receive
better
treatment
from
america
armed
forces
than
from
their
own
government
it
the
reason
why
america
has
from
strong
alliances
that
amplified
our
power
and
drawn
sharp
moral
contrast
with
our
adversaries
it
the
reason
why
we
been
able
to
overpower
the
iron
fist
of
fascism
and
outlast
the
iron
curtain
of
communism
and
enlist
free
nations
and
free
peoples
everywhere
in
the
common
cause
and
common
effort
of
liberty
from
europe
to
the
pacific
we
been
the
nation
that
has
shut
down
torture
chambers
and
replaced
tyranny
with
the
rule
of
law
that
is
who
we
are
and
where
terrorists
offer
only
the
injustice
of
disorder
and
destruction
america
must
demonstrate
that
our
values
and
our
institutions
are
more
resilient
than
hateful
ideology
after
we
knew
that
we
had
entered
new
era
that
enemies
who
did
not
abide
by
any
law
of
war
would
present
new
challenges
to
our
application
of
the
law
that
our
government
would
need
new
tools
to
protect
the
american
people
and
that
these
tools
would
have
to
allow
us
to
prevent
attacks
instead
of
simply
prosecuting
those
who
try
to
carry
them
out
unfortunately
faced
with
an
uncertain
threat
our
government
made
series
of
hasty
decisions
believe
that
many
of
these
decisions
were
motivated
by
sincere
desire
to
protect
the
american
people
but
also
believe
that
all
too
often
our
government
made
decisions
based
on
fear
rather
than
foresight
that
all
too
often
our
government
trimmed
facts
and
evidence
to
fit
ideological
predispositions
instead
of
strategically
applying
our
power
and
our
principles
too
often
we
set
those
principles
aside
as
luxuries
that
we
could
no
longer
afford
and
during
this
season
of
fear
too
many
of
us
democrats
and
republicans
politicians
journalists
and
citizens
fell
silent
in
other
words
we
went
off
course
and
this
is
not
my
assessment
alone
it
was
an
assessment
that
was
shared
by
the
american
people
who
nominated
candidates
for
president
from
both
major
parties
who
despite
our
many
differences
called
for
new
approach
one
that
rejected
torture
and
one
that
the
imperative
of
closing
the
prison
at
bay
now
let
me
be
clear
we
are
indeed
at
war
with
and
its
affiliates
we
do
need
to
update
our
institutions
to
deal
with
this
threat
but
we
must
do
so
with
an
abiding
confidence
in
the
rule
of
law
and
due
process
in
checks
and
balances
and
accountability
for
reasons
that
will
explain
the
decisions
that
were
made
over
the
last
eight
years
established
an
legal
approach
for
fighting
terrorism
that
was
neither
effective
nor
sustainable
framework
that
failed
to
rely
on
our
legal
traditions
and
institutions
and
that
failed
to
use
our
values
as
compass
and
that
why
took
several
steps
upon
taking
office
to
better
protect
the
american
people
first
banned
the
use
of
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
by
the
united
states
of
america
know
some
have
argued
that
brutal
methods
like
were
necessary
to
keep
us
safe
could
not
disagree
more
as
see
the
intelligence
bear
the
responsibility
for
keeping
this
country
safe
and
categorically
reject
the
assertion
that
these
are
the
most
effective
means
of
interrogation
what
more
they
undermine
the
rule
of
law
they
alienate
us
in
the
world
they
serve
as
recruitment
tool
for
terrorists
and
increase
the
will
of
our
enemies
to
fight
us
while
decreasing
the
will
of
others
to
work
with
america
they
risk
the
lives
of
our
troops
by
making
it
less
likely
that
others
will
surrender
to
them
in
battle
and
more
likely
that
americans
will
be
mistreated
if
they
are
captured
in
short
they
did
not
advance
our
war
and
efforts
they
undermined
them
and
that
is
why
ended
them
once
and
for
all
now
should
add
the
arguments
against
these
techniques
did
not
originate
from
my
administration
as
senator
once
said
torture
serves
as
great
propaganda
tool
for
those
who
recruit
people
to
fight
against
us
and
even
under
president
bush
there
was
recognition
among
members
of
his
own
administration
including
secretary
of
state
other
senior
officials
and
many
in
the
military
and
intelligence
community
that
those
who
argued
for
these
tactics
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
debate
and
the
wrong
side
of
history
that
why
we
must
leave
these
methods
where
they
belong
in
the
past
they
are
not
who
we
are
and
they
are
not
america
the
second
decision
that
made
was
to
order
the
closing
of
the
prison
camp
at
bay
for
over
seven
years
we
have
detained
hundreds
of
people
at
during
that
time
the
system
of
military
commissions
that
were
in
place
at
succeeded
in
convicting
grand
total
of
three
suspected
terrorists
let
me
repeat
that
three
convictions
in
over
seven
years
instead
of
bringing
terrorists
to
justice
efforts
at
prosecution
met
setback
after
setback
cases
lingered
on
and
in
the
supreme
court
invalidated
the
entire
system
meanwhile
over
detainees
were
released
from
under
not
my
administration
under
the
previous
administration
let
me
repeat
that
of
the
detainees
were
released
before
took
office
and
ordered
the
closure
of
there
is
also
no
question
that
set
back
the
moral
authority
that
is
america
strongest
currency
in
the
world
instead
of
building
durable
framework
for
the
struggle
against
that
drew
upon
our
deeply
held
values
and
traditions
our
government
was
defending
positions
that
undermined
the
rule
of
law
in
fact
part
of
the
rationale
for
establishing
in
the
first
place
was
the
misplaced
notion
that
prison
there
would
be
beyond
the
law
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
soundly
rejected
meanwhile
instead
of
serving
as
tool
to
counter
terrorism
became
symbol
that
helped
recruit
terrorists
to
its
cause
indeed
the
existence
of
likely
created
more
terrorists
around
the
world
than
it
ever
detained
so
the
record
is
clear
rather
than
keeping
us
safer
the
prison
at
has
weakened
american
national
security
it
is
rallying
cry
for
our
enemies
it
sets
back
the
willingness
of
our
allies
to
work
with
us
in
fighting
an
enemy
that
operates
in
scores
of
countries
by
any
measure
the
costs
of
keeping
it
open
far
exceed
the
complications
involved
in
closing
it
that
why
argued
that
it
should
be
closed
throughout
my
campaign
and
that
is
why
ordered
it
closed
within
one
year
the
third
decision
that
made
was
to
order
review
of
all
pending
cases
at
knew
when
ordered
closed
that
it
would
be
difficult
and
complex
there
are
people
there
who
have
now
spent
years
in
legal
limbo
in
dealing
with
this
situation
we
do
have
the
luxury
of
starting
from
scratch
we
cleaning
up
something
that
is
quite
simply
mess
misguided
experiment
that
has
left
in
its
wake
flood
of
legal
challenges
that
my
administration
is
forced
to
deal
with
on
constant
almost
daily
basis
and
it
consumes
the
time
of
government
officials
whose
time
should
be
spent
on
better
protecting
our
country
indeed
the
legal
challenges
that
have
sparked
so
much
debate
in
recent
weeks
here
in
washington
would
be
taking
place
whether
or
not
decided
to
close
for
example
the
court
order
to
release
detainees
took
place
last
fall
when
george
bush
was
president
the
supreme
court
that
invalidated
the
system
of
prosecution
at
in
was
overwhelmingly
appointed
by
republican
presidents
not
liberals
in
other
words
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
detainees
was
not
caused
by
my
decision
to
close
the
facility
the
problem
exists
because
of
the
decision
to
open
in
the
first
place
now
let
me
be
blunt
there
are
no
neat
or
easy
answers
here
wish
there
were
but
can
tell
you
that
the
wrong
answer
is
to
pretend
like
this
problem
will
go
away
if
we
maintain
an
unsustainable
status
as
president
refuse
to
allow
this
problem
to
fester
refuse
to
pass
it
on
to
somebody
else
it
is
my
responsibility
to
solve
the
problem
our
security
interests
will
not
permit
us
to
delay
our
courts
allow
it
and
neither
should
our
conscience
now
over
the
last
several
weeks
we
seen
return
of
the
of
these
issues
that
have
the
last
several
years
an
elected
official
understand
these
problems
arouse
passions
and
concerns
they
should
we
confronting
some
of
the
most
complicated
questions
that
democracy
can
face
but
have
no
interest
in
spending
all
of
our
time
the
policies
of
the
last
eight
years
leave
that
to
others
want
to
solve
these
problems
and
want
to
solve
them
together
as
americans
and
we
will
be
by
some
of
the
that
emerges
whenever
we
discuss
this
issue
listening
to
the
recent
debate
heard
words
that
frankly
are
calculated
to
scare
people
rather
than
educate
them
words
that
have
more
to
do
with
politics
than
protecting
our
country
so
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
lay
out
what
we
are
doing
and
how
we
intend
to
resolve
these
outstanding
issues
will
explain
how
each
action
that
we
are
taking
will
help
build
framework
that
protects
both
the
american
people
and
the
values
that
we
hold
most
dear
and
focus
on
two
broad
areas
first
issues
relating
to
and
our
detention
policy
but
second
also
want
to
discuss
issues
relating
to
security
and
transparency
now
let
me
begin
by
disposing
of
one
argument
as
plainly
as
can
we
are
not
going
to
release
anyone
if
it
would
endanger
our
national
security
nor
will
we
release
detainees
within
the
united
states
who
endanger
the
american
people
where
demanded
by
justice
and
national
security
we
will
seek
to
transfer
some
detainees
to
the
same
type
of
facilities
in
which
we
hold
all
manner
of
dangerous
and
violent
criminals
within
our
borders
namely
highly
secure
prisons
that
ensure
the
public
safety
as
we
make
these
decisions
bear
in
mind
the
following
face
nobody
has
ever
escaped
from
one
of
our
federal
prisons
which
hold
hundreds
of
convicted
terrorists
as
republican
graham
said
the
idea
that
we
can
not
find
place
to
securely
house
detainees
within
the
united
states
is
not
rational
we
are
currently
in
the
process
of
reviewing
each
of
the
detainee
cases
at
to
determine
the
appropriate
policy
for
dealing
with
them
and
as
we
do
so
we
are
acutely
aware
that
under
the
last
administration
detainees
were
released
and
in
some
cases
returned
to
the
battlefield
that
why
we
are
doing
away
with
the
poorly
planned
haphazard
approach
that
let
those
detainees
go
in
the
past
instead
we
are
treating
these
cases
with
the
care
and
attention
that
the
law
requires
and
that
our
security
demands
now
going
forward
these
cases
will
fall
into
five
distinct
categories
first
whenever
feasible
we
will
try
those
who
have
violated
american
criminal
laws
in
federal
courts
courts
provided
for
by
the
united
states
constitution
some
have
derided
our
federal
courts
as
incapable
of
handling
the
trials
of
terrorists
they
are
wrong
our
courts
and
our
juries
our
citizens
are
tough
enough
to
convict
terrorists
the
record
makes
that
clear
tried
to
blow
up
the
world
trade
he
was
convicted
in
our
courts
and
is
serving
life
sentence
in
prisons
has
been
identified
as
the
hijacker
he
was
convicted
in
our
courts
and
he
too
is
serving
life
sentence
in
prison
if
we
can
try
those
terrorists
in
our
courts
and
hold
them
in
our
prisons
then
we
can
do
the
same
with
detainees
from
recently
we
prosecuted
and
received
guilty
plea
from
detainee
in
federal
court
after
years
of
legal
confusion
we
preparing
to
transfer
another
detainee
to
the
southern
district
court
of
new
york
where
he
will
face
trial
on
charges
related
to
the
bombings
of
our
embassies
in
kenya
and
tanzania
bombings
that
killed
over
people
preventing
this
detainee
from
coming
to
our
shores
would
prevent
his
trial
and
conviction
and
after
over
decade
it
is
time
to
finally
see
that
justice
is
served
and
that
is
what
we
intend
to
do
the
second
category
of
cases
involves
detainees
who
violate
the
laws
of
war
and
are
therefore
best
tried
through
military
commissions
military
commissions
have
history
in
the
united
states
dating
back
to
george
washington
and
the
revolutionary
war
they
are
an
appropriate
venue
for
trying
detainees
for
violations
of
the
laws
of
war
they
allow
for
the
protection
of
sensitive
sources
and
methods
of
they
allow
for
the
safety
and
security
of
participants
and
for
the
presentation
of
evidence
gathered
from
the
battlefield
that
can
not
always
be
effectively
presented
in
federal
courts
now
some
have
suggested
that
this
represents
reversal
on
my
part
they
should
look
at
the
record
in
did
strongly
oppose
legislation
proposed
by
the
bush
administration
and
passed
by
the
congress
because
it
failed
to
establish
legitimate
legal
framework
with
the
kind
of
meaningful
due
process
rights
for
the
accused
that
could
stand
up
on
appeal
said
at
that
time
however
that
supported
the
use
of
military
commissions
to
try
detainees
provided
there
were
several
reforms
and
in
fact
there
were
some
bipartisan
efforts
to
achieve
those
reforms
those
are
the
reforms
that
we
are
now
making
instead
of
using
the
flawed
commissions
of
the
last
seven
years
my
administration
is
bringing
our
commissions
in
line
with
the
rule
of
law
we
will
no
longer
permit
the
use
of
evidence
as
evidence
statements
that
have
been
obtained
using
cruel
inhuman
or
degrading
interrogation
methods
we
will
no
longer
place
the
burden
to
prove
that
hearsay
is
unreliable
on
the
opponent
of
the
hearsay
and
we
will
give
detainees
greater
latitude
in
selecting
their
own
counsel
and
more
protections
if
they
refuse
to
testify
these
reforms
among
others
will
make
our
military
commissions
more
credible
and
effective
means
of
administering
justice
and
will
work
with
congress
and
members
of
both
parties
as
well
as
legal
authorities
across
the
political
spectrum
on
legislation
to
ensure
that
these
commissions
are
fair
legitimate
and
effective
the
third
category
of
detainees
includes
those
who
have
been
ordered
released
by
the
courts
now
let
me
repeat
what
said
earlier
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
decision
to
close
it
has
to
do
with
the
rule
of
law
the
courts
have
spoken
they
have
found
that
there
no
legitimate
reason
to
hold
of
the
people
currently
held
at
nineteen
of
these
findings
took
place
before
was
sworn
into
office
can
not
ignore
these
rulings
because
as
president
too
am
bound
by
the
law
the
united
states
is
nation
of
laws
and
so
we
must
abide
by
these
rulings
the
fourth
category
of
cases
involves
detainees
who
we
have
determined
can
be
transferred
safely
to
another
country
so
far
our
review
team
has
approved
detainees
for
transfer
and
my
administration
is
in
ongoing
discussions
with
number
of
other
countries
about
the
transfer
of
detainees
to
their
soil
for
detention
and
rehabilitation
now
finally
there
remains
the
question
of
detainees
at
who
can
not
be
prosecuted
yet
who
pose
clear
danger
to
the
american
people
and
have
to
be
honest
here
this
is
the
toughest
single
issue
that
we
will
face
we
going
to
exhaust
every
avenue
that
we
have
to
prosecute
those
at
who
pose
danger
to
our
country
but
even
when
this
process
is
complete
there
may
be
number
of
people
who
can
not
be
prosecuted
for
past
crimes
in
some
cases
because
evidence
may
be
tainted
but
who
nonetheless
pose
threat
to
the
security
of
the
united
states
examples
of
that
threat
include
people
who
received
extensive
explosives
training
at
training
camps
or
commanded
troops
in
battle
or
expressed
their
allegiance
to
bin
laden
or
otherwise
made
it
clear
that
they
want
to
kill
americans
these
are
people
who
in
effect
remain
at
war
with
the
united
states
let
me
repeat
am
not
going
to
release
individuals
who
endanger
the
american
people
terrorists
and
their
affiliates
are
at
war
with
the
united
states
and
those
that
we
capture
like
other
prisoners
of
war
must
be
prevented
from
attacking
us
again
having
said
that
we
must
that
these
detention
policies
can
not
be
unbounded
they
be
based
simply
on
what
or
the
executive
branch
decide
alone
that
why
my
administration
has
begun
to
reshape
the
standards
that
apply
to
ensure
that
they
are
in
line
with
the
rule
of
law
we
must
have
clear
defensible
and
lawful
standards
for
those
who
fall
into
this
category
we
must
have
fair
procedures
so
that
we
do
make
mistakes
we
must
have
thorough
process
of
periodic
review
so
that
any
prolonged
detention
is
carefully
evaluated
and
justified
know
that
creating
such
system
poses
unique
challenges
and
other
countries
have
grappled
with
this
question
now
so
must
we
but
want
to
be
very
clear
that
our
goal
is
to
construct
legitimate
legal
framework
for
the
remaining
detainees
that
can
not
be
transferred
our
goal
is
not
to
avoid
legitimate
legal
framework
in
our
constitutional
system
prolonged
detention
should
not
be
the
decision
of
any
one
man
if
and
when
we
determine
that
the
united
states
must
hold
individuals
to
keep
them
from
carrying
out
an
act
of
war
we
will
do
so
within
system
that
involves
judicial
and
congressional
oversight
and
so
going
forward
my
administration
will
work
with
congress
to
develop
an
appropriate
legal
regime
so
that
our
efforts
are
consistent
with
our
values
and
our
constitution
now
as
our
efforts
to
close
move
forward
know
that
the
politics
in
congress
will
be
difficult
these
are
issues
that
are
fodder
for
commercials
you
can
almost
picture
the
direct
mail
pieces
that
emerge
from
any
vote
on
this
issue
designed
to
frighten
the
population
get
it
but
if
we
continue
to
make
decisions
within
climate
of
fear
we
will
make
more
mistakes
and
if
we
refuse
to
deal
with
these
issues
today
then
guarantee
you
that
they
will
be
an
albatross
around
our
efforts
to
combat
terrorism
in
the
future
have
confidence
that
the
american
people
are
more
interested
in
doing
what
is
right
to
protect
this
country
than
in
political
posturing
am
not
the
only
person
in
this
city
who
swore
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
so
did
each
and
every
member
of
congress
and
together
we
have
responsibility
to
enlist
our
values
in
the
effort
to
secure
our
people
and
to
leave
behind
the
legacy
that
makes
it
easier
for
future
presidents
to
keep
this
country
safe
now
let
me
touch
on
second
set
of
issues
that
relate
to
security
and
transparency
national
security
requires
delicate
balance
one
the
one
hand
our
democracy
depends
on
transparency
on
the
other
hand
some
information
must
be
protected
from
public
disclosure
for
the
sake
of
our
security
for
instance
the
movement
of
our
troops
our
or
the
information
we
have
about
terrorist
and
its
affiliates
in
these
and
other
cases
lives
are
at
stake
now
several
weeks
ago
as
part
of
an
ongoing
court
case
released
issued
by
the
previous
administration
office
of
legal
counsel
did
not
do
this
because
disagreed
with
the
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
that
those
and
did
release
the
documents
because
rejected
their
legal
rationales
although
do
on
both
counts
released
the
because
the
existence
of
that
approach
to
interrogation
was
already
widely
known
the
bush
administration
had
acknowledged
its
existence
and
had
already
banned
those
methods
the
argument
that
somehow
by
releasing
those
we
are
providing
terrorists
with
information
about
how
they
will
be
interrogated
makes
no
sense
we
will
not
be
interrogating
terrorists
using
that
approach
that
approach
is
now
prohibited
in
short
released
these
because
there
was
no
overriding
reason
to
protect
them
and
the
ensuing
debate
has
helped
the
american
people
better
understand
how
these
interrogation
methods
came
to
be
and
used
on
the
other
hand
recently
opposed
the
release
of
certain
photographs
that
were
taken
of
detainees
by
personnel
between
and
individuals
who
violated
standards
of
in
these
photos
have
been
investigated
and
they
have
been
held
accountable
there
was
and
is
no
debate
as
to
whether
what
is
reflected
in
those
photos
is
wrong
nothing
has
been
concealed
to
absolve
perpetrators
of
crimes
however
it
was
my
judgment
informed
by
my
national
security
team
that
releasing
these
photos
would
inflame
opinion
and
allow
our
enemies
to
paint
troops
with
broad
damning
and
inaccurate
brush
thereby
endangering
them
in
of
war
in
short
there
is
clear
and
compelling
reason
to
not
release
these
particular
photos
there
are
nearly
americans
who
are
serving
in
harm
way
and
have
solemn
responsibility
for
their
safety
as
nothing
would
be
gained
by
the
release
of
these
photos
that
matters
more
than
the
lives
of
our
young
men
and
women
serving
in
harm
way
now
in
the
press
mind
and
in
some
of
the
public
mind
these
two
cases
are
contradictory
they
are
not
to
me
in
each
of
these
cases
had
to
strike
the
right
balance
between
transparency
and
national
security
and
this
balance
brings
with
it
precious
responsibility
there
no
doubt
that
the
american
people
have
seen
this
balance
tested
over
the
last
several
years
in
the
images
from
and
the
brutal
interrogation
techniques
made
public
long
before
was
president
the
american
people
learned
of
actions
taken
in
their
name
that
bear
no
resemblance
to
the
ideals
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
for
and
whether
it
was
the
to
the
iraq
war
or
the
revelation
of
secret
programs
americans
often
felt
like
part
of
the
story
had
been
unnecessarily
withheld
from
them
and
that
caused
suspicion
to
build
up
and
that
leads
to
thirst
for
accountability
understand
that
ran
for
president
promising
transparency
and
meant
what
said
and
that
why
whenever
possible
my
administration
will
make
all
information
available
to
the
american
people
so
that
they
can
make
informed
judgments
and
hold
us
accountable
but
have
never
argued
and
never
will
that
our
most
sensitive
national
security
matters
should
simply
be
an
open
book
will
never
abandon
and
will
vigorously
defend
the
necessity
of
classification
to
defend
our
troops
at
war
to
protect
sources
and
methods
and
to
safeguard
confidential
actions
that
keep
the
american
people
safe
here
the
difference
though
whenever
we
can
not
release
certain
information
to
the
public
for
valid
national
security
reasons
will
insist
that
there
is
oversight
of
my
actions
by
congress
or
by
the
courts
we
currently
launching
review
of
current
policies
by
all
those
agencies
responsible
for
the
classification
of
documents
to
determine
where
reforms
are
possible
and
to
assure
that
the
other
branches
of
government
will
be
in
position
to
review
executive
branch
decisions
on
these
matters
because
in
our
system
of
checks
and
balances
someone
must
always
watch
over
the
watchers
especially
when
it
comes
to
sensitive
administration
information
now
along
these
same
lines
my
administration
is
also
confronting
challenges
to
what
is
known
as
the
state
secrets
privilege
this
is
doctrine
that
allows
the
government
to
challenge
legal
cases
involving
secret
programs
it
been
used
by
many
past
presidents
republican
and
democrat
for
many
decades
and
while
this
principle
is
absolutely
necessary
in
some
circumstances
to
protect
national
security
am
concerned
that
it
has
been
it
is
also
currently
the
subject
of
wide
range
of
lawsuits
so
let
me
lay
out
some
principles
here
we
must
not
protect
information
merely
because
it
reveals
the
violation
of
law
or
embarrassment
to
the
government
and
that
why
my
administration
is
nearing
completion
of
thorough
review
of
this
practice
and
we
plan
to
embrace
several
principles
for
reform
we
will
apply
stricter
legal
test
to
material
that
can
be
protected
under
the
state
secrets
privilege
we
will
not
assert
the
privilege
in
court
without
first
following
our
own
formal
process
including
review
by
justice
department
committee
and
the
personal
approval
of
the
attorney
general
and
each
year
we
will
voluntarily
report
to
congress
when
we
have
invoked
the
privilege
and
why
because
as
said
before
there
must
be
proper
oversight
over
our
actions
on
all
these
matters
related
to
the
disclosure
of
sensitive
information
wish
could
say
that
there
was
some
simple
formula
out
there
to
be
had
there
is
not
these
often
involve
tough
calls
involve
competing
concerns
and
they
require
surgical
approach
but
the
common
thread
that
runs
through
all
of
my
decisions
is
simple
we
will
safeguard
what
we
must
to
protect
the
american
people
but
we
will
also
ensure
the
accountability
and
oversight
that
is
the
hallmark
of
our
constitutional
system
will
never
hide
the
truth
because
it
uncomfortable
will
deal
with
congress
and
the
courts
as
branches
of
government
will
tell
the
american
people
what
know
and
do
know
and
when
release
something
publicly
or
keep
something
secret
will
tell
you
why
now
in
all
the
areas
that
discussed
today
the
policies
that
proposed
represent
new
direction
from
the
last
eight
years
to
protect
the
american
people
and
our
values
we
banned
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
we
are
closing
the
prison
at
we
are
reforming
military
commissions
and
we
will
pursue
new
legal
regime
to
detain
terrorists
we
are
more
information
and
embracing
more
oversight
of
our
actions
and
we
narrowing
our
use
of
the
state
secrets
privilege
these
are
dramatic
changes
that
will
put
our
approach
to
national
security
on
surer
safer
and
more
sustainable
footing
their
implementation
will
take
time
but
they
will
get
done
there
core
principle
that
we
will
apply
to
all
of
our
actions
even
as
we
clean
up
the
mess
at
we
will
constantly
our
approach
subject
our
decisions
to
review
from
other
branches
of
government
as
well
as
the
public
we
seek
the
strongest
and
most
sustainable
legal
framework
for
addressing
these
issues
in
the
long
term
not
to
serve
immediate
politics
but
to
do
what
right
over
the
long
term
by
doing
that
we
can
leave
behind
legacy
that
outlasts
my
administration
my
presidency
that
endures
for
the
next
president
and
the
president
after
that
legacy
that
protects
the
american
people
and
enjoys
broad
legitimacy
at
home
and
abroad
now
this
is
what
mean
when
say
that
we
need
to
focus
on
the
future
that
many
still
have
strong
desire
to
focus
on
the
past
when
it
comes
to
actions
of
the
last
eight
years
passions
are
high
some
americans
are
angry
others
want
to
debates
that
have
been
settled
in
some
cases
debates
that
they
have
lost
know
that
these
debates
lead
directly
in
some
cases
to
call
for
fuller
accounting
perhaps
through
an
independent
commission
opposed
the
creation
of
such
commission
because
believe
that
our
existing
democratic
institutions
are
strong
enough
to
deliver
accountability
the
congress
can
review
abuses
of
our
values
and
there
are
ongoing
inquiries
by
the
congress
into
matters
like
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
the
department
of
justice
and
our
courts
can
work
through
and
punish
any
violations
of
our
laws
or
miscarriages
of
justice
it
no
secret
there
is
tendency
in
washington
to
spend
our
time
pointing
fingers
at
one
another
and
it
no
secret
that
our
media
culture
feeds
the
impulse
that
lead
to
good
fight
and
good
copy
but
nothing
will
contribute
more
than
that
than
extended
of
the
last
eight
years
already
we
seen
how
that
kind
of
effort
only
leads
those
in
washington
to
different
sides
to
laying
blame
it
can
distract
us
from
focusing
our
time
our
efforts
and
our
politics
on
the
challenges
of
the
future
we
see
that
above
all
in
the
recent
debate
how
the
recent
debate
has
obscured
the
truth
and
sends
people
into
opposite
and
absolutist
ends
on
the
one
side
of
the
spectrum
there
are
those
who
make
little
allowance
for
the
unique
challenges
posed
by
terrorism
and
would
almost
never
put
national
security
over
transparency
and
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
there
are
those
who
embrace
view
that
can
be
in
two
words
anything
goes
their
arguments
suggest
that
the
ends
of
fighting
terrorism
can
be
used
to
justify
any
means
and
that
the
president
should
have
blanket
authority
to
do
whatever
he
wants
provided
it
is
president
with
whom
they
agree
both
sides
may
be
sincere
in
their
views
but
neither
side
is
right
the
american
people
are
not
absolutist
and
they
do
elect
us
to
impose
rigid
ideology
on
our
problems
they
know
that
we
need
not
sacrifice
our
security
for
our
values
nor
sacrifice
our
values
for
our
security
so
long
as
we
approach
difficult
questions
with
honesty
and
care
and
dose
of
common
sense
that
after
all
is
the
unique
genius
of
america
that
the
challenge
laid
down
by
our
constitution
that
has
been
the
source
of
our
strength
through
the
ages
that
what
makes
the
united
states
of
america
different
as
nation
can
stand
here
today
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
say
without
exception
or
equivocation
that
we
do
not
torture
and
that
we
will
vigorously
protect
our
people
while
forging
strong
and
durable
framework
that
allows
us
to
fight
terrorism
while
abiding
by
the
rule
of
law
make
no
mistake
if
we
fail
to
turn
the
page
on
the
approach
that
was
taken
over
the
past
several
years
then
will
not
be
able
to
say
that
as
president
and
if
we
can
not
stand
for
our
core
values
then
we
are
not
keeping
faith
with
the
documents
that
are
enshrined
in
this
hall
the
framers
who
drafted
the
constitution
could
not
have
foreseen
the
challenges
that
have
unfolded
over
the
last
years
but
our
constitution
has
endured
through
secession
and
civil
rights
through
world
war
and
cold
war
because
it
provides
foundation
of
principles
that
can
be
applied
pragmatically
it
provides
compass
that
can
help
us
find
our
way
it
has
always
been
easy
we
are
an
imperfect
people
every
now
and
then
there
are
those
who
think
that
america
safety
and
success
requires
us
to
walk
away
from
the
sacred
principles
enshrined
in
this
building
and
we
hear
such
voices
today
but
over
the
long
haul
the
american
people
have
resisted
that
temptation
and
though
we
made
our
share
of
mistakes
required
some
course
corrections
ultimately
we
have
held
fast
to
the
principles
that
have
been
the
source
of
our
strength
and
beacon
to
the
world
now
this
generation
faces
great
test
in
the
of
terrorism
and
unlike
the
civil
war
or
world
war
we
count
on
surrender
ceremony
to
bring
this
journey
to
an
end
right
now
in
distant
training
camps
and
in
crowded
cities
there
are
people
plotting
to
take
american
lives
that
will
be
the
case
year
from
now
five
years
from
now
and
in
all
probability
years
from
now
neither
nor
anyone
can
stand
here
today
and
say
that
there
will
not
be
another
terrorist
attack
that
takes
american
lives
but
can
say
with
certainty
that
my
administration
along
with
our
extraordinary
troops
and
the
patriotic
men
and
women
who
defend
our
national
security
will
do
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
the
american
people
safe
and
do
know
with
certainty
that
we
can
defeat
because
the
terrorists
can
only
succeed
if
they
swell
their
ranks
and
alienate
america
from
our
allies
and
they
will
never
be
able
to
do
that
if
we
stay
true
to
who
we
are
if
we
forge
tough
and
durable
approaches
to
fighting
terrorism
that
are
anchored
in
our
timeless
ideals
this
must
be
our
common
purpose
ran
for
president
because
believe
that
we
can
not
solve
the
challenges
of
our
time
unless
we
solve
them
together
we
will
not
be
safe
if
we
see
national
security
as
wedge
that
divides
america
it
can
and
must
be
cause
that
unites
us
as
one
people
and
as
one
nation
we
done
so
before
in
times
that
were
more
perilous
than
ours
we
will
do
so
once
again
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
president
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
dame
thank
you
thank
you
please
have
seat
thank
you
well
first
of
all
congratulations
class
of
congratulations
to
all
the
parents
the
cousins
the
aunts
the
uncles
the
all
the
people
who
helped
to
bring
you
to
the
point
that
you
are
here
today
thank
you
so
much
to
father
for
that
extraordinary
introduction
even
though
you
said
what
want
to
say
much
more
elegantly
you
are
doing
an
extraordinary
job
as
president
of
this
extraordinary
institution
and
your
continued
and
courageous
and
contagious
commitment
to
honest
thoughtful
dialogue
is
an
inspiration
to
us
all
so
good
afternoon
to
father
to
dame
trustees
to
faculty
to
family
am
to
be
here
today
and
am
grateful
to
all
of
you
for
allowing
me
to
be
part
of
your
graduation
and
also
want
to
thank
you
for
the
honorary
degree
that
received
know
it
has
not
been
without
controversy
do
know
if
you
aware
of
this
but
these
honorary
degrees
are
apparently
pretty
hard
to
come
by
so
far
only
for
as
president
father
is
for
guess
that
better
so
father
ted
after
the
ceremony
maybe
you
can
give
me
some
pointers
to
boost
my
average
also
want
to
congratulate
the
class
of
for
all
your
accomplishments
and
since
audience
member
interrupts
with
slogans
president
and
since
this
is
dame
mean
that
all
right
and
since
audience
chants
we
are
we
are
president
we
fine
everybody
we
we
following
adage
that
we
do
do
things
easily
we
want
to
we
we
not
going
to
shy
away
from
things
that
are
uncomfortable
sometimes
now
since
since
this
is
dame
think
we
should
talk
not
only
about
your
accomplishments
in
the
classroom
but
also
in
the
competitive
arena
no
do
worry
not
going
to
talk
about
that
we
all
know
about
this
university
proud
and
football
team
but
also
hear
that
dame
holds
the
largest
outdoor
basketball
tournament
in
the
world
basketball
now
this
excites
me
want
to
congratulate
the
winners
of
this
year
tournament
team
by
the
name
of
hallelujah
back
congratulations
well
done
though
have
to
say
personally
disappointed
that
the
did
not
pull
it
out
this
year
so
next
year
if
you
need
forward
with
decent
jumper
you
know
where
live
now
every
one
of
you
should
be
proud
of
what
you
achieved
at
this
institution
one
hundred
and
classes
of
dame
graduates
have
sat
where
you
sit
today
some
were
here
during
years
that
simply
rolled
into
the
next
without
much
notice
or
fanfare
periods
of
relative
peace
and
prosperity
that
required
little
by
way
of
sacrifice
or
struggle
you
however
are
not
getting
off
that
easy
you
have
different
deal
your
class
has
come
of
age
at
moment
of
great
consequence
for
our
nation
and
for
the
world
rare
inflection
point
in
history
where
the
size
and
scope
of
the
challenges
before
us
require
that
we
remake
our
world
to
renew
its
promise
that
we
align
our
deepest
values
and
commitments
to
the
demands
of
new
age
it
privilege
and
responsibility
afforded
to
few
generations
and
task
that
you
now
called
to
this
generation
your
generation
is
the
one
that
must
find
path
back
to
prosperity
and
decide
how
we
respond
to
global
economy
that
left
millions
behind
even
before
the
most
recent
crisis
hit
an
economy
where
greed
and
thinking
were
too
often
rewarded
at
the
expense
of
fairness
and
diligence
and
an
honest
day
work
your
generation
your
generation
must
decide
how
to
save
god
creation
from
changing
climate
that
threatens
to
destroy
it
your
generation
must
seek
peace
at
time
when
there
are
those
who
will
stop
at
nothing
to
do
us
harm
and
when
weapons
in
the
hands
of
few
can
destroy
the
many
and
we
must
find
way
to
reconcile
our
world
with
its
diversity
diversity
of
thought
diversity
of
culture
and
diversity
of
belief
in
short
we
must
find
way
to
live
together
as
one
human
family
and
and
it
this
last
challenge
that
like
to
talk
about
today
despite
the
fact
that
father
john
stole
all
my
best
lines
for
the
major
threats
we
face
in
the
century
whether
it
global
recession
or
violent
extremism
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
or
pandemic
disease
these
things
do
not
discriminate
they
do
not
borders
they
do
not
see
they
do
not
target
specific
ethnic
groups
moreover
no
one
person
or
religion
or
nation
can
meet
these
challenges
alone
our
very
survival
has
never
required
greater
cooperation
and
greater
understanding
among
all
people
from
all
places
than
at
this
moment
in
history
unfortunately
finding
that
common
ground
that
our
fates
are
tied
up
as
king
said
in
single
garment
of
destiny
is
not
easy
and
part
of
the
problem
of
course
lies
in
the
imperfections
of
man
our
selfishness
our
pride
our
stubbornness
our
acquisitiveness
our
insecurities
our
all
the
cruelties
large
and
small
that
those
of
us
in
the
christian
tradition
understand
to
be
rooted
in
original
sin
we
too
often
seek
advantage
over
others
we
cling
to
prejudice
and
fear
those
who
are
unfamiliar
too
many
of
us
view
life
only
through
the
lens
of
immediate
and
crass
materialism
in
which
the
world
is
necessarily
game
the
strong
too
often
dominate
the
weak
and
too
many
of
those
with
wealth
and
with
power
find
all
manner
of
justification
for
their
own
privilege
in
the
face
of
poverty
and
injustice
and
so
for
all
our
technology
and
scientific
advances
we
see
here
in
this
country
and
around
the
globe
violence
and
want
and
strife
that
would
seem
sadly
familiar
to
those
in
ancient
times
we
know
these
things
and
hopefully
one
of
the
benefits
of
the
wonderful
education
that
you
have
received
here
at
dame
is
that
you
had
time
to
consider
these
wrongs
in
the
world
perhaps
impulses
in
yourself
that
you
want
to
leave
behind
you
grown
determined
each
in
your
own
way
to
right
them
and
yet
one
of
the
vexing
things
for
those
of
us
interested
in
promoting
greater
understanding
and
cooperation
among
people
is
the
discovery
that
even
bringing
together
persons
of
good
will
bringing
together
men
and
women
of
principle
and
purpose
even
accomplishing
that
can
be
difficult
the
soldier
and
the
lawyer
may
both
love
this
country
with
equal
passion
and
yet
reach
very
different
conclusions
on
the
specific
steps
needed
to
protect
us
from
harm
the
gay
activist
and
the
evangelical
pastor
may
both
deplore
the
ravages
of
but
find
themselves
unable
to
bridge
the
cultural
divide
that
might
unite
their
efforts
those
who
speak
out
against
stem
cell
research
may
be
rooted
in
an
admirable
conviction
about
the
sacredness
of
life
but
so
are
the
parents
of
child
with
juvenile
diabetes
who
are
convinced
that
their
son
or
daughter
hardships
might
be
relieved
the
the
question
then
the
question
then
is
how
do
we
work
through
these
conflicts
is
it
possible
for
us
to
join
hands
in
common
effort
as
citizens
of
vibrant
and
varied
democracy
how
do
we
engage
in
vigorous
debate
how
does
each
of
us
remain
firm
in
our
principles
and
fight
for
what
we
consider
right
without
as
father
john
said
those
with
just
as
strongly
held
convictions
on
the
other
side
and
of
course
nowhere
do
these
questions
come
up
more
powerfully
than
on
the
issue
of
abortion
as
considered
the
controversy
surrounding
my
visit
here
was
reminded
of
an
encounter
had
during
my
senate
campaign
one
that
describe
in
book
wrote
called
the
audacity
of
hope
in
few
days
after
won
the
democratic
nomination
received
an
from
doctor
who
told
me
that
while
he
voted
for
me
in
the
illinois
primary
he
had
serious
concern
that
might
prevent
him
from
voting
for
me
in
the
general
election
he
described
himself
as
christian
who
was
strongly
but
that
was
not
what
was
preventing
him
potentially
from
voting
for
me
what
bothered
the
doctor
was
an
entry
that
my
campaign
staff
had
posted
on
my
website
an
entry
that
said
would
fight
quote
ideologues
who
want
to
take
away
woman
right
to
choose
unquote
the
doctor
said
he
had
assumed
was
reasonable
person
he
supported
my
policy
initiatives
to
help
the
poor
and
to
lift
up
our
educational
system
but
that
if
truly
believed
that
every
individual
was
simply
an
ideologue
who
wanted
to
inflict
suffering
on
women
then
was
not
very
reasonable
he
wrote
do
not
ask
at
this
point
that
you
oppose
abortion
only
that
you
speak
about
this
issue
in
words
words
after
read
the
doctor
letter
wrote
back
to
him
and
thanked
him
and
did
change
my
underlying
position
but
did
tell
my
staff
to
change
the
words
on
my
website
and
said
prayer
that
night
that
might
extend
the
same
presumption
of
good
faith
to
others
that
the
doctor
had
extended
to
me
because
when
we
do
that
when
we
open
up
our
hearts
and
our
minds
to
those
who
may
not
think
precisely
like
we
do
or
believe
precisely
what
we
believe
that
when
we
discover
at
least
the
possibility
of
common
ground
that
when
we
begin
to
say
maybe
we
agree
on
abortion
but
we
can
still
agree
that
this
decision
for
any
woman
is
not
made
casually
and
it
has
both
moral
and
spiritual
dimensions
so
let
us
work
together
to
reduce
the
number
of
women
seeking
abortions
let
reduce
unintended
pregnancies
let
make
adoption
more
available
let
let
provide
care
and
support
for
women
who
do
carry
their
children
to
term
let
the
conscience
of
those
who
disagree
with
abortion
and
draft
sensible
conscience
clause
and
make
sure
that
all
of
our
health
care
policies
are
grounded
not
only
in
sound
science
but
also
in
clear
ethics
as
well
as
respect
for
the
equality
of
women
those
are
things
we
can
do
now
understand
understand
class
of
do
not
suggest
that
the
debate
surrounding
abortion
can
or
should
go
away
because
no
matter
how
much
we
may
want
to
fudge
it
indeed
while
we
know
that
the
views
of
most
americans
on
the
subject
are
complex
and
even
contradictory
the
fact
is
that
at
some
level
the
views
of
the
two
camps
are
irreconcilable
each
side
will
continue
to
make
its
case
to
the
public
with
passion
and
conviction
but
surely
we
can
do
so
without
reducing
those
with
differing
views
to
caricature
open
hearts
open
minds
words
it
way
of
life
that
has
always
been
the
dame
tradition
you
know
father
father
has
long
spoken
of
this
institution
as
both
lighthouse
and
crossroads
lighthouse
that
stands
apart
shining
with
the
wisdom
of
the
catholic
tradition
while
the
crossroads
is
where
differences
of
culture
and
religion
and
conviction
can
with
friendship
civility
hospitality
and
especially
love
and
want
to
join
him
and
father
john
in
saying
how
inspired
am
by
the
maturity
and
responsibility
with
which
this
class
has
approached
the
debate
surrounding
today
ceremony
you
are
an
example
of
what
dame
is
about
now
this
tradition
of
cooperation
and
understanding
is
one
that
learned
in
my
own
life
many
years
ago
also
with
the
help
of
the
catholic
church
you
see
was
not
raised
in
particularly
religious
household
but
my
mother
instilled
in
me
sense
of
service
and
empathy
that
eventually
led
me
to
become
community
after
graduated
college
and
group
of
catholic
churches
in
chicago
helped
fund
an
known
as
the
developing
communities
project
and
we
worked
to
lift
up
south
side
that
had
been
devastated
when
the
local
steel
plant
closed
and
it
was
quite
an
eclectic
crew
catholic
and
protestant
churches
jewish
and
african
american
black
white
and
hispanic
residents
all
of
us
with
different
experiences
all
of
us
with
different
beliefs
but
all
of
us
learned
to
work
side
by
side
because
all
of
us
saw
in
these
other
human
beings
who
needed
our
help
to
find
jobs
and
improve
schools
we
were
bound
together
in
the
service
of
others
and
something
else
happened
during
the
time
spent
in
these
perhaps
because
the
church
folks
worked
with
were
so
welcoming
and
understanding
perhaps
because
they
invited
me
to
their
services
and
sang
with
me
from
their
perhaps
because
was
really
broke
and
they
fed
me
perhaps
because
witnessed
all
of
the
good
works
their
faith
inspired
them
to
perform
found
myself
drawn
not
just
to
the
work
with
the
church
was
drawn
to
be
in
the
church
it
was
through
this
service
that
was
brought
to
christ
and
at
the
time
cardinal
joseph
was
the
archbishop
of
chicago
and
for
those
of
you
for
those
of
you
too
young
to
have
known
him
or
known
of
him
he
was
kind
and
good
and
wise
man
saintly
man
can
still
remember
him
speaking
at
one
of
the
first
meetings
attended
on
the
south
side
he
stood
as
both
lighthouse
and
crossroads
unafraid
to
speak
his
mind
on
moral
issues
ranging
from
poverty
and
aids
and
abortion
to
the
death
penalty
and
nuclear
war
and
yet
he
was
congenial
and
gentle
in
his
persuasion
always
trying
to
bring
people
together
always
trying
to
find
common
ground
and
just
before
he
died
reporter
asked
cardinal
about
this
approach
to
his
ministry
and
he
said
you
really
get
on
with
preaching
the
gospel
until
you
touched
hearts
and
minds
my
heart
and
mind
were
touched
by
him
they
were
touched
by
the
words
and
deeds
of
the
men
and
women
worked
alongside
in
parishes
across
chicago
and
like
to
think
that
we
touched
the
hearts
and
minds
of
the
families
whose
lives
we
helped
change
for
this
believe
is
our
highest
calling
now
you
class
of
are
about
to
enter
the
next
phase
of
your
life
at
time
of
great
uncertainty
you
be
called
to
help
restore
free
market
that
also
fair
to
all
who
are
willing
to
work
you
be
called
to
seek
new
sources
of
energy
that
can
save
our
planet
to
give
future
generations
the
same
chance
that
you
had
to
receive
an
extraordinary
education
and
whether
as
person
drawn
to
public
service
or
simply
someone
who
insists
on
being
an
active
citizen
you
will
be
exposed
to
more
opinions
and
ideas
broadcast
through
more
means
of
communication
than
ever
existed
before
you
hear
talking
heads
scream
on
cable
and
you
read
that
claim
definitive
knowledge
and
you
will
watch
politicians
pretend
they
know
what
they
talking
about
occasionally
you
may
have
the
great
fortune
of
actually
seeing
important
issues
debated
by
people
who
do
know
what
they
talking
about
by
people
with
brilliant
minds
and
mastery
of
the
facts
in
fact
suspect
that
some
of
you
will
be
among
those
brightest
stars
and
in
this
world
of
competing
claims
about
what
is
right
and
what
is
true
have
confidence
in
the
values
with
which
you
been
raised
and
educated
be
unafraid
to
speak
your
mind
when
those
values
are
at
stake
hold
firm
to
your
faith
and
allow
it
to
guide
you
on
your
journey
in
other
words
stand
as
lighthouse
but
remember
too
that
you
can
be
crossroads
remember
too
that
the
ultimate
irony
of
faith
is
that
it
necessarily
admits
doubt
it
the
belief
in
things
not
seen
it
beyond
our
capacity
as
human
beings
to
know
with
certainty
what
god
has
planned
for
us
or
what
he
asks
of
us
and
those
of
us
who
believe
must
trust
that
his
wisdom
is
greater
than
our
own
and
this
doubt
should
not
push
us
away
our
faith
but
it
should
humble
us
it
should
temper
our
passions
cause
us
to
be
wary
of
too
much
it
should
compel
us
to
remain
open
and
curious
and
eager
to
continue
the
spiritual
and
moral
debate
that
began
for
so
many
of
you
within
the
walls
of
dame
and
within
our
vast
democracy
this
doubt
should
remind
us
even
as
we
cling
to
our
faith
to
persuade
through
reason
through
an
appeal
whenever
we
can
to
universal
rather
than
parochial
principles
and
most
of
all
through
an
abiding
example
of
good
works
and
charity
and
kindness
and
service
that
moves
hearts
and
minds
for
if
there
is
one
law
that
we
can
be
most
certain
of
it
is
the
law
that
binds
people
of
all
faiths
and
no
faith
together
it
no
coincidence
that
it
exists
in
and
judaism
in
islam
and
hinduism
in
buddhism
and
humanism
it
is
of
course
the
golden
rule
the
call
to
treat
one
another
as
we
wish
to
be
treated
the
call
to
love
the
call
to
serve
to
do
what
we
can
to
make
difference
in
the
lives
of
those
with
whom
we
share
the
same
brief
moment
on
this
earth
so
many
of
you
at
dame
by
the
last
count
upwards
of
percent
have
lived
this
law
of
love
through
the
service
you
performed
at
schools
and
hospitals
international
relief
agencies
and
local
charities
is
just
one
example
of
what
your
class
has
accomplished
that
incredibly
impressive
powerful
testament
to
this
institution
and
now
now
you
must
carry
the
tradition
forward
make
it
way
of
life
because
when
you
serve
it
does
just
improve
your
community
it
makes
you
part
of
your
community
it
breaks
down
walls
it
fosters
cooperation
and
when
that
happens
when
when
people
set
aside
their
differences
even
for
moment
to
work
in
common
effort
toward
common
goal
when
they
struggle
together
and
sacrifice
together
and
learn
from
one
another
then
all
things
are
possible
after
all
stand
here
today
as
president
and
as
an
african
american
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
that
the
supreme
court
handed
down
the
decision
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
now
brown
was
of
course
the
first
major
step
in
dismantling
the
separate
but
equal
doctrine
but
it
would
take
number
of
years
and
nationwide
movement
to
fully
the
dream
of
civil
rights
for
all
of
god
children
there
were
freedom
rides
and
lunch
counters
and
billy
clubs
and
there
was
also
civil
rights
commission
appointed
by
president
it
was
the
resolutions
recommended
by
this
commission
that
would
ultimately
become
law
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
there
were
six
members
of
this
commission
it
included
five
whites
and
one
african
american
democrats
and
republicans
two
southern
governors
the
dean
of
southern
law
school
university
president
and
your
own
father
ted
president
of
dame
so
they
worked
for
two
years
and
at
times
president
had
to
intervene
personally
since
no
hotel
or
restaurant
in
the
south
would
serve
the
black
and
white
members
of
the
commission
together
and
finally
when
they
reached
an
impasse
in
father
ted
flew
them
all
to
dame
retreat
in
land
where
they
eventually
where
they
eventually
overcame
their
differences
and
hammered
out
final
deal
and
years
later
president
asked
father
ted
how
on
earth
he
was
able
to
broker
an
agreement
between
men
of
such
different
backgrounds
and
beliefs
and
father
ted
simply
said
that
during
their
first
dinner
in
they
discovered
they
were
all
fishermen
and
so
he
quickly
readied
boat
for
twilight
trip
out
on
the
lake
they
fished
and
they
talked
and
they
changed
the
course
of
history
will
not
pretend
that
the
challenges
we
face
will
be
easy
or
that
the
answers
will
come
quickly
or
that
all
our
differences
and
divisions
will
fade
happily
away
because
life
is
not
that
simple
it
never
has
been
but
as
you
leave
here
today
remember
the
lessons
of
cardinal
of
father
of
movements
for
change
both
large
and
small
remember
that
each
of
us
endowed
with
the
dignity
possessed
by
all
children
of
god
has
the
grace
to
ourselves
in
one
another
to
understand
that
we
all
seek
the
same
love
of
family
the
same
of
life
well
lived
remember
that
in
the
end
in
some
way
we
are
all
fishermen
if
nothing
else
that
knowledge
should
give
us
faith
that
through
our
collective
and
god
providence
and
our
willingness
to
shoulder
each
other
burdens
america
will
continue
on
its
precious
journey
towards
that
more
perfect
union
congratulations
class
of
may
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america

divided

so
long

do
wonderful
things

one
another

the
last
time

not
qualify
for
bailout
rush

not
count

troubled
asset

very
busy

on
his
memoirs

major
economic
recovery
package

forged
new
path

begun
to
change
the
culture
in
washington
we
even
made
the
white
house
place
where
people
can
learn
and
can
grow
just
recently
summers
asked
if
he
could
chair
the
white
house
council
on
women
and
girls
and
do
appreciate
that
is
here
tonight
because
it
is
seven
hours
past
his
bedtime
liked
that
one
in
the
last
hundred
days
we
also
grown
the
democratic
party
by
infusing
it
with
new
energy
and
bringing
in
fresh
young
faces
like
now
rightly
deserves
lot
of
credit
for
convincing
to
make
the
switch
but
secretary
actually
had
lot
to
do
with
it
too
one
day
she
just
pulled
him
aside
and
she
said
you
know
what
always
say
if
you
beat
them
join
them
which
brings
me
to
another
thing
that
changed
in
this
new
warmer
fuzzier
white
house
and
that
my
relationship
with
you
know
we
had
been
rivals
during
the
campaign
but
these
days
we
could
not
be
closer
in
fact
the
second
she
got
back
from
mexico
she
pulled
into
hug
and
gave
me
big
kiss
told
me
better
get
down
there
myself
which
really
appreciated
mean
it
was
it
was
nice
and
of
course
we
also
begun
to
change
america
image
in
the
world
we
talked
about
this
during
this
campaign
and
we
starting
to
execute
we
renewed
alliances
with
important
partners
and
friends
if
you
look
on
the
screen
there
there
am
with
prime
minister
there
am
with
brown
but
as
said
during
the
campaign
we
just
talk
to
our
friends
as
hard
as
it
is
we
also
have
to
talk
to
our
enemies
and
begun
to
do
exactly
that
take
look
at
the
monitor
there
now
let
me
be
clear
just
because
he
handed
me
copy
of
peter
pan
does
not
mean
that
going
to
read
it
but
it
good
diplomatic
practice
to
just
accept
these
gifts
all
this
change
has
been
easy
change
never
is
so
cut
the
tension
by
bringing
new
friend
to
the
white
house
he
warm
he
cuddly
loyal
enthusiastic
you
just
have
to
keep
him
on
tight
leash
every
once
in
while
he
goes
charging
off
in
the
wrong
direction
and
gets
himself
into
trouble
but
enough
about
all
in
all
we
proud
of
the
change
we
brought
to
washington
in
these
first
hundred
days
but
we
got
lot
of
work
left
to
do
as
all
of
you
know
so
like
to
talk
little
bit
about
what
my
administration
plans
to
achieve
in
the
next
hundred
days
during
the
second
hundred
days
we
will
design
build
and
open
library
dedicated
to
my
first
hundred
days
it
going
to
be
big
folks
in
the
next
hundred
days
will
learn
to
go
off
the
prompter
and
will
learn
to
stay
on
the
prompter
in
the
next
hundred
days
our
bipartisan
outreach
will
be
so
successful
that
even
john
will
consider
becoming
democrat
after
all
we
have
lot
in
common
he
is
person
of
although
not
that
appears
in
the
natural
world
what
up
john
in
the
next
hundred
days
will
meet
with
leader
who
rules
over
millions
with
an
iron
fist
who
owns
the
airwaves
and
uses
his
power
to
crush
all
who
would
challenge
his
authority
at
the
ballot
box
it
good
to
see
you
mayor
in
the
next
hundred
days
we
will
our
dog
because
the
last
thing
needs
is
someone
else
treating
him
like
fire
hydrant
in
the
next
hundred
days
will
strongly
consider
losing
my
cool
finally
believe
that
my
next
hundred
days
will
be
so
successful
will
be
able
to
complete
them
in
days
and
on
the
day
will
rest
just
want
to
end
by
saying
few
words
about
the
men
and
women
in
this
room
whose
job
it
is
to
inform
the
public
and
pursue
the
truth
you
know
we
meet
tonight
at
moment
of
extraordinary
challenge
for
this
nation
and
for
the
world
but
it
also
time
of
real
hardship
for
the
field
of
journalism
and
like
so
many
other
businesses
in
this
global
age
you
seen
sweeping
changes
and
technology
and
communications
that
lead
to
sense
of
uncertainty
and
anxiety
about
what
the
future
will
hold
across
the
country
there
are
extraordinary
hardworking
journalists
who
have
lost
their
jobs
in
recent
days
recent
weeks
recent
months
and
know
that
each
newspaper
and
media
outlet
is
wrestling
with
how
to
respond
to
these
changes
and
some
are
struggling
simply
to
stay
open
and
it
be
easy
not
every
ending
will
be
happy
one
but
it
also
true
that
your
ultimate
success
as
an
industry
is
essential
to
the
success
of
our
democracy
it
what
makes
this
thing
work
you
know
thomas
once
said
that
if
he
had
the
choice
between
government
without
newspapers
or
newspapers
without
government
he
would
not
hesitate
to
choose
the
latter
clearly
thomas
never
had
cable
news
to
contend
with
but
his
central
point
remains
government
without
newspapers
government
without
tough
and
vibrant
media
of
all
sorts
is
not
an
option
for
the
united
states
of
america
so
may
not
may
not
agree
with
everything
you
write
or
report
may
even
complain
or
more
likely
will
complain
from
time
to
time
about
how
you
do
your
jobs
but
do
so
with
the
knowledge
that
when
you
are
at
your
best
then
you
help
me
be
at
my
best
you
help
all
of
us
who
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
american
people
do
our
jobs
better
by
holding
us
accountable
by
demanding
honesty
by
preventing
us
from
taking
shortcuts
and
falling
into
easy
political
games
that
people
are
so
desperately
weary
of
and
that
kind
of
reporting
is
worth
preserving
not
just
for
your
sake
but
for
the
public
we
count
on
you
to
help
us
make
sense
of
complex
world
and
tell
the
stories
of
our
lives
the
way
they
happen
and
we
look
for
you
for
truth
even
if
it
always
an
approximation
even
if
this
is
season
of
renewal
and
reinvention
that
is
what
government
must
learn
to
do
that
what
businesses
must
learn
to
do
and
that
what
journalism
is
in
the
process
of
doing
and
when
look
out
at
this
room
and
think
about
the
dedicated
men
and
women
whose
questions
answered
over
the
last
few
years
know
that
for
all
the
challenges
this
industry
faces
it
not
short
on
talent
or
creativity
or
passion
or
commitment
it
not
short
of
young
people
who
are
eager
to
break
news
or
the
who
still
manage
to
ask
the
tough
ones
time
and
time
again
these
qualities
alone
will
not
solve
all
your
problems
but
they
certainly
prove
that
the
problems
are
worth
solving
and
that
is
good
place
as
any
to
begin
so
offer
you
my
thanks
offer
you
my
support
and
look
forward
to
working
with
you
and
answering
to
you
and
the
american
people
as
we
seek
more
perfect
union
in
the
months
and
years
ahead
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
to
for
the
wonderful
introduction
and
the
outstanding
work
she
doing
to
thank
you
for
your
wisdom
and
your
witness
speaker
senator
members
of
congress
our
good
friend
the
ambassador
of
israel
members
of
the
united
states
holocaust
memorial
council
and
most
importantly
the
survivors
and
rescuers
and
their
families
who
are
here
today
it
is
great
for
me
to
be
here
and
grateful
that
have
the
opportunity
to
address
you
briefly
we
gather
today
to
mourn
the
loss
of
so
many
lives
and
celebrate
those
who
saved
them
those
who
survived
and
contemplate
the
obligations
of
the
living
it
is
the
grimmest
of
ironies
that
one
of
the
most
savage
barbaric
acts
of
evil
in
history
began
in
one
of
the
most
societies
of
its
time
where
so
many
markers
of
human
progress
became
tools
of
human
depravity
science
that
can
heal
used
to
kill
education
that
can
enlighten
used
to
away
basic
moral
impulses
the
bureaucracy
that
sustains
modern
life
used
as
the
machinery
of
mass
death
ruthless
chillingly
efficient
system
where
many
were
responsible
for
the
killing
but
few
got
actual
blood
on
their
hands
while
the
uniqueness
of
the
holocaust
in
scope
and
in
method
is
truly
astounding
the
holocaust
was
driven
by
many
of
the
same
forces
that
have
atrocities
throughout
history
the
that
leads
to
hatred
and
blinds
us
to
our
common
humanity
the
justifications
that
replace
conscience
and
allow
cruelty
to
spread
the
willingness
of
those
who
are
neither
perpetrators
nor
victims
to
accept
the
assigned
role
of
bystander
believing
the
lie
that
good
people
are
ever
powerless
or
alone
the
fiction
that
we
do
not
have
choice
but
while
we
are
here
today
to
bear
witness
to
the
human
capacity
to
destroy
we
are
also
here
to
pay
tribute
to
the
human
impulse
to
save
in
the
moral
accounting
of
the
holocaust
as
we
reckon
with
numbers
like
million
as
we
recall
the
horror
of
numbers
etched
into
arms
we
also
factor
in
numbers
like
these
the
number
of
danish
jews
ferried
to
safety
many
of
whom
later
returned
home
to
find
the
who
rescued
them
had
also
faithfully
tended
their
homes
and
businesses
and
belongings
while
they
were
gone
we
remember
the
number
five
the
five
righteous
men
and
women
who
join
us
today
from
poland
we
are
awed
by
your
acts
of
courage
and
conscience
and
your
presence
today
compels
each
of
us
to
ask
ourselves
whether
we
would
have
done
what
you
did
we
can
only
hope
that
the
answer
is
yes
we
also
remember
the
number
the
number
of
jews
rescued
by
the
villagers
of
france
one
life
saved
for
each
of
its
residents
not
single
jew
who
came
there
was
turned
away
or
turned
in
but
it
was
not
until
decades
later
that
the
villagers
spoke
of
what
they
had
done
and
even
then
only
reluctantly
the
author
of
book
on
the
rescue
found
that
those
he
interviewed
were
baffled
by
his
interest
how
could
you
call
us
they
said
we
were
doing
what
had
to
be
done
that
is
the
question
of
the
righteous
those
who
would
do
extraordinary
good
at
extraordinary
risk
not
for
affirmation
or
acclaim
or
to
advance
their
own
interests
but
because
it
is
what
must
be
done
they
remind
us
that
no
one
is
born
or
murderer
these
are
choices
we
each
have
the
power
to
make
they
teach
us
that
no
one
can
make
us
into
bystanders
without
our
consent
and
that
we
are
never
truly
alone
that
if
we
have
the
courage
to
heed
that
still
small
voice
within
us
we
can
form
for
righteousness
that
can
span
village
even
nation
their
legacy
is
our
inheritance
and
the
question
is
how
do
we
and
preserve
it
how
do
we
ensure
that
never
again
is
an
empty
slogan
or
merely
an
aspiration
but
also
call
to
action
believe
we
start
by
doing
what
we
are
doing
today
by
bearing
witness
by
fighting
the
silence
that
is
evil
greatest
in
the
face
of
horrors
that
defy
comprehension
the
impulse
to
silence
is
understandable
my
own
great
uncle
returned
from
his
service
in
world
war
in
state
of
shock
saying
little
alone
with
painful
memories
that
would
not
leave
his
head
he
went
up
into
the
attic
according
to
the
stories
that
heard
and
would
come
down
for
six
months
he
was
one
of
the
liberators
someone
who
at
very
tender
age
had
seen
the
unimaginable
and
so
some
of
the
liberators
who
are
here
today
us
with
their
presence
all
of
whom
we
for
their
extraordinary
service
my
great
uncle
was
part
of
the
infantry
division
the
first
americans
to
reach
nazi
concentration
camp
and
they
liberated
part
of
where
tens
of
thousands
had
perished
the
story
goes
that
when
the
americans
marched
in
they
discovered
the
starving
survivors
and
the
piles
of
dead
bodies
and
general
made
decision
he
ordered
germans
from
the
nearby
town
to
tour
the
camp
so
they
could
see
what
had
been
done
in
their
name
and
he
ordered
american
troops
to
tour
the
camp
so
they
could
see
the
evil
they
were
fighting
against
then
he
invited
congressmen
and
journalists
to
bear
witness
and
he
ordered
that
photographs
and
films
be
made
some
of
us
have
seen
those
same
images
whether
in
the
holocaust
museum
or
when
visited
and
they
never
leave
you
said
that
he
wanted
to
be
in
position
to
give
firsthand
evidence
of
these
things
if
ever
in
the
future
there
develops
tendency
to
charge
these
allegations
merely
to
propaganda
understood
the
danger
of
silence
he
understood
that
if
no
one
knew
what
had
happened
that
would
be
yet
another
atrocity
and
it
would
be
the
perpetrators
ultimate
triumph
what
did
to
record
these
crimes
for
history
is
what
we
are
doing
here
today
that
what
and
the
survivors
we
here
do
by
fighting
to
make
their
memories
part
of
our
collective
memory
that
what
the
holocaust
museum
does
every
day
on
our
national
mall
the
place
where
we
display
for
the
world
our
triumphs
and
failures
and
the
lessons
we
learned
from
our
history
it
the
very
opposite
of
silence
but
we
must
also
remember
that
bearing
witness
is
not
the
end
of
our
obligation
it
just
the
beginning
we
know
that
evil
has
yet
to
run
its
course
on
earth
we
seen
it
in
this
century
in
the
mass
graves
and
the
ashes
of
villages
burned
to
the
ground
and
children
used
as
soldiers
and
rape
used
as
weapon
of
war
to
this
day
there
are
those
who
insist
the
holocaust
never
happened
who
perpetrate
every
form
of
intolerance
racism
and
homophobia
xenophobia
sexism
and
more
hatred
that
degrades
its
victim
and
diminishes
us
all
today
and
every
day
we
have
an
opportunity
as
well
as
an
obligation
to
confront
these
scourges
to
fight
the
impulse
to
turn
the
channel
when
we
see
images
that
disturb
us
or
wrap
ourselves
in
the
false
comfort
that
others
sufferings
are
not
our
own
instead
we
have
the
opportunity
to
make
habit
of
empathy
to
ourselves
in
each
other
to
commit
ourselves
to
resisting
injustice
and
intolerance
and
indifference
in
whatever
forms
they
may
take
whether
confronting
those
who
tell
lies
about
history
or
doing
everything
we
can
to
prevent
and
end
atrocities
like
those
that
took
place
in
rwanda
those
taking
place
in
that
is
my
commitment
as
president
hope
that
is
yours
as
well
it
will
not
be
easy
at
times
fulfilling
these
obligations
require
but
in
the
final
analysis
believe
history
gives
us
cause
for
hope
rather
than
despair
the
hope
of
chosen
people
who
have
overcome
oppression
since
the
days
of
exodus
of
the
nation
of
israel
rising
from
the
destruction
of
the
holocaust
of
the
strong
and
enduring
bonds
between
our
nations
it
is
the
hope
too
of
those
who
not
only
survived
but
chose
to
live
teaching
us
the
meaning
of
courage
and
resilience
and
dignity
thinking
today
of
study
conducted
after
the
war
that
found
that
holocaust
survivors
living
in
america
actually
had
higher
birthrate
than
american
jews
what
stunning
act
of
faith
to
bring
child
in
world
that
has
shown
you
so
much
cruelty
to
believe
that
no
matter
what
you
have
endured
or
how
much
you
have
lost
in
the
end
you
have
duty
to
life
we
find
cause
for
hope
as
well
in
protestant
and
catholic
children
attending
school
together
in
northern
ireland
in
and
living
side
by
side
forgiving
who
have
done
the
unforgivable
in
movement
to
save
that
has
thousands
of
high
school
and
college
chapters
in
countries
and
brought
people
to
the
washington
mall
people
of
every
age
and
faith
and
background
and
race
united
in
common
cause
with
suffering
brothers
and
sisters
halfway
around
the
world
those
numbers
can
be
our
future
our
fellow
citizens
of
the
world
showing
us
how
to
make
the
journey
from
oppression
to
survival
from
witness
to
resistance
and
ultimately
to
reconciliation
that
is
what
we
mean
when
we
say
never
again
so
today
during
this
season
when
we
celebrate
liberation
resurrection
and
the
possibility
of
redemption
may
each
of
us
renew
our
resolve
to
do
what
must
be
done
and
may
we
strive
each
day
both
individually
and
as
nation
to
be
among
the
righteous

with
all
of
you
we
going
to
talk
about
the
economy
today
and
was
telling
president
this
may
be
slightly
longer
than
usually
give
but
it
slightly
bigger
topic
and
that
is
how
we
are
going
to
deal
with
so
many
of
our
economic
challenges
you
know
it
been
weeks
now
since
my
administration
began
and
think
that
even
our
critics
would
agree
that
at
the
very
least
we
been
busy
in
just
under
three
months
we
responded
to
an
extraordinary
set
of
economic
challenges
with
extraordinary
action
action
that
been
unprecedented
both
in
terms
of
its
scale
and
its
speed
and
know
that
some
have
accused
us
of
taking
on
too
much
at
once
others
believe
we
have
done
enough
and
many
americans
are
simply
wondering
how
all
of
our
different
programs
and
policies
fit
together
in
single
strategy
that
will
move
this
economy
from
recession
to
recovery
and
ultimately
to
prosperity
so
today
want
to
step
back
for
moment
and
explain
our
strategy
as
clearly
as
can
this
is
going
to
be
prose
and
not
poetry
want
to
talk
about
what
we
done
why
we
done
it
and
what
we
have
left
to
do
want
to
update
you
on
the
progress
we
made
but
also
want
to
be
honest
about
the
pitfalls
that
may
still
lie
ahead
most
of
all
want
every
american
to
know
that
each
action
we
take
and
each
policy
we
pursue
is
driven
by
larger
vision
of
america
future
future
where
sustained
economic
growth
creates
good
jobs
and
rising
incomes
future
where
prosperity
is
not
by
excessive
debt
or
reckless
speculation
or
fleeting
profits
but
is
instead
built
by
skilled
productive
workers
by
sound
investments
that
will
spread
opportunity
at
home
and
allow
this
nation
to
lead
the
world
in
the
technologies
and
the
innovation
and
discoveries
that
will
shape
the
century
that
the
america
see
that
the
america
that
is
preparing
so
many
of
you
for
that
is
the
future
that
know
that
we
can
have
now
to
understand
how
we
get
there
we
first
need
to
understand
how
we
got
here
recessions
are
not
uncommon
markets
and
economies
naturally
ebb
and
flow
as
we
seen
many
times
in
our
history
but
this
recession
is
different
this
recession
was
not
caused
by
normal
downturn
in
the
business
cycle
it
was
caused
by
perfect
storm
of
irresponsibility
and
poor
that
stretched
from
wall
street
to
washington
to
main
street
as
has
been
widely
reported
it
started
in
the
housing
market
during
the
course
of
the
decade
the
formula
for
buying
house
changed
instead
of
saving
their
pennies
to
buy
their
dream
house
many
americans
found
that
suddenly
they
could
take
out
loans
that
by
traditional
standards
their
incomes
just
could
not
support
others
were
tricked
into
signing
these
loans
by
lenders
who
were
trying
to
make
quick
profit
the
reason
these
loans
were
so
readily
available
was
that
wall
street
saw
big
profits
to
be
made
investment
banks
would
buy
and
package
together
these
questionable
mortgages
into
securities
arguing
that
by
pooling
the
mortgages
the
risks
had
somehow
been
reduced
and
credit
agencies
that
are
supposed
to
help
investors
determine
the
soundness
of
various
investments
stamped
the
securities
with
their
safest
rating
when
they
should
have
been
buyer
beware
no
one
really
knew
what
the
actual
value
of
these
securities
were
no
one
fully
understood
what
the
risks
were
but
since
the
housing
market
was
booming
and
prices
were
rising
banks
and
investors
just
kept
buying
and
selling
them
always
passing
off
the
risk
to
someone
else
for
greater
profit
without
having
to
take
any
of
the
ultimate
responsibility
banks
took
on
more
debt
than
they
could
handle
the
companies
and
mac
whose
traditional
mandate
was
to
help
support
traditional
mortgages
decided
to
get
in
on
the
action
by
buying
and
holding
billions
of
dollars
of
these
securities
the
biggest
insurer
in
the
world
that
had
very
traditional
insurance
business
that
was
very
profitable
decided
to
make
profits
suddenly
by
selling
billions
of
dollars
of
complicated
financial
instruments
that
supposedly
insured
these
securities
everybody
was
making
record
profits
except
the
wealth
created
was
real
only
on
paper
and
as
the
bubble
grew
there
was
almost
no
accountability
or
oversight
from
anyone
in
washington
then
the
housing
bubble
burst
home
prices
fell
people
began
to
default
on
their
mortgages
and
the
value
of
all
those
loans
and
securities
plummeted
banks
and
investors
could
find
anyone
to
buy
them
greed
gave
way
to
fear
investors
pulled
their
money
out
of
the
market
large
financial
institutions
that
did
have
enough
money
on
hand
to
pay
off
all
their
obligations
collapsed
other
banks
held
on
tight
to
their
money
and
simply
stopped
lending
now
this
is
when
the
crisis
spread
from
wall
street
to
main
street
after
all
the
ability
to
get
loan
is
how
you
finance
the
purchase
of
everything
from
home
to
car
to
as
you
all
know
very
well
college
education
it
how
stores
stock
their
shelves
and
farms
buy
equipment
and
businesses
make
payroll
so
when
banks
stopped
lending
money
businesses
started
laying
off
workers
when
workers
had
less
money
to
spend
businesses
were
forced
to
lay
off
even
more
workers
when
people
could
get
car
loan
bad
situation
at
the
auto
companies
became
even
worse
when
people
could
get
home
loans
the
crisis
in
the
housing
market
only
deepened
because
the
infected
securities
were
being
traded
worldwide
and
other
nations
also
had
weak
regulations
this
recession
soon
became
global
and
when
other
nations
afford
to
buy
our
goods
it
slows
our
economy
even
further
so
this
is
the
situation
the
downward
spiral
that
we
confronted
on
the
day
that
we
took
office
so
our
most
urgent
task
has
been
to
clear
away
the
wreckage
repair
the
immediate
damage
to
the
economy
and
do
everything
we
can
to
prevent
larger
collapse
and
since
the
problems
we
face
are
all
working
off
each
other
to
feed
vicious
economic
downturn
we
had
no
choice
but
to
attack
all
fronts
of
our
economic
crisis
simultaneously
the
first
step
was
to
fight
severe
shortage
of
demand
in
the
economy
so
the
federal
reserve
did
this
by
dramatically
lowering
interest
rates
last
year
in
order
to
boost
investment
my
administration
and
congress
boosted
demand
by
passing
the
largest
recovery
plan
in
our
nation
history
it
plan
that
already
in
the
process
of
saving
or
creating
million
jobs
over
the
next
two
years
it
putting
money
directly
into
people
pockets
with
tax
cut
for
percent
of
working
families
that
now
showing
up
in
across
america
and
to
cushion
the
blow
of
this
recession
we
also
provided
extended
unemployment
benefits
and
continued
health
care
coverage
to
americans
who
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own
now
you
will
recall
that
some
argued
this
recovery
plan
is
case
of
irresponsible
government
spending
that
it
somehow
to
blame
for
our
deficit
projections
and
that
the
federal
government
should
be
cutting
instead
of
increasing
spending
right
now
so
want
to
tackle
this
argument
head
on
to
begin
with
economists
on
both
the
left
and
the
right
agree
that
the
last
thing
government
should
do
in
the
middle
of
recession
is
to
cut
back
on
spending
you
see
when
this
recession
began
many
families
sat
around
the
kitchen
table
and
tried
to
figure
out
where
they
could
cut
back
and
so
have
many
businesses
and
this
is
completely
reasonable
and
understandable
reaction
but
if
everybody
if
everybody
if
every
family
in
america
if
every
business
in
america
cuts
back
all
at
once
then
no
one
is
spending
any
money
which
means
there
are
no
customers
which
means
there
are
more
layoffs
which
means
the
economy
gets
even
worse
that
why
the
government
has
to
step
in
and
temporarily
boost
spending
in
order
to
stimulate
demand
that
exactly
what
we
doing
right
now
second
absolutely
agree
that
our
deficit
is
major
problem
that
we
have
to
fix
but
the
fact
is
that
this
recovery
plan
represents
only
tiny
fraction
of
that
deficit
as
discuss
in
moment
the
key
to
dealing
with
our
deficit
and
our
national
debt
is
to
get
handle
on
health
care
costs
not
to
stand
idly
by
as
the
economy
goes
into
free
fall
so
the
recovery
plan
has
been
the
first
step
in
confronting
this
economic
crisis
the
second
step
has
been
to
heal
our
financial
system
so
that
credit
is
once
again
flowing
to
the
businesses
and
families
who
rely
on
it
the
heart
of
this
financial
crisis
is
that
too
many
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
simply
stopped
lending
money
in
climate
of
fear
banks
were
unable
to
replace
their
losses
from
some
of
those
bad
mortgages
by
raising
new
capital
on
their
own
and
they
were
unwilling
to
lend
the
money
they
did
have
because
they
were
afraid
that
no
one
would
pay
it
back
it
for
this
reason
that
the
last
administration
used
what
they
called
the
troubled
asset
relief
program
or
to
provide
these
banks
with
temporary
financial
assistance
in
order
to
get
them
lending
again
now
understand
that
is
not
popular
and
have
to
say
that
do
agree
with
some
of
the
ways
the
program
was
managed
but
do
agree
with
the
broader
rationale
that
we
must
provide
banks
with
the
capital
and
the
confidence
necessary
to
start
lending
again
that
the
purpose
of
the
stress
tests
that
will
soon
tell
us
how
much
additional
capital
will
be
needed
to
support
lending
at
our
largest
banks
ideally
these
needs
will
be
met
by
private
investors
who
are
willing
to
put
in
money
to
these
banks
but
where
that
not
possible
and
banks
require
substantial
additional
resources
from
the
government
then
we
will
hold
accountable
those
who
are
responsible
we
force
the
necessary
adjustments
we
provide
the
support
to
clean
up
those
bank
balance
sheets
and
we
will
assure
the
continuity
of
strong
and
viable
institution
that
can
serve
our
people
and
our
economy
of
course
there
are
some
who
differ
with
our
approach
on
the
one
hand
there
are
some
who
argue
that
the
government
should
stand
back
and
simply
let
these
banks
fail
especially
since
in
many
cases
it
was
their
bad
decisions
that
helped
create
the
crisis
in
the
first
place
but
whether
we
like
it
or
not
history
has
shown
repeatedly
that
when
nations
do
not
take
early
and
aggressive
action
to
get
credit
flowing
again
they
have
crises
that
last
years
and
years
instead
of
months
and
months
years
of
low
growth
years
of
low
job
creation
years
of
low
investment
all
of
which
cost
these
nations
far
more
than
course
of
bold
upfront
action
and
although
there
are
lot
of
americans
who
understandably
think
that
government
money
would
be
better
spent
going
directly
to
families
and
businesses
instead
of
to
banks
one
of
my
most
frequent
questions
in
the
letters
that
get
from
constituents
is
where
my
bailout
and
understand
the
sentiment
it
makes
sense
intuitively
and
morally
it
makes
sense
but
the
truth
is
that
dollar
of
capital
in
bank
can
actually
result
in
or
of
loans
to
families
and
businesses
so
that
multiplier
effect
that
can
ultimately
lead
to
faster
pace
of
economic
growth
that
why
we
have
to
fix
the
banks
now
on
the
other
hand
there
have
been
some
who
do
dispute
that
we
need
to
shore
up
the
banking
system
but
they
suggest
that
we
been
too
timid
in
how
we
go
about
it
this
is
essentially
the
argument
that
some
of
you
may
have
heard
and
the
argument
says
that
the
federal
government
should
have
already
stepped
in
and
taken
over
major
financial
institutions
the
way
that
the
currently
intervenes
in
smaller
banks
and
that
our
failure
my
administration
failure
to
do
so
is
yet
another
example
of
washington
coddling
wall
street
why
are
you
tougher
on
the
banks
so
let
me
be
clear
the
reason
we
have
not
taken
this
step
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
ideological
or
political
judgment
we
made
about
government
involvement
in
banks
it
certainly
not
because
of
any
concern
we
have
for
the
management
and
shareholders
whose
actions
helped
to
cause
this
mess
rather
it
because
we
believe
that
government
takeovers
are
likely
to
end
up
costing
taxpayers
even
more
in
the
end
and
because
it
more
likely
to
undermine
than
create
confidence
governments
should
practice
the
same
principle
as
doctors
first
do
no
harm
so
rest
assured
we
will
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
get
credit
flowing
again
but
we
will
do
so
in
ways
that
risks
to
taxpayers
and
to
the
broader
economy
to
that
end
in
addition
to
the
program
to
provide
capital
to
the
banks
we
launched
plan
that
will
pair
government
resources
with
private
investment
in
order
to
clear
away
the
old
loans
and
securities
the
toxic
assets
that
are
also
preventing
our
banks
from
lending
money
now
what
we
also
learned
during
this
crisis
is
that
our
banks
are
the
only
institutions
affected
by
these
toxic
assets
that
are
clogging
the
financial
system
for
example
is
not
bank
it
an
insurance
company
as
mentioned
and
yet
because
it
chose
to
insure
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
risky
assets
essentially
creating
hedge
fund
on
top
of
an
insurance
company
its
failure
could
threaten
the
entire
financial
system
and
freeze
lending
even
more
and
that
why
as
frustrating
as
it
is
and
promise
you
nobody
is
more
frustrated
than
me
with
promise
we
had
to
provide
support
for
because
the
entire
system
as
fragile
as
it
is
could
be
profoundly
endangered
if
went
into
liquidation
bankruptcy
it
also
why
we
need
new
legal
authority
so
that
we
have
the
power
to
intervene
in
such
financial
institutions
the
same
way
that
bankruptcy
courts
currently
do
with
businesses
that
hit
hard
times
but
do
pose
systemic
risks
and
that
way
we
can
restructure
these
businesses
in
an
orderly
way
that
does
induce
panic
in
the
financial
system
and
by
the
way
will
allow
us
to
restructure
inappropriate
bonus
contracts
without
creating
perception
the
government
can
just
change
compensation
rules
on
whim
this
is
also
why
we
moving
aggressively
to
unfreeze
markets
and
jumpstart
lending
outside
the
banking
system
where
more
than
half
of
all
lending
in
america
actually
takes
place
to
do
this
we
started
program
that
will
increase
guarantees
for
small
business
loans
and
unlock
the
market
for
auto
loans
and
student
loans
and
to
the
housing
market
we
launched
plan
that
will
save
up
to
four
million
responsible
homeowners
from
foreclosure
and
help
many
millions
more
to
refinance
their
homes
in
few
weeks
we
will
also
reassess
the
state
of
and
general
motors
two
companies
with
an
important
place
in
our
history
and
large
footprint
in
our
economy
but
two
companies
that
have
also
fallen
on
hard
times
late
last
year
the
companies
were
given
transitional
loans
by
the
previous
administration
to
tide
them
over
as
they
worked
to
develop
viable
business
plans
unfortunately
the
plans
they
developed
fell
short
so
we
given
them
some
additional
time
to
work
these
complex
issues
through
and
by
the
way
we
owed
that
not
to
the
executives
whose
bad
bets
contributed
to
the
weakening
of
their
companies
but
to
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
workers
whose
livelihoods
hang
in
the
balance
entire
towns
entire
communities
entire
states
are
profoundly
impacted
by
what
happens
in
the
auto
industry
now
it
is
our
fervent
hope
that
in
the
coming
weeks
will
find
viable
partner
and
will
develop
business
plan
that
will
put
it
on
path
to
profitability
without
endless
support
from
american
taxpayer
in
the
meantime
we
taking
steps
to
spur
demand
for
american
cars
and
provide
relief
for
and
their
communities
and
we
will
continue
to
reaffirm
this
nation
commitment
to
american
auto
industry
that
creates
new
jobs
and
builds
the
cars
and
trucks
that
will
carry
us
toward
future
finally
to
coordinate
global
response
to
this
global
recession
went
to
the
meeting
of
the
nations
in
london
the
other
week
each
nation
has
undertaken
significant
stimulus
to
spur
demand
all
agreed
to
pursue
tougher
regulatory
reforms
we
also
agreed
to
triple
the
lending
capacity
of
the
international
monetary
fund
which
as
many
of
you
know
is
an
international
financial
institution
supported
by
all
the
major
economies
so
that
they
can
provide
direct
assistance
to
developing
nations
and
vulnerable
populations
that
not
just
charity
because
america
success
depends
on
whether
other
nations
have
the
ability
to
buy
what
we
sell
it
important
that
we
pay
attention
to
these
emerging
markets
we
pledged
to
avoid
the
trade
barriers
and
protectionism
that
hurts
us
all
in
the
end
and
we
decided
to
meet
again
in
the
fall
to
gauge
our
progress
and
take
additional
steps
if
necessary
so
that
where
we
been
that
what
we
done
in
the
last
three
months
all
of
these
actions
the
recovery
act
the
bank
program
the
housing
plan
the
strengthening
of
the
credit
market
the
auto
plan
and
our
work
at
the
all
have
been
necessary
pieces
of
the
recovery
puzzle
they
been
designed
to
increase
aggregate
demand
to
get
credit
flowing
again
to
families
and
businesses
and
to
help
families
and
businesses
ride
out
the
storm
and
taken
together
these
actions
are
starting
to
generate
signs
of
economic
progress
because
of
our
recovery
plan
schools
and
police
departments
have
cancelled
planned
layoffs
clean
energy
companies
and
construction
companies
are
workers
to
build
everything
from
windows
to
new
roads
and
highways
our
housing
plan
has
helped
lead
to
spike
in
the
number
of
homeowners
who
are
taking
advantage
of
mortgage
rates
by
refinancing
which
is
like
putting
tax
cut
in
your
pocket
our
program
to
support
the
market
for
auto
loans
and
student
loans
has
started
to
unfreeze
this
market
and
more
of
this
lending
in
the
last
few
weeks
and
small
businesses
are
seeing
jump
in
loan
activity
for
the
first
time
in
months
now
this
is
all
welcome
and
encouraging
news
it
does
not
mean
the
hard
times
are
over
will
continue
to
be
difficult
year
for
america
economy
and
obviously
most
difficult
for
those
who
lost
their
jobs
the
severity
of
this
recession
will
cause
more
job
loss
more
and
more
pain
before
it
ends
the
market
will
continue
to
rise
and
fall
credit
is
still
not
flowing
nearly
as
easily
as
it
should
the
process
for
restructuring
and
the
auto
companies
will
involve
difficult
and
sometimes
unpopular
choices
we
are
not
finished
yet
on
that
front
and
all
of
this
means
that
there
much
more
work
to
be
done
but
all
of
this
also
means
that
you
can
continue
to
expect
an
unrelenting
unyielding
effort
from
this
administration
to
fight
for
economic
recovery
on
all
fronts
but
even
as
we
continue
to
clear
away
the
wreckage
and
address
the
immediate
crisis
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
our
next
task
beginning
now
is
to
make
sure
such
crisis
never
happens
again
even
as
we
clean
up
balance
sheets
and
get
credit
flowing
again
even
as
people
start
spending
and
businesses
start
hiring
all
that
going
to
happen
we
have
to
that
we
can
not
go
back
to
the
economy
that
led
us
to
this
point
it
is
simply
not
sustainable
to
have
financial
system
that
is
governed
by
rules
and
regulations
that
allowed
the
recklessness
of
few
to
threaten
the
entire
economy
it
is
not
sustainable
to
have
an
economy
where
in
one
year
percent
of
our
corporate
profits
came
from
financial
sector
that
was
based
on
inflated
home
prices
credit
cards
banks
and
overvalued
assets
it
not
sustainable
to
have
an
economy
where
the
incomes
of
the
top
percent
has
while
the
typical
working
household
has
seen
their
incomes
decline
by
nearly
that
just
not
sustainable
model
for
prosperity
for
even
as
too
many
were
out
there
chasing
bonuses
and
profits
over
the
last
decade
we
continued
to
neglect
the
threats
to
our
prosperity
the
crushing
burden
that
the
rising
cost
of
health
care
is
placing
on
families
and
businesses
the
failure
of
our
education
system
to
prepare
our
workers
for
new
age
the
progress
that
other
nations
are
making
on
clean
energy
industries
and
technologies
while
we
we
remain
addicted
to
foreign
oil
the
growing
debt
that
we
passing
on
to
our
children
even
after
we
emerge
from
the
current
recession
these
challenges
will
still
represent
major
obstacles
that
stand
in
the
way
of
our
success
in
the
century
so
we
got
lot
of
work
to
do
now
there
parable
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
that
tells
the
story
of
two
men
the
first
built
his
house
on
pile
of
sand
and
it
was
soon
destroyed
when
storm
hit
but
the
second
is
known
as
the
wise
man
for
when
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
rock
it
was
founded
upon
rock
we
can
not
rebuild
this
economy
on
the
same
pile
of
sand
we
must
build
our
house
upon
rock
we
must
lay
new
foundation
for
growth
and
prosperity
foundation
that
will
move
us
from
an
era
of
borrow
and
spend
to
one
where
we
save
and
invest
where
we
consume
less
at
home
and
send
more
exports
abroad
it
foundation
built
upon
five
pillars
that
will
grow
our
economy
and
make
this
new
century
another
american
century
number
one
new
rules
for
wall
street
that
will
reward
drive
and
innovation
not
reckless
number
two
new
investments
in
education
that
will
make
our
workforce
more
skilled
and
competitive
number
three
new
investments
in
renewable
energy
and
technology
that
will
create
new
jobs
and
new
industries
number
four
new
investments
in
health
care
that
will
cut
costs
for
families
and
businesses
and
number
five
new
savings
in
our
federal
budget
that
will
bring
down
the
debt
for
future
generations
that
the
new
foundation
we
must
build
that
our
house
built
upon
rock
that
must
be
our
future
and
my
administration
policies
are
designed
to
achieve
that
future
let
me
talk
about
each
of
these
steps
in
turn
the
first
step
we
will
take
to
build
this
foundation
is
to
reform
the
outdated
rules
and
regulations
that
allowed
this
crisis
to
happen
in
the
first
place
it
is
time
to
lay
down
tough
new
rules
of
the
road
for
wall
street
to
ensure
that
we
never
find
ourselves
here
again
just
as
after
the
great
depression
new
rules
were
designed
for
banks
to
avoid
the
kind
of
reckless
speculation
that
helped
to
create
the
depression
so
we
got
to
make
adaptations
to
our
current
set
of
rules
create
rules
that
punish
shortcuts
and
abuse
rules
that
tie
someone
pay
to
their
actual
job
performance
novel
concept
rules
that
protect
typical
american
families
when
they
buy
home
get
credit
card
or
invest
in
so
we
already
begun
to
work
with
congress
to
shape
this
comprehensive
new
regulatory
framework
and
expect
bill
to
arrive
on
my
desk
for
my
signature
before
the
year
is
out
the
second
pillar
of
this
new
foundation
is
an
education
system
that
finally
prepares
our
workers
for
century
economy
you
know
in
the
century
the
bill
helped
send
generation
to
college
for
decades
we
led
the
world
in
educational
attainment
and
as
consequence
we
led
the
world
in
economic
growth
but
in
this
new
economy
we
come
to
trail
the
world
leaders
in
graduation
rates
in
educational
achievement
in
the
production
of
scientists
and
engineers
that
why
we
have
set
goal
that
will
greatly
enhance
our
ability
to
compete
for
the
jobs
of
the
century
by
america
will
once
again
have
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
that
is
the
goal
that
we
have
set
and
we
intend
to
do
to
meet
that
goal
we
have
to
start
early
so
we
already
dramatically
expanded
early
childhood
education
we
are
investing
in
innovative
programs
that
have
proven
to
help
schools
meet
high
standards
and
close
achievement
gaps
we
creating
new
rewards
that
tie
teachers
performance
and
new
pathways
for
advancement
and
asked
every
american
to
commit
to
at
least
one
year
or
more
of
higher
education
or
career
training
and
we
have
provided
tax
credits
to
make
college
education
more
affordable
for
every
american
even
those
who
attend
and
by
the
way
one
of
the
changes
that
would
like
to
see
and
going
to
be
talking
about
this
in
weeks
to
come
is
once
again
seeing
our
best
and
our
brightest
commit
themselves
to
making
things
engineers
scientists
innovators
for
so
long
we
have
placed
at
the
top
of
our
pinnacle
folks
who
can
manipulate
numbers
and
engage
in
complex
financial
calculations
and
that
good
we
need
some
of
that
but
you
know
what
we
can
really
use
is
some
more
scientists
and
some
more
engineers
who
are
building
and
making
things
that
we
can
export
to
other
countries
now
the
third
pillar
of
this
new
foundation
is
to
harness
the
renewable
energy
that
can
create
millions
of
new
jobs
and
new
industries
we
all
know
that
the
country
that
harnesses
this
new
energy
source
will
lead
the
century
yet
we
allowed
other
countries
to
outpace
us
on
this
race
to
the
future
do
know
about
you
but
do
not
accept
future
where
the
jobs
and
industries
of
tomorrow
take
root
beyond
our
borders
think
it
time
for
america
to
lead
again
so
the
investments
we
made
in
the
recovery
act
will
double
this
nation
supply
of
renewable
energy
in
the
next
three
years
and
we
are
putting
americans
to
work
making
our
homes
and
buildings
more
efficient
so
that
we
can
save
billions
on
our
energy
bills
and
grow
our
economy
at
the
same
time
now
the
only
though
that
we
can
truly
spark
the
transformation
that
need
is
through
gradual
cap
on
carbon
pollution
so
that
clean
energy
is
the
profitable
kind
of
energy
there
are
those
who
argued
that
we
should
attempt
we
should
even
be
thinking
we
should
even
be
talking
about
such
transition
until
the
economy
recovers
and
they
are
right
that
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
costs
of
transition
to
clean
energy
economy
will
not
be
easy
but
we
can
no
longer
delay
putting
framework
for
clean
energy
economy
in
place
that
needs
to
be
done
now
if
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
know
today
that
we
are
closing
this
carbon
pollution
loophole
they
start
investing
in
clean
energy
now
and
pretty
soon
we
see
more
companies
constructing
solar
panels
and
workers
building
wind
turbines
and
car
companies
manufacturing
cars
investors
will
put
some
money
into
new
energy
technology
and
small
business
will
open
to
start
selling
it
that
how
we
can
grow
this
economy
enhance
our
security
and
protect
our
planet
at
the
same
time
now
the
fourth
pillar
of
our
new
foundation
is
century
health
care
system
where
families
businesses
and
government
budgets
are
dragged
down
by
insurance
premiums
one
and
half
million
americans
could
lose
their
homes
this
year
just
because
of
medical
crisis
major
american
corporations
are
struggling
to
compete
with
their
foreign
counterparts
small
businesses
are
closing
their
doors
we
allow
the
cost
of
health
care
to
continue
strangling
our
economy
and
that
why
our
recovery
act
will
invest
in
electronic
health
records
with
strict
privacy
standards
that
can
save
money
and
lives
and
reduce
medical
error
that
why
we
made
the
largest
investment
ever
in
preventive
care
because
that
one
of
the
best
ways
to
keep
costs
under
control
and
included
in
the
budgets
that
just
passed
congress
is
an
historic
commitment
to
reform
that
will
finally
make
quality
health
care
affordable
for
every
american
so
looking
forward
in
the
next
few
months
to
working
with
both
parties
in
congress
to
make
this
reform
reality
we
can
get
this
done
and
we
have
to
get
it
done
now
fixing
our
health
care
system
will
will
require
resources
it
not
going
to
be
free
but
in
my
budget
we
made
commitment
to
fully
pay
for
reform
without
increasing
the
deficit
and
we
identified
specific
savings
that
will
make
the
health
care
system
more
efficient
and
reduce
costs
for
us
all
in
fact
we
undertaken
an
unprecedented
effort
to
find
this
kind
of
savings
in
every
corner
of
the
budget
because
the
final
pillar
in
building
our
new
foundation
is
restoring
fiscal
discipline
once
this
economy
recovers
already
we
identified
trillion
dollars
in
deficit
reductions
over
the
next
decade
we
need
to
do
more
but
we
already
done
that
we
announced
procurement
reform
that
will
greatly
reduce
contracts
and
save
the
government
billion
we
need
to
do
more
but
that
an
important
start
secretary
gates
recently
announced
courageous
set
of
reforms
that
go
right
at
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
waste
and
cost
overruns
that
have
bloated
our
budget
without
making
america
safer
we
need
to
do
more
but
that
proposal
by
secretary
gates
is
right
on
target
we
will
end
education
programs
that
do
work
we
will
root
out
waste
and
fraud
and
abuse
in
our
program
altogether
this
budget
will
reduce
discretionary
spending
for
domestic
programs
as
share
of
the
economy
by
more
than
percent
over
the
next
decade
to
the
lowest
level
we
seen
since
we
began
keeping
records
nearly
half
century
ago
and
as
we
continue
to
go
through
the
federal
budget
line
by
line
we
will
be
announcing
additional
savings
secured
by
eliminating
and
consolidating
programs
that
we
do
need
so
we
can
make
room
for
the
things
that
we
do
need
that
what
we
doing
now
of
course
that
for
some
this
is
enough
know
there
criticism
out
there
that
my
administration
has
been
spending
with
reckless
abandon
pushing
liberal
social
agenda
while
mortgaging
our
children
future
you
heard
the
argument
well
let
me
make
three
points
first
as
said
earlier
the
worst
thing
that
we
could
do
in
recession
this
severe
is
to
try
to
cut
government
spending
at
the
same
time
as
families
and
businesses
around
the
world
are
cutting
back
on
their
spending
so
as
serious
as
our
deficit
and
debt
problems
are
and
they
are
very
serious
major
efforts
to
deal
with
them
have
to
focus
on
the
medium
and
budget
picture
not
on
the
and
that
exactly
what
we
done
second
in
tackling
the
deficit
issue
we
simply
can
not
sacrifice
the
investments
that
we
so
desperately
need
to
generate
prosperity
that
the
argument
that
some
critics
have
made
well
you
proposing
health
care
reform
you
should
be
doing
that
you
proposing
education
investments
you
should
be
doing
that
that
adds
to
the
deficit
look
just
as
family
may
cut
back
on
all
kinds
of
luxuries
but
will
still
insist
on
spending
money
to
get
their
children
through
college
will
refuse
to
have
their
kids
drop
out
of
college
and
go
to
work
in
some
place
even
though
that
might
bring
in
some
income
in
the
because
they
thinking
about
the
long
term
so
we
as
country
have
to
make
current
choices
with
an
eye
for
the
future
if
we
do
invest
now
in
renewable
energy
if
we
do
invest
now
in
skilled
workforce
if
we
do
invest
now
in
more
affordable
health
care
system
this
economy
simply
grow
at
the
pace
it
needs
to
in
two
or
five
or
years
down
the
road
if
we
do
lay
this
new
foundation
now
it
be
long
before
we
right
back
where
we
are
today
and
can
assure
you
that
chronically
slow
growth
will
not
help
our
budget
situation
that
the
second
point
third
point
the
problem
with
our
deficit
and
debt
is
not
new
it
has
been
building
dramatically
over
the
past
eight
years
largely
because
big
tax
cuts
combined
with
increased
spending
on
two
wars
and
the
increased
costs
of
government
health
care
programs
have
pushed
it
ever
upwards
this
structural
gap
in
our
budget
between
the
amount
of
money
that
coming
in
and
the
amount
of
money
that
going
out
will
only
get
worse
as
the
baby
age
and
will
in
fact
lead
us
down
an
unsustainable
path
but
let
not
kid
ourselves
and
suggest
that
we
can
solve
this
problem
by
trimming
few
or
cutting
the
budget
for
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
that
just
not
true
along
with
and
interest
on
the
national
debt
the
biggest
cost
drivers
in
our
budget
are
entitlement
programs
like
and
social
security
all
of
which
get
more
and
more
expensive
every
year
so
if
we
want
to
get
serious
about
fiscal
discipline
and
do
then
we
going
to
not
only
have
to
trim
waste
out
of
our
discretionary
budget
which
we
already
begun
we
will
also
have
to
get
serious
about
entitlement
reform
now
nothing
will
be
more
important
to
this
goal
than
passing
health
care
reform
that
brings
down
costs
across
the
system
including
in
and
so
make
no
mistake
health
care
reform
is
entitlement
reform
that
not
just
my
opinion
that
was
the
conclusion
of
wide
range
of
participants
at
the
fiscal
responsibility
summit
that
we
held
at
the
white
house
in
february
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
firmly
believe
we
need
to
get
health
care
reform
done
this
year
once
we
tackle
rising
health
care
costs
we
must
also
work
to
put
social
security
on
firmer
footing
it
time
for
both
parties
to
come
together
and
find
way
to
keep
the
promise
of
sound
retirement
for
future
generations
and
we
should
restore
sense
of
fairness
and
balance
to
our
tax
code
including
by
shutting
down
corporate
loopholes
and
ensuring
that
everyone
pays
what
they
owe
all
of
these
efforts
will
require
tough
choices
all
these
efforts
will
require
compromise
but
the
difficulties
serve
as
an
excuse
for
inaction
not
anymore
which
brings
me
to
one
final
point
like
to
make
today
talked
lot
about
the
fundamental
weakness
in
our
economy
that
led
us
to
this
day
of
reckoning
but
we
also
arrived
here
because
of
fundamental
weakness
in
our
political
system
for
too
long
too
many
in
washington
put
off
hard
decisions
for
some
other
time
on
some
other
day
there
been
tendency
to
spend
lot
of
time
scoring
political
points
instead
of
rolling
up
sleeves
to
solve
real
problems
there
also
an
impatience
that
this
town
an
attention
span
that
has
only
grown
shorter
with
the
news
cycle
that
insists
on
instant
gratification
in
the
form
of
immediate
results
or
higher
poll
numbers
when
crisis
hits
there
all
too
often
lurch
from
shock
to
trance
with
everyone
responding
to
the
tempest
of
the
moment
until
the
has
died
down
the
media
coverage
has
moved
on
to
something
else
instead
of
confronting
the
major
challenges
that
will
shape
our
future
in
sustained
and
focused
way
this
be
one
of
those
times
the
challenges
are
too
great
the
stakes
are
too
high
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
members
of
congress
in
both
parties
to
grapple
with
some
of
the
big
decisions
we
face
right
now
love
if
these
problems
were
coming
at
us
one
at
time
instead
of
five
or
six
at
time
it
more
than
most
congresses
and
most
presidents
have
to
deal
with
in
lifetime
but
we
have
been
called
to
govern
in
extraordinary
times
and
that
requires
an
extraordinary
sense
of
responsibility
to
ourselves
to
the
men
and
women
who
sent
us
here
to
the
many
generations
whose
lives
will
be
affected
for
good
or
for
ill
because
of
what
we
do
here
there
is
no
doubt
that
times
are
still
tough
by
no
means
are
we
out
of
the
woods
just
yet
but
from
where
we
stand
for
the
very
first
time
we
beginning
to
see
glimmers
of
hope
and
beyond
that
way
off
in
the
distance
we
can
see
vision
of
an
america
future
that
is
far
different
than
our
troubled
economic
past
it
an
america
teeming
with
new
industry
and
commerce
humming
with
new
energy
and
discoveries
that
light
the
world
once
more
place
where
anyone
from
anywhere
with
good
idea
or
the
will
to
work
can
live
the
dream
they
heard
so
much
about
that
is
the
house
upon
the
rock
proud
sturdy
unwavering
in
the
face
of
the
greatest
storms
and
we
will
not
finish
it
in
one
year
we
will
not
finish
it
in
many
but
if
we
use
this
moment
to
lay
that
new
foundation
if
we
come
together
and
begin
the
hard
work
of
rebuilding
if
we
persist
and
persevere
against
the
disappointments
and
setbacks
that
will
surely
lie
ahead
then
have
no
doubt
that
this
house
will
stand
and
the
dream
of
our
founders
will
live
on
in
our
time
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
guys
let
me
say

iraq
first

america
band
thanks
to
all
of
you
listen
am
so
audience
member
we
love
you
president
love
you
back
am
and
grateful
to
be
with
all
of
you
and
not
going
to
talk
long
because
want
to
shake
as
many
hands
as
can
and
been
talking
all
week
but
there
couple
of
things
want
to
say
number
one
thank
you
you
know
when
was
at
camp
spoke
about
what
it
means
for
america
to
see
our
best
and
brightest
our
finest
young
men
and
women
serve
us
and
what
said
then
is
something
that
want
to
repeat
to
you
which
is
you
have
performed
brilliantly
in
every
mission
that
has
been
given
to
you
under
enormous
strain
and
under
enormous
sacrifice
through
controversy
and
difficulty
and
politics
you
kept
your
eyes
focused
on
just
doing
your
job
and
because
of
that
every
mission
that
been
assigned
from
getting
rid
of
to
reducing
violence
to
the
country
to
facilitating
elections
you
have
given
iraq
the
opportunity
to
stand
on
its
own
as
democratic
country
that
is
an
extraordinary
achievement
and
for
that
you
have
the
thanks
of
the
american
people
that
point
number
one
point
number
two
is
this
is
going
to
be
critical
period
these
next
months
was
just
discussing
this
with
your
commander
but
think
it
something
that
all
of
you
know
it
is
time
for
us
to
transition
to
the
iraqis
they
need
to
take
responsibility
for
their
country
and
for
their
sovereignty
and
in
order
for
them
to
do
that
they
have
got
to
make
political
accommodations
they
going
to
have
to
decide
that
they
want
to
resolve
their
differences
through
constitutional
means
and
legal
means
they
are
going
to
have
to
focus
on
providing
government
services
that
encourage
confidence
among
their
citizens
all
those
things
they
have
to
do
we
do
it
for
them
but
what
we
can
do
is
make
sure
that
we
are
stalwart
partner
that
we
are
working
alongside
them
that
we
are
committed
to
their
success
that
in
terms
of
training
their
security
forces
training
their
civilian
forces
in
order
to
achieve
more
effective
government
they
know
that
they
have
steady
partner
with
us
and
so
just
as
we
thank
you
for
what
you
already
accomplished
want
to
say
thank
you
because
you
will
be
critical
in
terms
of
us
being
able
to
make
sure
that
iraq
is
stable
that
it
is
not
safe
haven
for
terrorists
that
it
is
good
and
good
ally
and
we
can
start
bringing
our
folks
home
so
now
is
not
the
time
to
lose
focus
we
have
to
be
even
more
focused
than
we
been
in
order
to
achieve
success
the
last
point
want
to
make
is
know
how
hard
it
been
on
lot
of
you
you
been
away
from
your
families
many
of
you
for
multiple
rotations
you
seen
buddies
of
yours
injured
and
you
remember
those
who
have
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
there
are
probably
some
people
here
who
have
seen
children
born
and
have
been
missing
watching
them
grow
up
there
are
many
of
you
who
have
listened
to
your
spouse
and
the
extraordinary
sacrifices
that
they
have
to
make
when
you
gone
and
so
want
you
to
know
that
and
myself
are
doing
everything
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
provide
additional
support
for
military
families
the
federal
budget
that
have
introduced
increases
support
for
military
families
we
are
going
to
do
everything
required
to
make
sure
that
the
commitment
we
make
to
our
veterans
is
met
and
that
people
do
have
to
fight
for
what
they
have
earned
as
consequence
of
their
service
the
main
point
want
to
make
is
we
have
not
forgotten
what
you
have
already
done
we
are
grateful
for
what
you
will
do
and
as
long
as
am
in
the
white
house
you
are
going
to
get
the
support
that
you
need
and
the
thanks
that
you
deserve
from
grateful
nation
so
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
speaker
madam
deputy
speaker
distinguished
members
am
to
speak
in
this
chamber
and
am
committed
to
renewing
the
alliance
between
our
nations
and
the
friendship
between
our
people
this
is
my
first
trip
overseas
as
president
of
the
united
states
been
to
the
summit
in
london
and
the
nato
summit
in
and
the
european
union
summit
in
prague
some
people
have
asked
me
if
chose
to
continue
my
travels
to
ankara
and
istanbul
to
send
message
to
the
world
and
my
answer
is
simple
yes
turkey
is
critical
ally
turkey
is
an
important
part
of
europe
and
turkey
and
the
united
states
must
stand
together
and
work
together
to
overcome
the
challenges
of
our
time
this
morning
had
the
great
privilege
of
visiting
the
tomb
of
your
extraordinary
founder
of
your
republic
and
was
deeply
impressed
by
this
beautiful
memorial
to
man
who
did
so
much
to
shape
the
course
of
history
but
it
is
also
clear
that
the
greatest
monument
to
life
is
not
something
that
can
be
cast
in
stone
and
marble
his
greatest
legacy
is
turkey
strong
vibrant
secular
democracy
and
that
is
the
work
that
this
assembly
carries
on
today
this
future
was
not
easily
assured
it
was
not
guaranteed
at
the
end
of
world
war
turkey
could
have
succumbed
to
the
foreign
powers
that
were
trying
to
claim
its
territory
or
sought
to
restore
an
ancient
empire
but
turkey
chose
different
future
you
freed
yourself
from
foreign
control
and
you
founded
republic
that
commands
the
respect
of
the
united
states
and
the
wider
world
and
there
is
simple
truth
to
this
story
turkey
democracy
is
your
own
achievement
it
was
not
forced
upon
you
by
any
outside
power
nor
did
it
come
without
struggle
and
sacrifice
turkey
draws
strength
from
both
the
successes
of
the
past
and
from
the
efforts
of
each
generation
of
turks
that
makes
new
progress
for
your
people
now
my
country
democracy
has
its
own
story
the
general
who
led
america
in
revolution
and
governed
as
our
first
president
was
as
many
of
you
know
george
washington
and
like
you
we
built
grand
monument
to
our
founding
father
towering
obelisk
that
stands
in
the
heart
of
the
capital
city
that
bears
washington
name
can
see
the
washington
monument
from
the
window
of
the
white
house
every
day
it
took
decades
to
build
there
were
frequent
delays
over
time
more
and
more
people
contributed
to
help
make
this
monument
the
inspiring
structure
that
still
stands
tall
today
among
those
who
came
to
our
aid
were
friends
from
all
across
the
world
who
offered
their
own
tributes
to
washington
and
the
country
he
helped
to
found
and
one
of
those
tributes
came
from
istanbul
ottoman
sultan
sent
marble
plaque
that
helped
to
build
the
washington
monument
inscribed
in
the
plaque
was
poem
that
began
with
few
simple
words
so
as
to
strengthen
the
friendship
between
the
two
countries
over
years
have
passed
since
those
words
were
carved
into
marble
our
nations
have
changed
in
many
ways
but
our
friendship
is
strong
and
our
alliance
endures
it
is
friendship
that
flourished
in
the
years
after
world
war
when
president
committed
our
nation
to
the
of
turkey
freedom
and
sovereignty
and
turkey
committed
itself
into
the
nato
alliance
turkish
troops
have
served
by
our
side
from
korea
to
to
together
we
withstood
the
great
test
of
the
cold
war
trade
between
our
nations
has
steadily
advanced
so
has
cooperation
in
science
and
research
the
ties
among
our
people
have
deepened
as
well
and
more
and
more
americans
of
turkish
origin
live
and
work
and
succeed
within
our
borders
and
as
basketball
fan
even
noticed
that
and
have
got
some
pretty
good
basketball
games
the
united
states
and
turkey
have
not
always
agreed
on
every
issue
and
that
to
be
expected
no
two
nations
do
but
we
have
stood
together
through
many
challenges
over
the
last
years
and
because
of
the
strength
of
our
alliance
and
the
endurance
of
our
friendship
both
america
and
turkey
are
stronger
and
the
world
is
more
secure
now
our
two
democracies
are
confronted
by
an
unprecedented
set
of
challenges
an
economic
crisis
that
no
borders
extremism
that
leads
to
the
killing
of
innocent
men
and
women
and
children
strains
on
our
energy
supply
and
changing
climate
the
proliferation
of
the
world
deadliest
weapons
and
the
persistence
of
tragic
conflict
these
are
the
great
tests
of
our
young
century
and
the
choices
that
we
make
in
the
coming
years
will
determine
whether
the
future
will
be
shaped
by
fear
or
by
freedom
by
poverty
or
by
prosperity
by
strife
or
by
just
secure
and
lasting
peace
this
much
is
certain
no
one
nation
can
confront
these
challenges
alone
and
all
nations
have
stake
in
overcoming
them
that
is
why
we
must
listen
to
one
another
and
seek
common
ground
that
is
why
we
must
build
on
our
mutual
interests
and
rise
above
our
differences
we
are
stronger
when
we
act
together
that
is
the
message
that
carried
with
me
throughout
this
trip
to
europe
that
is
the
message
that
delivered
when
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
with
your
president
and
with
your
prime
minister
that
will
be
the
approach
of
the
united
states
of
america
going
forward
already
america
and
turkey
are
working
with
the
on
an
unprecedented
response
to
an
unprecedented
economic
crisis
now
this
past
week
we
came
together
to
ensure
that
the
world
largest
economies
take
strong
and
coordinated
action
to
stimulate
growth
and
restore
the
flow
of
credit
to
reject
the
pressures
of
protectionism
and
to
extend
hand
to
developing
countries
and
the
people
hit
hardest
by
this
downturn
and
to
dramatically
reform
our
regulatory
system
so
that
the
world
never
faces
crisis
like
this
again
as
we
go
forward
the
united
states
and
turkey
can
pursue
many
opportunities
to
serve
prosperity
for
our
people
the
president
and
this
morning
talked
about
expanding
the
ties
of
commerce
and
trade
there
enormous
opportunity
when
it
comes
to
energy
to
create
jobs
and
we
can
increase
new
sources
to
not
only
free
ourselves
from
dependence
of
other
energies
other
countries
energy
sources
but
also
to
combat
climate
change
we
should
build
on
our
clean
technology
fund
to
leverage
efficiency
and
renewable
energy
investments
in
turkey
and
to
power
markets
in
turkey
and
europe
the
united
states
will
continue
to
support
your
central
role
as
an
corridor
for
oil
and
natural
gas
this
economic
cooperation
only
reinforces
the
common
security
that
europe
and
the
united
states
share
with
turkey
as
nato
ally
and
the
common
values
that
we
share
as
democracies
so
in
meeting
the
challenges
of
the
century
we
must
seek
the
strength
of
europe
that
is
truly
united
peaceful
and
free
so
let
me
be
clear
the
united
states
strongly
supports
turkey
bid
to
become
member
of
the
european
union
we
speak
not
as
members
of
the
but
as
close
friends
of
both
turkey
and
europe
turkey
has
been
resolute
ally
and
responsible
partner
in
transatlantic
and
european
institutions
turkey
is
bound
to
europe
by
more
than
the
bridges
over
the
centuries
of
shared
history
culture
and
commerce
bring
you
together
europe
gains
by
the
diversity
of
ethnicity
tradition
and
faith
it
is
not
diminished
by
it
and
turkish
membership
would
broaden
and
strengthen
europe
foundation
once
more
now
of
course
turkey
has
its
own
responsibilities
and
you
made
important
progress
towards
membership
but
also
know
that
turkey
has
pursued
difficult
political
reforms
not
simply
because
it
good
for
membership
but
because
it
right
for
turkey
in
the
last
several
years
you
abolished
state
security
courts
you
expanded
the
right
to
counsel
you
reformed
the
penal
code
and
strengthened
laws
that
govern
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
assembly
you
lifted
bans
on
teaching
and
broadcasting
and
the
world
noted
with
respect
the
important
signal
sent
through
new
state
television
station
these
achievements
have
created
new
laws
that
must
be
implemented
and
momentum
that
should
be
sustained
for
democracies
can
not
be
static
they
must
move
forward
freedom
of
religion
and
expression
lead
to
strong
and
vibrant
civil
society
that
only
strengthens
the
state
which
is
why
steps
like
reopening
seminary
will
send
such
an
important
signal
inside
turkey
and
beyond
an
enduring
commitment
to
the
rule
of
law
is
the
only
way
to
achieve
the
security
that
comes
from
justice
for
all
people
robust
minority
rights
let
societies
benefit
from
the
full
measure
of
contributions
from
all
citizens
say
this
as
the
president
of
country
that
not
very
long
ago
made
it
hard
for
somebody
who
looks
like
me
to
vote
much
less
be
president
of
the
united
states
but
it
is
precisely
that
capacity
to
change
that
enriches
our
countries
every
challenge
that
we
face
is
more
easily
met
if
we
tend
to
our
own
democratic
foundation
this
work
is
never
over
that
why
in
the
united
states
we
recently
ordered
the
prison
at
bay
closed
that
why
we
prohibited
without
exception
or
equivocation
the
use
of
torture
all
of
us
have
to
change
and
sometimes
change
is
hard
another
issue
that
confronts
all
democracies
as
they
move
to
the
future
is
how
we
deal
with
the
past
the
united
states
is
still
working
through
some
of
our
own
darker
periods
in
our
history
facing
the
washington
monument
that
spoke
of
is
memorial
of
abraham
lincoln
the
man
who
freed
those
who
were
enslaved
even
after
washington
led
our
revolution
our
country
still
struggles
with
the
legacies
of
slavery
and
segregation
the
past
treatment
of
native
americans
human
is
by
its
nature
imperfect
history
is
often
tragic
but
unresolved
it
can
be
heavy
weight
each
country
must
work
through
its
past
and
reckoning
with
the
past
can
help
us
seize
better
future
know
there
strong
views
in
this
chamber
about
the
terrible
events
of
and
while
there
been
good
deal
of
commentary
about
my
views
it
really
about
how
the
turkish
and
people
deal
with
the
past
and
the
best
way
forward
for
the
turkish
and
people
is
process
that
works
through
the
past
in
way
that
is
honest
open
and
constructive
we
already
seen
historic
and
courageous
steps
taken
by
turkish
and
leaders
these
contacts
hold
out
the
promise
of
new
day
an
open
border
would
return
the
turkish
and
people
to
peaceful
and
prosperous
coexistence
that
would
serve
both
of
your
nations
so
want
you
to
know
that
the
united
states
strongly
supports
the
full
of
relations
between
turkey
and
armenia
it
is
cause
worth
working
towards
it
speaks
to
turkey
leadership
that
you
are
poised
to
be
the
only
country
in
the
region
to
have
normal
and
peaceful
relations
with
all
the
south
nations
and
to
advance
that
peace
you
can
play
constructive
role
in
helping
to
resolve
the
conflict
which
has
continued
for
far
too
long
advancing
peace
also
includes
the
disputes
that
persist
in
the
eastern
and
here
there
cause
for
hope
the
two
cypriot
leaders
have
an
opportunity
through
their
commitment
to
negotiations
under
the
united
nations
good
offices
mission
the
united
states
is
willing
to
offer
all
the
help
sought
by
the
parties
as
they
work
towards
just
and
lasting
settlement
that
cyprus
into
and
federation
these
efforts
speak
to
one
part
of
the
critical
region
that
surrounds
turkey
and
when
we
consider
the
challenges
before
us
on
issue
after
issue
we
share
common
goals
in
the
middle
east
we
share
the
goal
of
lasting
peace
between
israel
and
its
let
me
be
clear
the
united
states
strongly
supports
the
goal
of
two
states
israel
and
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
that
is
goal
shared
by
israelis
and
people
of
goodwill
around
the
world
that
is
goal
that
the
parties
agreed
to
in
the
road
map
and
at
that
is
goal
that
will
actively
pursue
as
president
of
the
united
states
we
know
the
road
ahead
will
be
difficult
both
israelis
and
must
take
steps
that
are
necessary
to
build
confidence
and
trust
both
israelis
and
both
must
live
up
to
the
commitments
they
have
made
both
must
overcome
longstanding
passions
and
the
politics
of
the
moment
to
make
progress
towards
secure
and
lasting
peace
the
united
states
and
turkey
can
help
the
and
israelis
make
this
journey
like
the
united
states
turkey
has
been
friend
and
partner
in
israel
quest
for
security
and
like
the
united
states
you
seek
future
of
opportunity
and
statehood
for
the
so
now
working
together
we
must
not
give
into
pessimism
and
mistrust
we
must
pursue
every
opportunity
for
progress
as
you
done
by
supporting
negotiations
between
syria
and
israel
we
must
extend
hand
to
those
who
are
in
need
while
helping
them
strengthen
their
own
institutions
we
must
reject
the
use
of
terror
and
that
israel
security
concerns
are
legitimate
the
peace
of
the
region
will
also
be
advanced
if
iran
any
nuclear
weapons
ambitions
now
as
made
clear
in
prague
yesterday
no
one
is
served
by
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
least
of
all
turkey
you
live
in
difficult
region
and
nuclear
arm
race
would
not
serve
the
security
of
this
nation
well
this
part
of
the
world
has
known
enough
violence
it
has
known
enough
hatred
it
does
not
need
race
for
an
powerful
tool
of
destruction
now
have
made
it
clear
to
the
people
and
leaders
of
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
that
the
united
states
seeks
engagement
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
we
want
iran
to
play
its
rightful
role
in
the
community
of
nations
iran
is
great
we
want
them
to
engage
in
the
economic
and
political
integration
that
brings
prosperity
and
security
but
iran
leaders
must
choose
whether
they
will
try
to
build
weapon
or
build
better
future
for
their
people
so
both
turkey
and
the
united
states
support
secure
and
united
iraq
that
does
not
serve
as
safe
haven
for
terrorists
know
there
were
differences
about
whether
to
go
to
war
there
were
differences
within
my
own
country
as
well
but
now
we
must
come
together
as
we
end
this
war
responsibly
because
the
future
of
iraq
is
inseparable
from
the
future
of
the
broader
region
as
already
announced
and
many
of
you
are
aware
the
united
states
will
remove
our
combat
brigades
by
the
end
of
next
august
while
working
with
the
iraqi
government
as
they
take
responsibility
for
security
and
we
will
work
with
iraq
turkey
and
all
iraq
to
forge
new
dialogue
that
reconciles
differences
and
advances
our
common
security
make
no
mistake
though
iraq
turkey
and
the
united
states
face
common
threat
from
terrorism
that
includes
the
terrorists
who
have
sought
to
drive
iraqis
apart
and
destroy
their
country
that
includes
the
there
is
no
excuse
for
terror
against
any
nation
as
president
and
as
nato
ally
pledge
that
you
will
have
our
support
against
the
terrorist
activities
of
the
or
anyone
else
these
efforts
will
be
strengthened
by
the
continued
work
to
build
ties
of
cooperation
between
turkey
the
iraqi
government
and
iraq
leaders
and
by
your
continued
efforts
to
promote
education
and
opportunity
and
democracy
for
the
population
here
inside
turkey
finally
we
share
the
common
goal
of
denying
safe
haven
in
pakistan
or
the
world
has
come
too
far
to
let
this
region
and
to
let
terrorists
plot
further
attacks
that
why
we
are
committed
to
more
focused
effort
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
that
is
why
we
are
increasing
our
efforts
to
train
afghans
to
sustain
their
own
security
and
to
reconcile
former
adversaries
that
why
we
are
increasing
our
support
for
the
people
of
and
pakistan
so
that
we
stand
on
the
side
not
only
of
security
but
also
of
opportunity
and
the
promise
of
better
life
turkey
has
been
true
partner
your
troops
were
among
the
first
in
the
international
security
assistance
force
you
have
sacrificed
much
in
this
now
we
must
achieve
our
goals
together
appreciate
that
you
offered
to
help
us
train
and
support
afghan
security
forces
and
expand
opportunity
across
the
region
together
we
can
rise
to
meet
this
challenge
like
we
have
so
many
before
know
there
have
been
difficulties
these
last
few
years
know
that
the
trust
that
binds
the
united
states
and
turkey
has
been
strained
and
know
that
strain
is
shared
in
many
places
where
the
muslim
faith
is
so
let
me
say
this
as
clearly
as
can
the
united
states
is
not
and
will
never
be
at
war
with
islam
in
fact
our
partnership
with
the
muslim
world
is
critical
not
just
in
rolling
back
the
violent
ideologies
that
people
of
all
faiths
reject
but
also
to
strengthen
opportunity
for
all
its
people
also
want
to
be
clear
that
america
relationship
with
the
muslim
community
the
muslim
world
can
not
and
will
not
just
be
based
upon
opposition
to
terrorism
we
seek
broader
engagement
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
we
will
listen
carefully
we
will
bridge
misunderstandings
and
we
will
seek
common
ground
we
will
be
respectful
even
when
we
do
not
agree
we
will
convey
our
deep
appreciation
for
the
islamic
faith
which
has
done
so
much
over
the
centuries
to
shape
the
world
including
in
my
own
country
the
united
states
has
been
enriched
by
muslim
americans
many
other
americans
have
muslims
in
their
families
or
have
lived
in
country
know
because
am
one
of
them
above
all
above
all
we
will
demonstrate
through
actions
our
commitment
to
better
future
want
to
help
more
children
get
the
education
that
they
need
to
succeed
we
want
to
promote
health
care
in
places
where
people
are
vulnerable
we
want
to
expand
the
trade
and
investment
that
can
bring
prosperity
for
all
people
in
the
months
ahead
will
present
specific
programs
to
advance
these
goals
our
focus
will
be
on
what
we
can
do
in
partnership
with
people
across
the
muslim
world
to
advance
our
common
hopes
and
our
common
dreams
and
when
people
look
back
on
this
time
let
it
be
said
of
america
that
we
extended
the
hand
of
friendship
to
all
people
there
an
old
turkish
proverb
you
can
not
put
out
fire
with
flames
america
knows
this
turkey
knows
this
there
some
who
must
be
met
by
force
they
will
not
compromise
but
force
alone
can
not
solve
our
problems
and
it
is
no
alternative
to
extremism
the
future
must
belong
to
those
who
create
not
those
who
destroy
that
is
the
future
we
must
work
for
and
we
must
work
for
it
together
know
there
are
those
who
like
to
debate
turkey
future
they
see
your
country
at
the
crossroads
of
continents
and
touched
by
the
currents
of
history
they
know
that
this
has
been
place
where
meet
and
different
peoples
come
together
they
wonder
whether
you
will
be
pulled
in
one
direction
or
another
but
believe
here
is
what
they
do
understand
turkey
greatness
lies
in
your
ability
to
be
at
the
of
things
this
is
not
where
east
and
west
divide
this
is
where
they
come
together
in
the
beauty
of
your
culture
in
the
richness
of
your
history
in
the
strength
of
your
democracy
in
your
hopes
for
tomorrow
am
to
stand
here
with
you
to
look
forward
to
the
future
that
we
must
reach
for
together
and
to
reaffirm
america
commitment
to
our
strong
and
enduring
friendship
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
for
this
wonderful
welcome
thank
you
to
the
people
of
prague
thank
you
to
the
people
of
the
czech
republic
today
proud
to
stand
here
with
you
in
the
middle
of
this
great
city
in
the
of
europe
and
to
paraphrase
one
of
my
predecessors
am
also
proud
to
be
the
man
who
brought
to
to
president
prime
minister
to
all
the
dignitaries
who
are
here
thank
you
for
your
extraordinary
hospitality
and
to
the
people
of
the
czech
republic
thank
you
for
your
friendship
to
the
united
states
learned
over
many
years
to
appreciate
the
good
company
and
the
good
of
the
czech
people
in
my
of
chicago
behind
me
is
statue
of
hero
of
the
czech
people
in
after
america
had
pledged
its
support
for
czech
independence
spoke
to
crowd
in
chicago
that
was
estimated
to
be
over
do
think
can
match
his
record
but
am
to
follow
his
footsteps
from
chicago
to
prague
for
over
thousand
years
prague
has
set
itself
apart
from
any
other
city
in
any
other
place
you
known
war
and
peace
you
seen
empires
rise
and
fall
you
led
revolutions
in
the
arts
and
science
in
politics
and
in
poetry
through
it
all
the
people
of
prague
have
insisted
on
pursuing
their
own
path
and
defining
their
own
destiny
and
this
city
this
golden
city
which
is
both
ancient
and
youthful
stands
as
living
monument
to
your
unconquerable
spirit
when
was
born
the
world
was
divided
and
our
nations
were
faced
with
very
different
circumstances
few
people
would
have
predicted
that
someone
like
me
would
one
day
become
the
president
of
the
united
states
few
people
would
have
predicted
that
an
american
president
would
one
day
be
permitted
to
speak
to
an
audience
like
this
in
prague
few
would
have
imagined
that
the
czech
republic
would
become
free
nation
member
of
nato
leader
of
united
europe
those
ideas
would
have
been
dismissed
as
dreams
we
are
here
today
because
enough
people
ignored
the
voices
who
told
them
that
the
world
could
not
change
we
here
today
because
of
the
courage
of
those
who
stood
up
and
took
risks
to
say
that
freedom
is
right
for
all
people
no
matter
what
side
of
wall
they
live
on
and
no
matter
what
they
look
like
we
are
here
today
because
of
the
prague
spring
because
the
simple
and
principled
pursuit
of
liberty
and
opportunity
shamed
those
who
relied
on
the
power
of
tanks
and
arms
to
put
down
the
will
of
people
we
are
here
today
because
years
ago
the
people
of
this
city
took
to
the
streets
to
claim
the
promise
of
new
day
and
the
fundamental
human
rights
that
had
been
denied
them
for
far
too
long
the
velvet
revolution
taught
us
many
things
it
showed
us
that
peaceful
protest
could
shake
the
foundations
of
an
empire
and
expose
the
emptiness
of
an
ideology
it
showed
us
that
small
countries
can
play
pivotal
role
in
world
events
and
that
young
people
can
lead
the
way
in
overcoming
old
conflicts
and
it
proved
that
moral
leadership
is
more
powerful
than
any
weapon
that
why
speaking
to
you
in
the
of
europe
that
is
peaceful
united
and
free
because
ordinary
people
believed
that
divisions
could
be
bridged
even
when
their
leaders
did
not
they
believed
that
walls
could
come
down
that
peace
could
prevail
we
are
here
today
because
americans
and
czechs
believed
against
all
odds
that
today
could
be
possible
now
we
share
this
common
history
but
now
this
generation
our
generation
can
not
stand
still
we
too
have
choice
to
make
as
the
world
has
become
less
divided
it
has
become
more
interconnected
and
we
seen
events
move
faster
than
our
ability
to
control
them
global
economy
in
crisis
changing
climate
the
persistent
dangers
of
old
conflicts
new
threats
and
the
spread
of
catastrophic
weapons
none
of
these
challenges
can
be
solved
quickly
or
easily
but
all
of
them
demand
that
we
listen
to
one
another
and
work
together
that
we
focus
on
our
common
interests
not
on
occasional
differences
and
that
we
reaffirm
our
shared
values
which
are
stronger
than
any
force
that
could
drive
us
apart
that
is
the
work
that
we
must
carry
on
that
is
the
work
that
have
come
to
europe
to
begin
to
renew
our
prosperity
we
need
action
coordinated
across
borders
that
means
investments
to
create
new
jobs
that
means
resisting
the
walls
of
protectionism
that
stand
in
the
way
of
growth
that
means
change
in
our
financial
system
with
new
rules
to
prevent
abuse
and
future
crisis
and
we
have
an
obligation
to
our
common
prosperity
and
our
common
humanity
to
extend
hand
to
those
emerging
markets
and
impoverished
people
who
are
suffering
the
most
even
though
they
may
have
had
very
little
to
do
with
financial
crises
which
is
why
we
set
aside
over
trillion
dollars
for
the
international
monetary
fund
earlier
this
week
to
make
sure
that
everybody
everybody
receives
some
assistance
now
to
protect
our
planet
now
is
the
time
to
change
the
way
that
we
use
energy
together
we
must
confront
climate
change
by
ending
the
world
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
by
tapping
the
power
of
new
sources
of
energy
like
the
wind
and
sun
and
calling
upon
all
nations
to
do
their
part
and
pledge
to
you
that
in
this
global
effort
the
united
states
is
now
ready
to
lead
to
provide
for
our
common
security
we
must
strengthen
our
alliance
nato
was
founded
years
ago
after
communism
took
over
that
was
when
the
free
world
learned
too
late
that
it
could
not
afford
division
so
we
came
together
to
forge
the
strongest
alliance
that
the
world
has
ever
known
and
we
should
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
year
after
year
decade
after
decade
until
an
iron
curtain
was
lifted
and
freedom
spread
like
flowing
water
this
marks
the
year
of
nato
membership
for
the
czech
republic
and
know
that
many
times
in
the
century
decisions
were
made
without
you
at
the
table
great
powers
let
you
down
or
determined
your
destiny
without
your
voice
being
heard
am
here
to
say
that
the
united
states
will
never
turn
its
back
on
the
people
of
this
nation
we
are
bound
by
shared
values
shared
history
we
are
bound
by
shared
values
and
shared
history
and
the
enduring
promise
of
our
alliance
nato
article
states
it
clearly
an
attack
on
one
is
an
attack
on
all
that
is
promise
for
our
time
and
for
all
time
the
people
of
the
czech
republic
kept
that
promise
after
america
was
attacked
thousands
were
killed
on
our
soil
and
nato
responded
nato
mission
in
is
fundamental
to
the
safety
of
people
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
we
are
targeting
the
same
terrorists
who
have
struck
from
new
york
to
london
and
helping
the
afghan
people
take
responsibility
for
their
future
we
are
demonstrating
that
free
nations
can
make
common
cause
on
behalf
of
our
common
security
and
want
you
to
know
that
we
the
sacrifices
of
the
czech
people
in
this
and
mourn
the
loss
of
those
you
lost
but
no
alliance
can
afford
to
stand
still
we
must
work
together
as
nato
members
so
that
we
have
contingency
plans
in
place
to
deal
with
new
threats
wherever
they
may
come
from
we
must
strengthen
our
cooperation
with
one
another
and
with
other
nations
and
institutions
around
the
world
to
confront
dangers
that
no
borders
and
we
must
pursue
constructive
relations
with
russia
on
issues
of
common
concern
now
one
of
those
issues
that
focus
on
today
is
fundamental
to
the
security
of
our
nations
and
to
the
peace
of
the
world
that
the
future
of
nuclear
weapons
in
the
century
the
existence
of
thousands
of
nuclear
weapons
is
the
most
dangerous
legacy
of
the
cold
war
no
nuclear
war
was
fought
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
but
generations
lived
with
the
knowledge
that
their
world
could
be
erased
in
single
flash
of
light
cities
like
prague
that
existed
for
centuries
that
embodied
the
beauty
and
the
talent
of
so
much
of
humanity
would
have
ceased
to
exist
today
the
cold
war
has
disappeared
but
thousands
of
those
weapons
have
not
in
strange
turn
of
history
the
threat
of
global
nuclear
war
has
gone
down
but
the
risk
of
nuclear
attack
has
gone
up
more
nations
have
acquired
these
weapons
testing
has
continued
black
market
trade
in
nuclear
secrets
and
nuclear
materials
abound
the
technology
to
build
bomb
has
spread
terrorists
are
determined
to
buy
build
or
steal
one
our
efforts
to
contain
these
dangers
are
on
global
regime
but
as
more
people
and
nations
break
the
rules
we
could
reach
the
point
where
the
can
not
hold
now
understand
this
matters
to
people
everywhere
one
nuclear
weapon
exploded
in
one
city
be
it
new
york
or
moscow
or
tokyo
or
paris
or
prague
could
kill
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
and
no
matter
where
it
happens
there
is
no
end
to
what
the
consequences
might
be
for
our
global
safety
our
security
our
society
our
economy
to
our
ultimate
survival
some
argue
that
the
spread
of
these
weapons
can
not
be
stopped
can
not
be
checked
that
we
are
destined
to
live
in
world
where
more
nations
and
more
people
possess
the
ultimate
tools
of
destruction
such
fatalism
is
deadly
adversary
for
if
we
believe
that
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
is
inevitable
then
in
some
way
we
are
admitting
to
ourselves
that
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
is
inevitable
just
as
we
stood
for
freedom
in
the
century
we
must
stand
together
for
the
right
of
people
everywhere
to
live
free
from
fear
in
the
century
and
as
nuclear
power
as
nuclear
power
as
the
only
nuclear
power
to
have
used
nuclear
weapon
the
united
states
has
moral
responsibility
to
act
we
can
not
succeed
in
this
alone
but
we
can
lead
it
we
can
start
it
so
today
state
clearly
and
with
conviction
america
commitment
to
seek
the
peace
and
security
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
not
naive
this
goal
will
not
be
reached
quickly
perhaps
not
in
my
lifetime
it
will
take
patience
and
persistence
but
now
we
too
must
ignore
the
voices
who
tell
us
that
the
world
can
not
change
we
have
to
insist
yes
we
can
now
let
me
describe
to
you
the
trajectory
we
need
to
be
on
first
the
united
states
will
take
concrete
steps
towards
world
without
nuclear
weapons
to
put
an
end
to
cold
war
thinking
we
will
reduce
the
role
of
nuclear
weapons
in
our
national
security
strategy
and
urge
others
to
do
the
same
make
no
mistake
as
long
as
these
weapons
exist
the
united
states
will
maintain
safe
secure
and
effective
arsenal
to
deter
any
adversary
and
guarantee
that
to
our
allies
including
the
czech
republic
but
we
will
begin
the
work
of
reducing
our
arsenal
to
reduce
our
warheads
and
stockpiles
we
will
negotiate
new
strategic
arms
reduction
treaty
with
the
this
year
president
and
began
this
process
in
london
and
will
seek
new
agreement
by
the
end
of
this
year
that
is
legally
binding
and
sufficiently
bold
and
this
will
set
the
stage
for
further
cuts
and
we
will
seek
to
include
all
nuclear
weapons
states
in
this
to
achieve
global
ban
on
nuclear
testing
my
administration
will
immediately
and
aggressively
pursue
ratification
of
the
comprehensive
test
ban
treaty
after
more
than
five
decades
of
talks
it
is
time
for
the
testing
of
nuclear
weapons
to
finally
be
banned
and
to
cut
off
the
building
blocks
needed
for
bomb
the
united
states
will
seek
new
treaty
that
ends
the
production
of
fissile
materials
intended
for
use
in
state
nuclear
weapons
if
we
are
serious
about
stopping
the
spread
of
these
weapons
then
we
should
put
an
end
to
the
dedicated
production
of
materials
that
create
them
that
the
first
step
second
together
we
will
strengthen
the
nuclear
treaty
as
basis
for
cooperation
the
basic
bargain
is
sound
countries
with
nuclear
weapons
will
move
towards
disarmament
countries
without
nuclear
weapons
will
not
acquire
them
and
all
countries
can
access
peaceful
nuclear
energy
to
strengthen
the
treaty
we
should
embrace
several
principles
we
need
more
resources
and
authority
to
strengthen
international
inspections
we
need
real
and
immediate
consequences
for
countries
caught
breaking
the
rules
or
trying
to
leave
the
treaty
without
cause
and
we
should
build
new
framework
for
civil
nuclear
cooperation
including
an
international
fuel
bank
so
that
countries
can
access
peaceful
power
without
increasing
the
risks
of
proliferation
that
must
be
the
right
of
every
nation
that
renounces
nuclear
weapons
especially
developing
countries
embarking
on
peaceful
programs
and
no
approach
will
succeed
if
it
based
on
the
denial
of
rights
to
nations
that
play
by
the
rules
we
must
harness
the
power
of
nuclear
energy
on
behalf
of
our
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
and
to
advance
peace
opportunity
for
all
people
but
we
go
forward
with
no
illusions
some
countries
will
break
the
rules
that
why
we
need
structure
in
place
that
ensures
when
any
nation
does
they
will
face
consequences
just
this
morning
we
were
reminded
again
of
why
we
need
new
and
more
rigorous
approach
to
address
this
threat
north
korea
broke
the
rules
once
again
by
testing
rocket
that
could
be
used
for
long
range
missiles
this
provocation
the
need
for
action
not
just
this
afternoon
at
the
security
council
but
in
our
determination
to
prevent
the
spread
of
these
weapons
rules
must
be
binding
violations
must
be
punished
words
must
mean
something
the
world
must
stand
together
to
prevent
the
spread
of
these
weapons
now
is
the
time
for
strong
international
response
now
is
the
time
for
strong
international
response
and
north
korea
must
know
that
the
path
to
security
and
respect
will
never
come
through
threats
and
illegal
weapons
all
nations
must
come
together
to
build
stronger
global
regime
and
that
why
we
must
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
to
pressure
the
north
koreans
to
change
course
iran
has
yet
to
build
nuclear
weapon
my
administration
will
seek
engagement
with
iran
based
on
mutual
interests
and
mutual
respect
we
believe
in
dialogue
but
in
that
dialogue
we
will
present
clear
choice
we
want
iran
to
take
its
rightful
place
in
the
community
of
nations
politically
and
economically
we
will
support
iran
right
to
peaceful
nuclear
energy
with
rigorous
inspections
that
path
that
the
islamic
republic
can
take
or
the
government
can
choose
increased
isolation
international
pressure
and
potential
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
region
that
will
increase
insecurity
for
all
so
let
me
be
clear
iran
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
activity
poses
real
threat
not
just
to
the
united
states
but
to
iran
and
our
allies
the
czech
republic
and
poland
have
been
courageous
in
agreeing
to
host
against
these
missiles
as
long
as
the
threat
from
iran
persists
we
will
go
forward
with
missile
system
that
is
and
proven
if
the
iranian
threat
is
eliminated
we
will
have
stronger
basis
for
security
and
the
driving
force
for
missile
construction
in
europe
will
be
removed
so
finally
we
must
ensure
that
terrorists
never
acquire
nuclear
weapon
this
is
the
most
immediate
and
extreme
threat
to
global
security
one
terrorist
with
one
nuclear
weapon
could
unleash
massive
destruction
has
said
it
seeks
bomb
and
that
it
would
have
no
problem
with
using
it
and
we
know
that
there
is
unsecured
nuclear
material
across
the
globe
to
protect
our
people
we
must
act
with
sense
of
purpose
without
delay
so
today
am
announcing
new
international
effort
to
secure
all
vulnerable
nuclear
material
around
the
world
within
four
years
we
will
set
new
standards
expand
our
cooperation
with
russia
pursue
new
partnerships
to
lock
down
these
sensitive
materials
we
must
also
build
on
our
efforts
to
break
up
black
markets
detect
and
intercept
materials
in
transit
and
use
financial
tools
to
disrupt
this
dangerous
trade
because
this
threat
will
be
lasting
we
should
come
together
to
turn
efforts
such
as
the
proliferation
security
initiative
and
the
global
initiative
to
combat
nuclear
terrorism
into
durable
international
institutions
and
we
should
start
by
having
global
summit
on
nuclear
security
that
the
united
states
will
host
within
the
next
year
now
know
that
there
are
some
who
will
question
whether
we
can
act
on
such
broad
agenda
there
are
those
who
doubt
whether
true
international
cooperation
is
possible
given
inevitable
differences
among
nations
and
there
are
those
who
hear
talk
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
and
doubt
whether
it
worth
setting
goal
that
seems
impossible
to
achieve
but
make
no
mistake
we
know
where
that
road
leads
when
nations
and
peoples
allow
themselves
to
be
defined
by
their
differences
the
gulf
between
them
widens
when
we
fail
to
pursue
peace
then
it
stays
forever
beyond
our
grasp
we
know
the
path
when
we
choose
fear
over
hope
to
denounce
or
shrug
off
call
for
cooperation
is
an
easy
but
also
cowardly
thing
to
do
that
how
wars
begin
that
where
human
progress
ends
there
is
violence
and
injustice
in
our
world
that
must
be
confronted
we
must
confront
it
not
by
splitting
apart
but
by
standing
together
as
free
nations
as
free
people
know
that
call
to
arms
can
stir
the
souls
of
men
and
women
more
than
call
to
lay
them
down
but
that
is
why
the
voices
for
peace
and
progress
must
be
raised
together
those
are
the
voices
that
still
echo
through
the
streets
of
prague
those
are
the
ghosts
of
those
were
the
joyful
sounds
of
the
velvet
revolution
those
were
the
czechs
who
helped
bring
down
empire
without
firing
shot
human
destiny
will
be
what
we
make
of
it
and
here
in
prague
let
us
our
past
by
reaching
for
better
future
let
us
bridge
our
divisions
build
upon
our
hopes
accept
our
responsibility
to
leave
this
world
more
prosperous
and
more
peaceful
than
we
found
it
together
we
can
do
it
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
prague
thank
you
so
much
good
afternoon
and
tag
it
is
great
for
me
to
be
here
in
europe
to
be
here
in
want
to
make
just
few
acknowledgements
want
to
thank
the
president
of
france
for
being
such
terrific
friend
want
to
thank
his
wife
madam
they
just
hosted
us
at
the
palace
and
could
not
have
been
more
gracious
want
to
thank
the
charge
mark
and
his
wife
maria
who
were
helping
to
us
carver
who
the
counsel
general
in
and
want
to
thank
the
mayor
of
for
his
hospitality
it
is
wonderful
to
be
here
with
all
of
you
and
to
have
an
opportunity
not
only
to
speak
to
you
but
also
to
take
some
questions
you
know
during
these
foreign
trips
you
see
everything
from
behind
window
and
what
we
thought
was
important
was
for
me
to
have
an
opportunity
to
not
only
speak
with
you
but
also
to
hear
from
you
because
that
ultimately
how
we
can
learn
about
each
other
but
before
take
some
questions
hope
you
do
mind
me
making
few
remarks
about
my
country
and
yours
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
relationship
between
europe
has
been
known
throughout
history
as
city
at
the
crossroads
over
thousands
of
years
you
straddled
many
kingdoms
and
many
cultures
two
rivers
are
joined
here
two
religions
have
flourished
in
your
churches
three
languages
comprise
an
ancient
oath
that
bears
the
city
name
you
served
as
of
industry
and
commerce
seat
of
government
and
education
where
goethe
studied
and
pasteur
taught
and
imagined
his
printing
press
so
it
fitting
because
we
find
ourselves
at
crossroads
as
well
all
of
us
for
we
arrived
at
moment
where
each
nation
and
every
citizen
must
choose
at
last
how
we
respond
to
world
that
has
grown
smaller
and
more
connected
than
at
any
time
in
its
existence
we
known
for
long
time
that
the
revolutions
in
communications
and
technology
that
took
place
in
the
century
would
hold
out
enormous
promise
for
the
century
the
promise
of
broader
prosperity
and
mobility
of
new
breakthroughs
and
discoveries
that
could
help
us
lead
richer
and
fuller
lives
but
the
same
forces
that
have
brought
us
closer
together
have
also
given
rise
to
new
dangers
that
threaten
to
tear
our
world
apart
dangers
that
can
not
be
contained
by
the
nearest
border
or
the
furthest
ocean
even
with
the
cold
war
now
over
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
or
the
theft
of
nuclear
material
could
lead
to
the
extermination
of
any
city
on
the
planet
and
this
weekend
in
prague
will
lay
out
an
agenda
to
seek
the
goal
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
we
also
know
that
the
pollution
from
cars
in
boston
or
from
factories
in
beijing
are
melting
the
ice
caps
in
the
arctic
and
that
that
will
disrupt
weather
patterns
everywhere
the
terrorists
who
struck
in
london
in
new
york
plotted
in
distant
caves
and
simple
apartments
much
closer
to
your
home
and
the
reckless
speculation
of
bankers
that
has
new
global
economic
downturn
that
inflicting
pain
on
workers
and
families
is
happening
everywhere
all
across
the
globe
the
economic
crisis
has
proven
the
fact
of
our
interdependence
in
the
most
visible
way
yet
not
more
than
generation
ago
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
inability
of
somebody
to
pay
for
house
in
florida
could
contribute
to
the
failure
of
the
banking
system
in
iceland
today
what
difficult
to
imagine
is
that
we
did
not
act
sooner
to
shape
our
future
now
there
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around
for
what
has
happened
and
the
united
states
certainly
shares
its
shares
blame
for
what
has
happened
but
every
nation
bears
responsibility
for
what
lies
ahead
especially
now
for
whether
it
the
recession
or
climate
change
or
terrorism
or
drug
trafficking
poverty
or
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons
we
have
learned
that
without
doubt
there
no
quarter
of
the
globe
that
can
wall
itself
off
from
the
threats
of
the
century
the
one
way
forward
the
only
way
forward
is
through
common
and
persistent
effort
to
combat
fear
and
want
wherever
they
exist
that
is
the
challenge
of
our
time
and
we
can
not
fail
to
meet
it
together
now
we
take
for
granted
the
peace
of
europe
that
united
but
for
centuries
has
been
attacked
and
occupied
and
claimed
by
the
warring
nations
of
this
continent
now
today
in
this
city
the
presence
of
the
european
parliament
and
the
council
of
europe
stand
as
symbols
of
europe
that
is
united
peaceful
and
free
now
we
take
this
peace
and
prosperity
for
granted
but
this
destination
was
not
easily
reached
nor
was
it
predestined
the
buildings
that
are
now
living
monuments
to
european
unity
were
not
drawn
from
simple
blueprints
they
were
born
out
of
the
blood
of
the
first
half
of
the
century
and
the
resolve
of
the
second
men
and
women
had
to
have
the
imagination
to
see
better
future
and
the
courage
to
reach
for
it
and
americans
had
to
have
the
sense
of
common
purpose
to
join
one
another
and
the
patience
and
the
persistence
to
see
long
twilight
struggle
through
it
was
years
ago
this
april
that
plan
to
rebuild
europe
helped
to
deliver
hope
to
continent
that
had
been
decimated
by
war
amid
the
ashes
and
the
rubble
that
surrounded
so
many
cities
like
this
one
america
joined
with
you
in
an
unprecedented
effort
that
secured
lasting
prosperity
not
just
in
europe
but
around
the
world
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
one
year
later
exactly
years
ago
tomorrow
we
ensured
our
shared
security
when
of
our
nations
signed
treaty
in
washington
that
spelled
out
simple
agreement
an
attack
on
one
would
be
viewed
as
an
attack
on
all
without
firing
single
shot
this
alliance
would
prevent
the
iron
curtain
from
descending
on
the
free
nations
of
western
europe
it
would
lead
eventually
to
the
crumbling
of
wall
in
berlin
and
the
end
of
the
communist
threat
two
decades
later
with
member
nations
that
stretched
from
the
baltic
to
the
nato
remains
the
strongest
alliance
that
the
world
has
ever
known
at
the
crossroads
where
we
stand
today
this
shared
history
gives
us
hope
but
it
must
not
give
us
rest
this
generation
can
not
stand
still
we
can
not
be
content
merely
to
celebrate
the
achievements
of
the
century
or
enjoy
the
comforts
of
the
century
we
must
learn
from
the
past
to
build
on
its
success
we
must
renew
our
institutions
our
alliances
we
must
seek
the
solutions
to
the
challenges
of
this
young
century
this
is
our
generation
this
is
our
time
and
am
confident
that
we
can
meet
any
challenge
as
long
as
we
are
together
such
an
effort
is
never
easy
it
always
harder
to
forge
true
partnerships
and
sturdy
alliances
than
to
act
alone
or
to
wait
for
the
action
of
somebody
else
it
more
difficult
to
break
down
walls
of
division
than
to
simply
allow
our
differences
to
build
and
our
resentments
to
fester
so
we
must
be
honest
with
ourselves
in
recent
years
we
allowed
our
alliance
to
drift
know
that
there
have
been
honest
disagreements
over
policy
but
we
also
know
that
there
something
more
that
has
crept
into
our
relationship
in
america
there
failure
to
appreciate
europe
leading
role
in
the
world
instead
of
celebrating
your
dynamic
union
and
seeking
to
partner
with
you
to
meet
common
challenges
there
have
been
times
where
america
has
shown
arrogance
and
been
dismissive
even
derisive
but
in
europe
there
is
an
that
is
at
once
casual
but
can
also
be
insidious
instead
of
the
good
that
america
so
often
does
in
the
world
there
have
been
times
where
choose
to
blame
america
for
much
of
what
bad
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
these
attitudes
have
become
all
too
common
they
are
not
wise
they
do
not
represent
the
truth
they
threaten
to
widen
the
divide
across
the
atlantic
and
leave
us
both
more
isolated
they
fail
to
acknowledge
the
fundamental
truth
that
america
can
not
confront
the
challenges
of
this
century
alone
but
that
europe
can
not
confront
them
without
america
so
come
to
europe
this
week
to
renew
our
partnership
one
in
which
america
listens
and
learns
from
our
friends
and
allies
but
where
our
friends
and
allies
bear
their
share
of
the
burden
together
we
must
forge
common
solutions
to
our
common
problems
so
let
me
say
this
as
clearly
as
can
america
is
changing
but
it
can
not
be
america
alone
that
changes
we
are
confronting
the
greatest
economic
crisis
since
world
war
the
only
way
to
confront
this
unprecedented
crisis
is
through
unprecedented
coordination
over
the
last
few
days
believe
that
we
have
begun
that
effort
the
summit
in
london
was
success
of
nations
coming
together
working
out
their
differences
and
moving
boldly
forward
all
of
us
are
moving
aggressively
to
restore
growth
and
lending
all
of
us
have
agreed
to
the
most
substantial
overhaul
of
our
international
financial
system
in
generation
no
one
is
exempt
no
more
will
the
world
financial
players
be
able
to
make
risky
bets
at
the
expense
of
ordinary
people
those
days
are
over
we
are
ushering
new
era
of
responsibility
and
that
is
something
we
should
all
be
proud
of
as
we
take
these
steps
we
also
affirm
that
we
must
not
erect
new
barriers
to
commerce
that
trade
wars
have
no
victors
we
give
up
on
open
markets
even
as
we
work
to
ensure
that
trade
is
both
free
and
fair
we
can
not
forget
how
many
millions
that
trade
has
lifted
out
of
poverty
and
into
the
middle
class
we
forget
that
part
of
the
freedom
that
our
nations
stood
for
throughout
the
cold
war
was
the
opportunity
that
comes
from
free
enterprise
and
individual
liberty
know
it
can
be
tempting
to
turn
inward
and
understand
how
many
people
and
nations
have
been
left
behind
by
the
global
economy
and
that
why
the
united
states
is
leading
an
effort
to
reach
out
to
people
around
the
world
who
are
suffering
to
provide
them
immediate
assistance
and
to
extend
support
for
food
security
that
will
help
them
lift
themselves
out
of
poverty
all
of
us
must
join
together
in
this
effort
not
just
because
it
is
right
but
because
by
providing
assistance
to
those
countries
most
in
need
we
will
provide
new
markets
we
will
drive
the
growth
of
the
future
that
lifts
all
of
us
up
so
it
not
just
charity
it
matter
of
understanding
that
our
fates
are
tied
together
not
just
the
fate
of
europe
and
america
but
the
fate
of
the
entire
world
and
as
we
restore
our
common
prosperity
we
must
stand
up
for
our
common
security
as
we
meet
here
today
nato
has
still
embarked
on
its
first
mission
overseas
in
and
my
administration
has
just
completed
review
of
our
policy
in
that
region
now
understand
that
this
war
has
been
long
our
allies
have
already
contributed
greatly
to
this
you
sent
your
sons
and
daughters
to
fight
alongside
ours
and
we
and
respect
their
service
and
sacrifice
and
also
know
that
there
some
who
have
asked
questions
about
why
are
we
still
in
what
does
this
mean
what
its
purpose
understand
we
would
not
deploy
our
own
troops
if
this
mission
was
not
indispensable
to
our
common
security
as
president
can
tell
you
there
no
decision
more
difficult
there
no
duty
more
painful
than
signing
letter
to
the
family
of
somebody
who
has
died
in
war
so
understand
that
there
is
doubt
about
this
war
in
europe
there
doubt
at
times
even
in
the
united
states
but
know
this
the
united
states
of
america
did
not
choose
to
fight
war
in
we
were
attacked
by
an
network
that
killed
thousands
on
american
soil
including
french
and
germans
along
the
border
of
and
pakistan
those
terrorists
are
still
plotting
today
and
they
if
there
is
another
attack
it
is
just
as
likely
if
not
more
that
it
will
be
here
in
europe
in
european
city
so
made
commitment
to
and
asked
our
nato
partners
for
more
civilian
and
military
support
and
assistance
we
do
this
with
clear
purpose
to
root
out
the
terrorists
who
threaten
all
of
us
to
train
the
afghan
people
to
sustain
their
own
security
and
to
help
them
advance
their
own
opportunity
and
to
quicken
the
day
when
our
troops
come
home
we
have
no
interest
in
occupying
we
have
more
than
enough
to
do
in
rebuilding
america
but
this
is
mission
that
tests
whether
nations
can
come
together
in
common
purpose
on
behalf
of
our
common
security
that
what
we
did
together
in
the
century
and
now
we
need
an
alliance
that
is
even
stronger
than
when
it
brought
down
mighty
wall
in
berlin
that
why
we
applaud
france
decision
to
expand
and
deepen
its
participation
in
nato
just
as
we
support
strong
european
that
why
we
welcome
croatia
and
albania
into
the
fold
and
that
is
why
we
must
ensure
that
nato
is
equipped
and
capable
of
facing
down
the
threats
and
challenges
of
this
new
age
this
is
one
of
our
central
tasks
and
we
also
know
that
in
the
century
security
is
more
complex
than
military
power
this
is
the
generation
that
must
also
stop
the
spread
of
the
pollution
that
is
slowly
killing
our
planet
from
shrinking
coastlines
and
devastating
storms
to
widespread
misery
and
famine
and
drought
the
effects
of
climate
change
are
now
in
plain
sight
europe
has
acted
with
seriousness
of
purpose
that
this
challenge
demands
and
in
the
last
few
months
proud
to
say
that
america
has
begun
to
take
unprecedented
steps
to
transform
the
way
that
we
use
energy
we
appointed
special
envoy
to
help
us
lead
global
effort
to
reduce
the
carbon
that
we
send
in
the
atmosphere
but
we
all
know
that
time
is
running
out
and
that
means
that
america
must
do
more
europe
must
do
more
china
and
india
must
do
more
rolling
back
the
tide
of
warming
planet
is
responsibility
that
we
have
to
ourselves
to
our
children
and
all
of
those
who
will
inherit
god
creation
long
after
we
are
gone
so
let
us
meet
that
responsibility
together
am
confident
that
we
can
meet
it
but
we
have
to
begin
today
and
let
us
resolve
that
when
future
generations
look
back
on
ours
they
will
be
able
to
say
that
we
did
our
part
to
make
this
world
more
peaceful
it
perhaps
the
most
difficult
work
of
all
to
resolve
conflicts
to
heal
ancient
hatreds
to
dissolve
the
lines
of
suspicion
between
religions
and
cultures
and
people
who
may
not
look
like
us
or
have
the
same
faith
that
we
do
or
come
from
the
same
place
but
just
because
it
difficult
does
not
make
the
work
any
less
important
it
does
not
absolve
us
from
trying
and
to
that
end
america
will
sustain
our
effort
to
forge
and
secure
lasting
peace
between
the
israelis
and
the
sent
clear
message
to
the
leaders
and
peoples
of
iran
that
while
we
have
real
differences
we
also
have
mutual
interests
and
we
seek
new
engagement
based
on
mutual
respect
and
it
is
in
that
spirit
that
america
and
europe
must
reach
out
to
the
vast
majority
of
muslims
in
our
nations
and
in
all
nations
we
seek
only
hope
of
peace
and
partnership
and
the
opportunity
of
better
life
we
can
not
simply
solve
these
conflicts
militarily
we
have
to
open
our
minds
and
we
have
to
open
our
hearts
to
the
differences
among
us
and
the
commonalities
between
us
with
every
threat
that
we
face
new
day
is
possible
we
get
there
alone
as
it
was
in
the
darkest
days
after
world
war
when
continent
lay
in
ruins
and
an
atomic
cloud
had
settled
over
the
world
we
must
make
the
journey
together
we
know
that
transformational
change
is
possible
we
know
this
because
of
three
reasons
first
because
for
all
our
differences
there
are
certain
values
that
bind
us
together
and
reveal
our
common
humanity
the
universal
longing
to
live
life
free
from
fear
and
free
from
want
life
marked
by
dignity
and
respect
and
simple
justice
our
two
republics
were
founded
in
service
of
these
ideals
in
america
it
is
written
into
our
founding
documents
as
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
in
france
absolutely
our
moral
authority
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
generations
of
our
citizens
have
fought
and
bled
to
uphold
these
values
in
our
nations
and
others
and
that
why
we
can
never
sacrifice
them
for
expedience
sake
that
why
ordered
the
closing
of
the
detention
in
bay
that
why
can
stand
here
today
and
say
without
equivocation
or
exception
that
the
united
states
of
america
does
not
and
will
not
torture
the
second
way
that
we
can
turn
challenge
into
opportunity
is
through
our
persistence
in
the
face
of
difficulty
in
an
age
of
instant
gratification
it
tempting
to
believe
that
every
problem
can
and
should
be
solved
in
the
span
of
week
when
these
problems
are
solved
we
conclude
that
our
efforts
to
solve
them
must
have
been
in
vain
but
that
not
how
progress
is
made
progress
is
slow
it
comes
in
fits
and
starts
because
we
try
and
we
fail
and
then
we
try
something
else
and
when
there
are
setbacks
and
disappointments
we
keep
going
we
hold
firm
to
our
core
values
and
we
hold
firm
to
our
faith
in
one
another
the
third
reason
we
know
that
we
can
change
this
world
is
because
of
men
and
women
like
the
young
people
who
are
here
today
each
time
we
find
ourselves
at
crossroads
by
worn
debates
and
stale
thinking
the
old
ways
of
doing
things
new
generation
rises
up
and
shows
the
way
forward
as
kennedy
once
told
crowd
of
students
in
south
africa
it
is
revolutionary
world
that
we
live
in
and
thus
it
is
young
people
who
must
take
the
lead
because
young
people
are
unburdened
by
the
biases
or
prejudices
of
the
past
that
is
great
privilege
of
youth
but
it
also
tremendous
responsibility
because
it
is
you
who
must
ultimately
decide
what
we
do
with
this
incredible
moment
in
history
we
just
emerged
from
an
era
marked
by
irresponsibility
and
it
would
be
easy
to
choose
the
path
of
selfishness
or
apathy
of
blame
or
division
but
that
is
danger
that
we
can
not
afford
the
challenges
are
too
great
it
is
revolutionary
world
that
we
live
in
and
history
shows
us
that
we
can
do
improbable
sometimes
impossible
things
we
stand
here
in
city
that
used
to
stand
at
the
of
european
conflict
only
now
it
is
the
of
european
union
we
did
that
together
now
we
must
not
give
up
on
one
another
we
must
renew
this
relationship
for
new
generation
in
new
century
we
must
hold
firm
to
our
common
values
hold
firm
to
our
faith
in
one
another
together
confident
that
we
can
achieve
the
promise
of
new
day
thank
you

on
the
toughest
assignments

is
an
example
of
the
very
best
that
this
nation
has
to
offer
and
we
owe
him
great
debt
of
gratitude
he
carried
on
his
work
with
an
extraordinary
degree
of
cooperation
with
two
of
our
finest
generals
general
david
and
general
ray
who
will
be
critical
in
carrying
forward
the
strategy
that
will
outline
today
next
month
will
mark
the
sixth
anniversary
of
the
war
in
iraq
by
any
measure
this
has
already
been
long
war
for
the
men
and
women
of
armed
forces
and
for
your
families
this
war
has
been
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
chapters
of
service
in
the
history
of
our
nation
you
have
endured
tour
after
tour
after
tour
of
duty
you
have
known
the
dangers
of
combat
and
the
lonely
distance
of
loved
ones
you
have
fought
against
tyranny
and
disorder
you
have
bled
for
your
best
friends
and
for
unknown
iraqis
and
you
have
borne
an
enormous
burden
for
your
fellow
citizens
while
extending
precious
opportunity
to
the
people
of
iraq
under
tough
circumstances
the
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
military
have
served
with
and
succeeded
beyond
any
expectation
today
have
come
to
speak
to
you
about
how
the
war
in
iraq
will
end
to
understand
where
we
need
to
go
in
iraq
it
is
important
for
the
american
people
to
understand
where
we
now
stand
thanks
in
great
measure
to
your
service
the
situation
in
iraq
has
improved
violence
has
been
reduced
substantially
from
the
horrific
sectarian
killing
of
and
in
iraq
has
been
dealt
serious
blow
by
our
troops
and
security
forces
and
through
our
partnership
with
arabs
the
capacity
of
security
forces
has
improved
and
leaders
have
taken
steps
toward
political
accommodation
the
relative
peace
and
strong
participation
in
provincial
elections
sent
powerful
message
to
the
world
about
how
far
iraqis
have
come
in
pursuing
their
aspirations
through
peaceful
political
process
but
let
there
be
no
doubt
iraq
is
not
yet
secure
and
there
will
be
difficult
days
ahead
violence
will
continue
to
be
part
of
life
in
iraq
too
many
fundamental
political
questions
about
future
remain
unresolved
too
many
iraqis
are
still
displaced
or
destitute
declining
oil
revenues
will
put
an
added
strain
on
government
that
has
had
difficulty
delivering
basic
services
not
all
of
are
contributing
to
its
security
some
are
working
at
times
to
undermine
it
and
even
as
government
is
on
surer
footing
it
is
not
yet
full
partner
politically
and
economically
in
the
region
or
with
the
international
community
in
short
today
there
is
renewed
cause
for
hope
in
iraq
but
that
hope
rests
upon
an
emerging
foundation
on
my
first
full
day
in
office
directed
my
national
security
team
to
undertake
comprehensive
review
of
our
strategy
in
iraq
to
determine
the
best
way
to
strengthen
that
foundation
while
strengthening
american
national
security
have
listened
to
my
secretary
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
and
commanders
on
the
ground
we
have
acted
with
careful
consideration
of
events
on
the
ground
with
respect
for
the
security
agreements
between
the
united
states
and
iraq
and
with
critical
recognition
that
the
solution
in
iraq
must
be
political
not
military
because
the
most
important
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
about
future
must
now
be
made
by
iraqis
we
have
also
taken
into
account
the
simple
reality
that
america
can
no
longer
afford
to
see
iraq
in
isolation
from
other
priorities
we
face
the
challenge
of
refocusing
on
and
pakistan
of
relieving
the
burden
on
our
military
and
of
rebuilding
our
struggling
economy
and
these
are
challenges
that
we
will
meet
today
can
announce
that
our
review
is
complete
and
that
the
united
states
will
pursue
new
strategy
to
end
the
war
in
iraq
through
transition
to
full
iraqi
responsibility
this
strategy
is
grounded
in
clear
and
achievable
goal
shared
by
the
iraqi
people
and
the
american
people
an
iraq
that
is
sovereign
stable
and
to
achieve
that
goal
we
will
work
to
promote
an
iraqi
government
that
is
just
representative
and
accountable
and
that
provides
neither
support
nor
to
terrorists
we
will
help
iraq
build
new
ties
of
trade
and
commerce
with
the
world
and
we
will
forge
partnership
with
the
people
and
government
of
iraq
that
contributes
to
the
peace
and
security
of
the
region
what
we
will
not
do
is
let
the
pursuit
of
the
perfect
stand
in
the
way
of
achievable
goals
we
can
not
rid
iraq
of
all
who
oppose
america
or
with
our
adversaries
we
can
not
police
streets
until
they
are
completely
safe
nor
stay
until
union
is
perfected
we
can
not
sustain
indefinitely
commitment
that
has
put
strain
on
our
military
and
will
cost
the
american
people
nearly
trillion
dollars
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
fought
block
by
block
province
by
province
year
after
year
to
give
the
iraqis
this
chance
to
choose
better
future
now
we
must
ask
the
iraqi
people
to
seize
it
the
first
part
of
this
strategy
is
therefore
the
responsible
removal
of
our
combat
brigades
from
iraq
as
candidate
for
president
made
clear
my
support
for
of
months
to
carry
out
this
while
pledging
to
consult
closely
with
our
military
commanders
upon
taking
office
to
ensure
that
we
preserve
the
gains
made
and
protect
our
troops
those
consultations
are
now
complete
and
have
chosen
that
will
remove
our
combat
brigades
over
the
next
months
let
me
say
this
as
plainly
as
can
by
august
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
will
end
as
we
carry
out
this
my
highest
priority
will
be
the
safety
and
security
of
our
troops
and
civilians
in
iraq
we
will
proceed
carefully
and
will
consult
closely
with
my
military
commanders
on
the
ground
and
with
the
iraqi
government
there
will
surely
be
difficult
periods
and
tactical
adjustments
but
our
enemies
should
be
left
with
no
doubt
this
plan
gives
our
military
the
forces
and
the
flexibility
they
need
to
support
our
iraqi
partners
and
to
succeed
after
we
remove
our
combat
brigades
our
mission
will
change
from
combat
to
supporting
the
iraqi
government
and
its
security
forces
as
they
take
the
absolute
lead
in
securing
their
country
as
have
long
said
we
will
retain
transitional
force
to
carry
out
three
distinct
functions
training
equipping
and
advising
iraqi
security
forces
as
long
as
they
remain
conducting
targeted
missions
and
protecting
our
ongoing
civilian
and
military
efforts
within
iraq
initially
this
force
will
likely
be
made
up
of
troops
through
this
period
of
transition
we
will
carry
out
further
and
under
the
status
of
forces
agreement
with
the
iraqi
government
intend
to
remove
all
troops
from
iraq
by
the
end
of
we
will
complete
this
transition
to
iraqi
responsibility
and
we
will
bring
our
troops
home
with
the
that
they
have
earned
as
we
responsibly
remove
our
combat
brigades
we
will
pursue
the
second
part
of
our
strategy
sustained
diplomacy
on
behalf
of
more
peaceful
and
prosperous
iraq
the
of
our
military
should
send
clear
signal
that
future
is
now
its
own
responsibility
the
success
of
the
iraqi
nation
will
depend
upon
decisions
made
by
leaders
and
the
fortitude
of
the
iraqi
people
iraq
is
sovereign
country
with
legitimate
institutions
america
can
not
and
should
not
take
their
place
however
strong
political
diplomatic
and
civilian
effort
on
our
part
can
advance
progress
and
help
lay
foundation
for
lasting
peace
and
security
this
effort
will
be
led
by
our
new
ambassador
to
iraq
hill
from
his
time
in
the
peace
corps
to
his
work
in
and
korea
ambassador
hill
has
been
tested
and
he
has
shown
the
pragmatism
and
skill
that
we
need
right
now
he
will
be
supported
by
the
courageous
and
capable
work
of
so
many
american
diplomats
and
aid
workers
who
are
serving
in
iraq
going
forward
we
can
make
difference
on
several
fronts
we
will
work
with
the
united
nations
to
support
national
elections
while
helping
iraqis
improve
local
government
we
can
serve
as
an
honest
broker
in
pursuit
of
fair
and
durable
agreements
on
issues
that
have
divided
leaders
and
just
as
we
will
support
security
forces
we
will
help
iraqi
institutions
strengthen
their
capacity
to
protect
the
rule
of
law
confront
corruption
and
deliver
basic
services
diplomacy
and
assistance
is
also
required
to
help
the
millions
of
displaced
iraqis
these
men
women
and
children
are
living
consequence
of
this
war
and
challenge
to
stability
in
the
region
and
they
must
become
part
of
reconciliation
and
recovery
america
has
strategic
interest
and
moral
responsibility
to
act
in
the
coming
months
my
administration
will
provide
more
assistance
and
take
steps
to
increase
international
support
for
countries
already
hosting
refugees
cooperate
with
others
to
resettle
iraqis
facing
great
personal
risk
and
we
will
work
with
the
iraqi
government
over
time
to
resettle
refugees
and
displaced
iraqis
within
iraq
because
there
are
few
more
powerful
indicators
of
lasting
peace
than
displaced
citizens
returning
home
now
before
go
any
further
want
to
take
moment
to
speak
directly
to
the
people
of
iraq
you
are
great
nation
rooted
in
the
cradle
of
you
are
joined
together
by
enduring
accomplishments
and
history
that
connects
you
as
surely
as
the
two
rivers
carved
into
your
land
in
years
past
you
have
persevered
through
tyranny
and
terror
through
personal
insecurity
and
sectarian
violence
and
instead
of
giving
in
to
the
forces
of
disunion
you
stepped
back
from
descent
into
civil
war
and
showed
proud
resilience
that
deserves
respect
our
nations
have
known
difficult
times
together
but
ours
is
bond
forged
by
shared
bloodshed
and
countless
friendships
among
our
people
we
americans
have
offered
our
most
precious
resource
our
young
men
and
women
to
work
with
you
to
rebuild
what
was
destroyed
by
despotism
to
root
out
our
common
enemies
and
to
seek
peace
and
prosperity
for
our
children
and
grandchildren
and
for
yours
there
are
those
who
will
try
to
prevent
that
future
for
iraq
who
will
insist
that
differences
can
not
be
reconciled
without
more
killing
they
represent
the
forces
that
destroy
nations
and
lead
only
to
despair
and
they
will
test
our
will
in
the
months
and
years
to
come
america
too
has
known
these
forces
we
endured
the
pain
of
civil
war
and
bitter
divisions
of
region
and
race
but
hostility
and
hatred
are
no
match
for
justice
they
offer
no
pathway
to
peace
and
they
must
not
stand
between
the
people
of
iraq
and
future
of
reconciliation
and
hope
so
to
the
iraqi
people
let
me
be
clear
about
intentions
the
united
states
pursues
no
claim
on
your
territory
or
your
resources
we
respect
your
sovereignty
and
the
tremendous
sacrifices
you
have
made
for
your
country
we
seek
full
transition
to
iraqi
responsibility
for
the
security
of
your
country
and
going
forward
we
can
build
lasting
relationship
founded
upon
mutual
interests
and
mutual
respect
as
iraq
takes
its
rightful
place
in
the
community
of
nations
that
leads
me
to
the
third
part
of
our
strategy
comprehensive
american
engagement
across
the
region
the
future
of
iraq
is
inseparable
from
the
future
of
the
broader
middle
east
so
we
must
work
with
our
friends
and
partners
to
establish
new
framework
that
advances
security
and
the
it
is
time
for
iraq
to
be
full
partner
in
regional
dialogue
and
for
to
establish
productive
and
relations
with
iraq
and
going
forward
the
united
states
will
pursue
principled
and
sustained
engagement
with
all
of
the
nations
in
the
region
and
that
will
include
iran
and
syria
this
reflects
fundamental
truth
we
can
no
longer
deal
with
regional
challenges
in
isolation
we
need
smarter
more
sustainable
and
comprehensive
approach
that
is
why
we
are
renewing
our
diplomacy
while
relieving
the
burden
on
our
military
that
is
why
we
are
refocusing
on
in
and
pakistan
developing
strategy
to
use
all
elements
of
american
power
to
prevent
iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapon
and
actively
seeking
lasting
peace
between
israel
and
the
arab
world
and
that
is
why
we
have
named
three
of
most
accomplished
diplomats
george
and
to
support
secretary
and
me
as
we
carry
forward
this
agenda
every
nation
and
every
group
must
know
whether
you
wish
america
good
or
ill
that
the
end
of
the
war
in
iraq
will
enable
new
era
of
american
leadership
and
engagement
in
the
middle
east
and
that
era
has
just
begun
finally
want
to
be
very
clear
that
my
strategy
for
ending
the
war
in
iraq
does
not
end
with
military
plans
or
diplomatic
agendas
it
endures
through
our
commitment
to
uphold
our
sacred
trust
with
every
man
and
woman
who
has
served
in
iraq
you
make
up
fraction
of
the
american
population
but
in
an
age
when
so
many
people
and
institutions
have
acted
irresponsibly
you
did
the
opposite
you
volunteered
to
bear
the
heaviest
burden
and
for
you
and
for
your
families
the
war
does
not
end
when
you
come
home
it
lives
on
in
memories
of
your
fellow
soldiers
sailors
airmen
and
marines
who
gave
their
lives
it
endures
in
the
wound
that
is
slow
to
heal
the
disability
that
going
away
the
dream
that
wakes
you
at
night
or
the
stiffening
in
your
spine
when
car
backfires
down
the
street
you
and
your
families
have
done
your
duty
now
grateful
nation
must
do
ours
that
is
why
am
increasing
the
number
of
soldiers
and
marines
so
that
we
lessen
the
burden
on
those
who
are
serving
and
that
is
why
have
committed
to
expanding
our
system
of
veterans
health
care
to
serve
more
patients
and
to
provide
better
care
in
more
places
we
will
continue
building
new
wounded
warrior
facilities
across
america
and
invest
in
new
ways
of
identifying
and
treating
the
signature
wounds
of
this
war
stress
disorder
and
traumatic
brain
injury
as
well
as
other
combat
injuries
we
also
know
that
service
does
not
end
with
the
person
wearing
the
uniform
in
her
visits
with
military
families
across
the
country
my
wife
has
learned
firsthand
about
the
unique
burden
that
your
families
endure
every
day
want
you
to
know
this
military
families
are
top
priority
for
and
me
and
they
will
be
top
priority
for
my
administration
raise
military
pay
and
continue
providing
quality
for
spouses
and
expanded
and
outreach
to
families
that
have
known
the
separation
and
stress
of
war
we
will
also
heed
the
lesson
of
history
that
those
who
fight
in
battle
can
form
the
backbone
of
our
middle
class
by
implementing
century
bill
to
help
our
veterans
live
their
dreams
as
nation
we
have
had
our
share
of
debates
about
the
war
in
iraq
it
has
at
times
divided
us
as
people
to
this
very
day
there
are
some
americans
who
want
to
stay
in
iraq
longer
and
some
who
want
to
leave
faster
but
there
should
be
no
disagreement
on
what
the
men
and
women
of
our
military
have
achieved
and
so
want
to
be
very
clear
we
sent
our
troops
to
iraq
to
do
away
with
regime
and
you
got
the
job
done
we
kept
our
troops
in
iraq
to
help
establish
sovereign
government
and
you
got
the
job
done
and
we
will
leave
the
iraqi
people
with
opportunity
to
live
better
life
that
is
your
achievement
that
is
the
prospect
that
you
have
made
possible
there
are
many
lessons
to
be
learned
from
what
experienced
we
have
learned
that
america
must
go
to
war
with
clearly
defined
goals
which
is
why
ordered
review
of
our
policy
in
we
have
learned
that
we
must
always
weigh
the
costs
of
action
and
communicate
those
costs
candidly
to
the
american
people
which
is
why
put
iraq
and
into
my
budget
we
have
learned
that
in
the
century
we
must
use
all
elements
of
american
power
to
achieve
our
objectives
which
is
why
am
committed
to
building
our
civilian
national
security
capacity
so
that
the
burden
is
not
continually
pushed
on
to
our
military
we
have
learned
that
our
political
leaders
must
pursue
the
broad
and
bipartisan
support
that
our
national
security
policies
depend
upon
which
is
why
will
consult
with
congress
and
in
carrying
out
my
plans
and
we
have
learned
the
importance
of
working
closely
with
friends
and
allies
which
is
why
we
are
launching
new
era
of
engagement
in
the
world
the
starting
point
for
our
policies
must
always
be
the
safety
of
the
american
people
know
that
you
the
men
and
women
of
the
finest
fighting
force
in
the
history
of
the
world
can
meet
any
challenge
and
defeat
any
foe
and
as
long
as
am
your
promise
you
that
will
only
send
you
into
way
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
and
provide
you
with
the
equipment
and
support
you
need
to
get
the
job
done
that
is
the
most
important
lesson
of
all
for
the
consequences
of
war
are
dire
the
sacrifices
immeasurable
you
know
because
you
have
seen
those
sacrifices
you
have
lived
them
and
we
all
them
it
means
always
being
faithful
to
corps
and
to
country
and
to
the
memory
of
fallen
comrades
like
corporal
jonathan
yale
and
lance
corporal
these
young
men
enlisted
in
time
of
war
knowing
they
would
face
great
danger
they
came
here
to
camp
as
they
trained
for
their
mission
and
last
april
they
were
standing
guard
in
in
an
age
when
suicide
is
weapon
they
were
suddenly
faced
with
an
truck
filled
with
explosives
these
two
marines
stood
their
ground
these
two
marines
opened
fire
and
these
two
marines
stopped
that
truck
when
the
thousands
of
pounds
of
explosives
detonated
they
had
saved
fifty
marines
and
iraqi
police
who
would
have
been
in
the
path
but
corporal
yale
and
lance
corporal
lost
their
own
lives
jonathan
was
was
in
the
town
where
was
from
bridge
was
dedicated
in
his
name
one
marine
who
to
the
ceremony
said
we
flew
here
from
all
over
the
country
to
pay
tribute
to
our
friend
who
risked
his
life
to
save
us
we
be
here
without
him
time
in
iraq
is
filled
with
stories
of
men
and
women
like
this
their
names
are
written
into
bridges
and
town
squares
they
are
etched
into
stones
at
and
in
quiet
places
of
rest
across
our
land
they
are
spoken
in
schools
and
on
city
blocks
they
live
on
in
the
memories
of
those
who
wear
your
uniform
in
the
hearts
of
those
they
loved
and
in
the
freedom
of
the
nation
they
served
each
american
who
has
served
in
iraq
has
their
own
story
each
of
you
has
your
own
story
and
that
story
is
now
part
of
the
history
of
the
united
states
of
america
nation
that
exists
only
because
free
men
and
women
have
bled
for
it
from
the
beaches
of
normandy
to
the
deserts
of
from
the
mountains
of
korea
to
the
streets
of
you
teach
us
that
the
price
of
freedom
is
great
your
sacrifice
should
challenge
all
of
us
every
single
american
to
ask
what
we
can
do
to
be
better
citizens
there
will
be
more
danger
in
the
months
ahead
we
will
face
new
tests
and
unforeseen
trials
but
thanks
to
the
sacrifices
of
those
who
have
served
we
have
forged
progress
we
are
leaving
iraq
to
its
people
and
we
have
begun
the
work
of
ending
this
war
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
madame
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
the
first
lady
of
the
united
states
who
is
around
here
somewhere
have
come
here
tonight
not
only
to
address
the
distinguished
men
and
women
in
this
great
chamber
but
to
speak
frankly
and
directly
to
the
men
and
women
who
sent
us
here
know
that
for
many
americans
watching
right
now
the
state
of
our
economy
is
concern
that
rises
above
all
others
and
rightly
so
if
you
been
personally
affected
by
this
recession
you
probably
know
someone
who
has
friend
member
of
your
family
you
need
to
hear
another
list
of
statistics
to
know
that
our
economy
is
in
crisis
because
you
live
it
every
day
the
worry
you
wake
up
with
and
the
source
of
sleepless
nights
the
job
you
thought
retire
from
but
now
have
lost
the
business
you
built
your
dreams
upon
now
hanging
by
thread
the
college
acceptance
letter
your
child
had
to
put
back
in
the
envelope
the
impact
of
this
recession
is
real
and
it
is
everywhere
but
while
our
economy
may
be
weakened
and
our
confidence
shaken
though
we
are
living
through
difficult
and
uncertain
times
tonight
want
every
american
to
know
this
we
will
rebuild
we
will
recover
and
the
united
states
of
america
will
emerge
stronger
than
before
the
weight
of
this
crisis
will
not
determine
the
destiny
of
this
nation
the
answers
to
our
problems
lie
beyond
our
reach
they
exist
in
our
laboratories
and
universities
in
our
fields
and
our
factories
in
the
imaginations
of
our
entrepreneurs
and
the
pride
of
the
people
on
earth
those
qualities
that
have
made
america
the
greatest
force
of
progress
and
prosperity
in
human
history
we
still
possess
in
ample
measure
what
is
required
now
is
for
this
country
to
pull
together
confront
boldly
the
challenges
we
face
and
take
responsibility
for
our
future
once
more
now
if
honest
with
ourselves
admit
that
for
too
long
we
have
not
always
met
these
responsibilities
as
government
or
as
people
say
this
not
to
lay
blame
or
look
backwards
but
because
it
is
only
by
understanding
how
we
arrived
at
this
moment
that
be
able
to
lift
ourselves
out
of
this
predicament
the
fact
is
our
economy
did
not
fall
into
decline
overnight
nor
did
all
of
our
problems
begin
when
the
housing
market
collapsed
or
the
stock
market
sank
we
have
known
for
decades
that
our
survival
depends
on
finding
new
sources
of
energy
yet
we
import
more
oil
today
than
ever
before
the
cost
of
health
care
eats
up
more
and
more
of
our
savings
each
year
yet
we
keep
delaying
reform
our
children
will
compete
for
jobs
in
global
economy
that
too
many
of
our
schools
do
not
prepare
them
for
and
though
all
these
challenges
went
unsolved
we
still
managed
to
spend
more
money
and
pile
up
more
debt
both
as
individuals
and
through
our
government
than
ever
before
in
other
words
we
have
lived
through
an
era
where
too
often
gains
were
prized
over
prosperity
where
we
failed
to
look
beyond
the
next
payment
the
next
quarter
or
the
next
election
surplus
became
an
excuse
to
transfer
wealth
to
the
wealthy
instead
of
an
opportunity
to
invest
in
our
future
regulations
were
gutted
for
the
sake
of
quick
profit
at
the
expense
of
healthy
market
people
bought
homes
they
knew
they
afford
from
banks
and
lenders
who
pushed
those
bad
loans
anyway
and
all
the
while
critical
debates
and
difficult
decisions
were
put
off
for
some
other
time
on
some
other
day
well
that
day
of
reckoning
has
arrived
and
the
time
to
take
charge
of
our
future
is
here
now
is
the
time
to
act
boldly
and
wisely
to
not
only
revive
this
economy
but
to
build
new
foundation
for
lasting
prosperity
now
is
the
time
to
jumpstart
job
creation
lending
and
invest
in
areas
like
energy
health
care
and
education
that
will
grow
our
economy
even
as
we
make
hard
choices
to
bring
our
deficit
down
that
is
what
my
economic
agenda
is
designed
to
do
and
what
like
to
talk
to
you
about
tonight
an
agenda
that
begins
with
jobs
as
soon
as
took
office
asked
this
congress
to
send
me
recovery
plan
by
day
that
would
put
people
back
to
work
and
put
money
in
their
pockets
not
because
believe
in
bigger
government
not
because
not
mindful
of
the
massive
debt
inherited
am
called
for
action
because
the
failure
to
do
so
would
have
cost
more
jobs
and
caused
more
hardships
in
fact
failure
to
act
would
have
worsened
our
deficit
by
assuring
weak
economic
growth
for
years
why
pushed
for
quick
action
and
tonight
am
grateful
that
this
congress
delivered
and
pleased
to
say
that
the
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
act
is
now
law
over
the
next
two
years
this
plan
will
save
or
create
million
jobs
more
than
of
these
jobs
will
be
in
the
private
sector
jobs
rebuilding
our
roads
and
bridges
constructing
wind
turbines
and
solar
panels
laying
broadband
and
expanding
mass
transit
because
of
this
plan
there
are
teachers
who
can
now
keep
their
jobs
and
educate
our
kids
health
care
professionals
can
continue
caring
for
our
sick
there
are
police
officers
who
are
still
on
the
streets
of
tonight
because
this
plan
prevented
the
layoffs
their
department
was
about
to
make
because
of
this
plan
of
the
working
households
in
america
will
receive
tax
cut
tax
cut
that
you
will
see
in
your
beginning
on
april
because
of
this
plan
families
who
are
struggling
to
pay
tuition
costs
will
receive
tax
credit
for
all
four
years
of
college
and
americans
who
have
lost
their
jobs
in
this
recession
will
be
able
to
receive
extended
unemployment
benefits
and
continued
health
care
coverage
to
help
them
weather
this
storm
know
there
are
some
in
this
chamber
and
watching
at
home
who
are
of
whether
this
plan
will
work
understand
that
here
in
washington
all
seen
how
quickly
good
intentions
can
turn
into
broken
promises
and
wasteful
spending
and
with
plan
of
this
scale
comes
enormous
responsibility
to
get
it
right
that
is
why
have
asked
vice
president
to
lead
tough
unprecedented
oversight
effort
because
nobody
messes
with
have
told
each
member
of
my
cabinet
as
well
as
mayors
and
governors
across
the
country
that
they
will
be
held
accountable
by
me
and
the
american
people
for
every
dollar
they
spend
have
appointed
proven
and
aggressive
inspector
general
to
ferret
out
any
and
all
cases
of
waste
and
fraud
and
we
have
created
new
website
called
so
that
every
american
can
find
out
how
and
where
their
money
is
being
spent
so
the
recovery
plan
we
passed
is
the
first
step
in
getting
our
economy
back
on
track
but
it
is
just
the
first
step
because
even
if
we
manage
this
plan
flawlessly
there
will
be
no
real
recovery
unless
we
clean
up
the
credit
crisis
that
has
severely
weakened
our
financial
system
want
to
speak
plainly
and
candidly
about
this
issue
tonight
because
every
american
should
know
that
it
directly
affects
you
and
your
you
should
also
know
that
the
money
deposited
in
banks
across
the
country
is
safe
your
insurance
is
secure
and
you
can
rely
on
the
continued
operation
of
our
financial
system
that
is
not
the
source
of
concern
the
concern
is
that
if
we
do
not
lending
in
this
country
our
recovery
will
be
choked
off
before
it
even
begins
you
see
the
flow
of
credit
is
the
lifeblood
of
our
economy
the
ability
to
get
loan
is
how
you
finance
the
purchase
of
everything
from
home
to
car
to
college
education
how
stores
stock
their
shelves
farms
buy
equipment
and
businesses
make
payroll
but
credit
has
stopped
flowing
the
way
it
should
too
many
bad
loans
from
the
housing
crisis
have
made
their
way
onto
the
books
of
too
many
banks
with
so
much
debt
and
so
little
confidence
these
banks
are
now
fearful
of
lending
out
any
more
money
to
households
to
businesses
or
to
each
other
when
there
is
no
lending
families
afford
to
buy
homes
or
cars
so
businesses
are
forced
to
make
layoffs
our
economy
suffers
even
more
and
credit
dries
up
even
further
that
is
why
this
administration
is
moving
swiftly
and
aggressively
to
break
this
destructive
cycle
restore
confidence
and
lending
we
will
do
so
in
several
ways
first
we
are
creating
new
lending
fund
that
represents
the
largest
effort
ever
to
help
provide
auto
loans
college
loans
and
small
business
loans
to
the
consumers
and
entrepreneurs
who
keep
this
economy
running
second
we
have
launched
housing
plan
that
will
help
responsible
families
facing
the
threat
of
foreclosure
lower
their
monthly
payments
and
their
mortgages
plan
that
help
speculators
or
that
down
the
street
who
bought
house
he
could
never
hope
to
afford
but
it
will
help
millions
of
americans
who
are
struggling
with
declining
home
values
americans
who
will
now
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
lower
interest
rates
that
this
plan
has
already
helped
bring
about
in
fact
the
average
family
who
today
can
save
nearly
per
year
on
their
mortgage
third
we
will
act
with
the
full
force
of
the
federal
government
to
ensure
that
the
major
banks
that
americans
depend
on
have
enough
confidence
and
enough
money
to
lend
even
in
more
difficult
times
and
when
we
learn
that
major
bank
has
serious
problems
we
will
hold
accountable
those
responsible
force
the
necessary
adjustments
provide
the
support
to
clean
up
their
balance
sheets
and
assure
the
continuity
of
strong
viable
institution
that
can
serve
our
people
and
our
economy
understand
that
on
any
given
day
wall
street
may
be
more
comforted
by
an
approach
that
gives
banks
with
no
strings
attached
and
that
holds
nobody
accountable
for
their
reckless
decisions
but
such
an
approach
solve
the
problem
and
our
goal
is
to
quicken
the
day
when
we
lending
to
the
american
people
and
american
business
and
end
this
crisis
once
and
for
all
intend
to
hold
these
banks
fully
accountable
for
the
assistance
they
receive
and
this
time
they
will
have
to
clearly
demonstrate
how
taxpayer
dollars
result
in
more
lending
for
the
american
taxpayer
this
time
be
able
to
use
taxpayer
money
to
pad
their
or
buy
fancy
drapes
or
disappear
on
private
jet
those
days
are
over
still
this
plan
will
require
significant
resources
from
the
federal
government
and
yes
probably
more
than
already
set
aside
but
while
the
cost
of
action
will
be
great
can
assure
you
that
the
cost
of
inaction
will
be
far
greater
for
it
could
result
in
an
economy
that
along
for
not
months
or
years
but
perhaps
decade
that
would
be
worse
for
our
deficit
worse
for
business
worse
for
you
and
worse
for
the
next
generation
and
refuse
to
let
that
happen
understand
that
when
the
last
administration
asked
this
congress
to
provide
assistance
for
struggling
banks
democrats
and
republicans
alike
were
infuriated
by
the
mismanagement
and
results
that
followed
so
were
the
american
taxpayers
so
was
so
know
how
unpopular
it
is
to
be
seen
as
helping
banks
right
now
especially
when
everyone
is
suffering
in
part
from
their
bad
decisions
promise
you
get
it
but
also
know
that
in
time
of
crisis
we
can
not
afford
to
govern
out
of
anger
or
yield
to
the
politics
of
the
moment
my
job
our
job
is
to
solve
the
problem
our
job
is
to
govern
with
sense
of
responsibility
will
not
spend
single
penny
for
the
purpose
of
rewarding
single
wall
street
executive
but
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
help
the
small
business
that
pay
its
workers
or
the
family
that
has
saved
and
still
get
mortgage
what
this
is
about
not
about
helping
banks
about
helping
people
because
when
credit
is
available
again
that
young
family
can
finally
buy
new
home
and
then
some
company
will
hire
workers
to
build
it
and
then
those
workers
will
have
money
to
spend
and
if
they
can
get
loan
too
maybe
finally
buy
that
car
or
open
their
own
business
investors
will
return
to
the
market
and
american
families
will
see
their
retirement
secured
once
more
slowly
but
surely
confidence
will
return
and
our
economy
will
recover
so
ask
this
congress
to
join
me
in
doing
whatever
proves
necessary
because
we
can
not
consign
our
nation
to
an
recession
and
to
ensure
that
crisis
of
this
magnitude
never
happens
again
ask
congress
to
move
quickly
on
legislation
that
will
finally
reform
our
outdated
regulatory
system
it
is
time
to
put
in
place
tough
new
rules
of
the
road
so
that
our
financial
market
rewards
drive
and
innovation
and
punishes
and
abuse
the
recovery
plan
and
the
financial
stability
plan
are
the
immediate
steps
taking
to
revive
our
economy
in
the
but
the
only
way
to
fully
restore
economic
strength
is
to
make
the
investments
that
will
lead
to
new
jobs
new
industries
and
renewed
ability
to
compete
with
the
rest
of
the
world
the
only
way
this
century
will
be
another
american
century
is
if
we
confront
at
last
the
price
of
our
dependence
on
oil
and
the
high
cost
of
health
care
the
schools
that
preparing
our
children
and
the
mountain
of
debt
they
stand
to
inherit
that
is
our
responsibility
in
the
next
few
days
will
submit
budget
to
congress
so
often
we
have
come
to
view
these
documents
as
simply
numbers
on
page
or
laundry
lists
of
programs
see
this
document
differently
see
it
as
vision
for
america
as
blueprint
for
our
future
my
budget
does
not
attempt
to
solve
every
problem
or
address
every
issue
it
reflects
the
stark
reality
of
what
inherited
trillion
dollar
deficit
financial
crisis
and
costly
recession
given
these
realities
everyone
in
this
chamber
democrats
and
republicans
will
have
to
sacrifice
some
worthy
priorities
for
which
there
are
no
dollars
and
that
includes
me
but
that
does
not
mean
we
can
afford
to
ignore
our
challenges
reject
the
view
that
says
our
problems
will
simply
take
care
of
themselves
that
says
government
has
no
role
in
laying
the
foundation
for
our
common
prosperity
for
history
tells
different
story
history
reminds
us
that
at
every
moment
of
economic
upheaval
and
transformation
this
nation
has
responded
with
bold
action
and
big
ideas
in
the
midst
of
civil
war
we
laid
railroad
tracks
from
one
coast
to
another
that
spurred
commerce
and
industry
from
the
turmoil
of
the
industrial
revolution
came
system
of
public
high
schools
that
prepared
our
citizens
for
new
age
in
the
wake
of
war
and
depression
the
bill
sent
generation
to
college
and
created
the
largest
in
history
and
twilight
struggle
for
freedom
led
to
nation
of
highways
an
american
on
the
moon
and
an
explosion
of
technology
that
still
shapes
our
world
in
each
case
government
supplant
private
enterprise
it
private
enterprise
it
created
the
conditions
for
thousands
of
entrepreneurs
and
new
businesses
to
adapt
and
to
thrive
we
are
nation
that
has
seen
promise
amid
peril
and
claimed
opportunity
from
ordeal
now
we
must
be
that
nation
again
that
is
why
even
as
it
cuts
back
on
the
programs
we
need
the
budget
submit
will
invest
in
the
three
areas
that
are
absolutely
critical
to
our
economic
future
energy
health
care
and
education
it
begins
with
energy
we
know
the
country
that
harnesses
the
power
of
clean
renewable
energy
will
lead
the
century
and
yet
it
is
china
that
has
launched
the
largest
effort
in
history
to
make
their
economy
energy
efficient
we
invented
solar
technology
but
fallen
behind
countries
like
germany
and
japan
in
producing
it
new
hybrids
roll
off
our
assembly
lines
but
they
will
run
on
batteries
made
in
korea
well
do
not
accept
future
where
the
jobs
and
industries
of
tomorrow
take
root
beyond
our
borders
and
know
you
either
it
is
time
for
america
to
lead
again
thanks
to
our
recovery
plan
we
will
double
this
supply
of
renewable
energy
in
the
next
three
years
we
have
also
made
the
largest
investment
in
basic
research
funding
in
american
history
an
investment
that
will
spur
not
only
new
discoveries
in
energy
but
breakthroughs
in
medicine
science
and
technology
we
will
soon
lay
down
thousands
of
miles
of
power
lines
that
can
carry
new
energy
to
cities
and
towns
across
this
country
and
we
will
put
americans
to
work
making
our
homes
and
buildings
more
efficient
so
that
we
can
save
billions
of
dollars
on
our
energy
bills
but
to
truly
transform
our
economy
protect
our
security
and
save
our
planet
from
the
ravages
of
climate
change
we
need
to
ultimately
make
clean
renewable
energy
the
profitable
kind
of
energy
so
ask
this
congress
to
send
me
legislation
that
places
cap
on
carbon
pollution
and
drives
the
production
of
more
renewable
energy
in
america
and
to
support
that
innovation
we
will
invest
fifteen
billion
dollars
year
to
develop
technologies
like
wind
power
and
solar
power
advanced
clean
coal
and
more
cars
and
trucks
built
right
here
in
america
as
for
our
auto
industry
everyone
that
years
of
bad
and
global
recession
have
pushed
our
to
the
brink
we
should
not
and
will
not
protect
them
from
their
own
bad
practices
but
we
are
committed
to
the
goal
of
auto
industry
that
can
compete
and
win
millions
of
jobs
depend
on
it
scores
of
communities
depend
on
it
and
believe
the
nation
that
invented
the
automobile
can
not
walk
away
from
it
none
of
this
will
come
without
cost
nor
will
it
be
easy
but
this
is
america
we
do
easy
we
do
what
is
necessary
to
move
this
country
forward
for
that
same
reason
we
must
also
address
the
crushing
cost
of
health
care
this
is
cost
that
now
causes
bankruptcy
in
america
every
thirty
seconds
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
could
cause
million
americans
to
lose
their
homes
in
the
last
eight
years
premiums
have
grown
four
times
faster
than
wages
and
in
each
of
these
years
one
million
more
americans
have
lost
their
health
insurance
it
is
one
of
the
major
reasons
why
small
businesses
close
their
doors
and
corporations
ship
jobs
overseas
and
one
of
the
largest
and
parts
of
our
budget
given
these
facts
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
put
health
care
reform
on
hold
already
we
have
done
more
to
advance
the
cause
of
health
care
reform
in
the
last
thirty
days
than
we
have
in
the
last
decade
when
it
was
days
old
this
congress
passed
law
to
provide
and
protect
health
insurance
for
eleven
million
american
children
whose
parents
work
our
recovery
plan
will
invest
in
electronic
health
records
and
new
technology
that
will
reduce
errors
bring
down
costs
ensure
privacy
and
save
lives
it
will
launch
new
effort
to
conquer
disease
that
has
touched
the
life
of
nearly
every
american
by
seeking
cure
for
cancer
in
our
time
and
it
makes
the
largest
investment
ever
in
preventive
care
because
that
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
keep
our
people
healthy
and
our
costs
under
control
this
budget
builds
on
these
reforms
it
includes
an
historic
commitment
to
comprehensive
health
care
reform
on
the
principle
that
we
must
have
quality
affordable
health
care
for
every
american
commitment
paid
for
in
part
by
efficiencies
in
our
system
that
are
long
overdue
and
step
we
must
take
if
we
hope
to
bring
down
our
deficit
in
the
years
to
come
now
there
will
be
many
different
opinions
and
ideas
about
how
to
achieve
reform
and
that
is
why
bringing
together
businesses
and
workers
doctors
and
health
care
providers
democrats
and
republicans
to
begin
work
on
this
issue
next
week
suffer
no
illusions
that
this
will
be
an
easy
process
it
will
be
hard
but
also
know
that
nearly
century
after
teddy
first
called
for
reform
the
cost
of
our
health
care
has
weighed
down
our
economy
and
the
conscience
of
our
nation
long
enough
so
let
there
be
no
doubt
health
care
reform
can
not
wait
it
must
not
wait
and
it
will
not
wait
another
year
the
third
challenge
we
must
address
is
the
urgent
need
to
expand
the
promise
of
education
in
america
in
global
economy
where
the
most
valuable
skill
you
can
sell
is
your
knowledge
good
education
is
no
longer
just
pathway
to
opportunity
it
is
right
now
of
the
occupations
require
more
than
high
school
diploma
and
yet
just
over
half
of
our
citizens
have
that
level
of
education
we
have
one
of
the
highest
high
school
dropout
rates
of
any
nation
and
half
of
the
students
who
begin
college
never
finish
this
is
prescription
for
economic
decline
because
we
know
the
countries
that
us
today
will
us
tomorrow
that
is
why
it
will
be
the
goal
of
this
administration
to
ensure
that
every
child
has
access
to
complete
and
competitive
education
from
the
day
they
are
born
to
the
day
they
begin
career
already
we
have
made
an
historic
investment
in
education
through
the
economic
recovery
plan
we
have
dramatically
expanded
early
childhood
education
and
will
continue
to
improve
its
quality
because
we
know
that
the
most
formative
learning
comes
in
those
first
years
of
life
we
have
made
college
affordable
for
nearly
seven
million
more
students
and
we
have
provided
the
resources
necessary
to
prevent
painful
cuts
and
teacher
layoffs
that
would
set
back
our
progress
but
we
know
that
our
schools
just
need
more
resources
they
need
more
reform
that
is
why
this
budget
creates
new
incentives
for
teacher
performance
pathways
for
advancement
and
rewards
for
success
invest
in
innovative
programs
that
are
already
helping
schools
meet
high
standards
and
close
achievement
gaps
and
we
will
expand
our
commitment
to
charter
schools
it
is
our
responsibility
as
lawmakers
and
educators
to
make
this
system
work
but
it
is
the
responsibility
of
every
citizen
to
participate
in
it
and
so
tonight
ask
every
american
to
commit
to
at
least
one
year
or
more
of
higher
education
or
career
training
this
can
be
community
college
or
school
vocational
training
or
an
apprenticeship
but
whatever
the
training
may
be
every
american
will
need
to
get
more
than
high
school
diploma
and
dropping
out
of
high
school
is
no
longer
an
option
not
just
quitting
on
yourself
quitting
on
your
country
and
this
country
needs
and
values
the
talents
of
every
american
that
is
why
we
will
provide
the
support
necessary
for
you
to
complete
college
and
meet
new
goal
by
america
will
once
again
have
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
know
that
the
price
of
tuition
is
higher
than
ever
which
is
why
if
you
are
willing
to
volunteer
in
your
or
give
back
to
your
community
or
serve
your
country
we
will
make
sure
that
you
can
afford
higher
education
and
to
encourage
renewed
spirit
of
national
service
for
this
and
future
generations
ask
this
congress
to
send
me
the
bipartisan
legislation
that
bears
the
name
of
senator
hatch
as
well
as
an
american
who
has
never
stopped
asking
what
he
can
do
for
his
country
senator
kennedy
these
education
policies
will
open
the
doors
of
opportunity
for
our
children
but
it
is
up
to
us
to
ensure
they
walk
through
them
in
the
end
there
is
no
program
or
policy
that
can
substitute
for
mother
or
father
who
will
attend
those
conferences
or
help
with
homework
after
dinner
or
turn
off
the
put
away
the
video
games
and
read
to
their
child
speak
to
you
not
just
as
president
but
as
father
when
say
that
responsibility
for
our
children
education
must
begin
at
home
there
is
of
course
another
responsibility
we
have
to
our
children
and
that
is
the
responsibility
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
pass
on
to
them
debt
they
can
not
pay
with
the
deficit
we
inherited
the
cost
of
the
crisis
we
face
and
the
challenges
we
must
meet
it
has
never
been
more
important
to
ensure
that
as
our
economy
recovers
we
do
what
it
takes
to
bring
this
deficit
down
proud
that
we
passed
the
recovery
plan
free
of
and
want
to
pass
budget
next
year
that
ensures
that
each
dollar
we
spend
reflects
only
our
most
important
national
priorities
yesterday
held
fiscal
summit
where
pledged
to
cut
the
deficit
in
half
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
in
office
my
administration
has
also
begun
to
go
line
by
line
through
the
federal
budget
in
order
to
eliminate
wasteful
and
ineffective
programs
as
you
can
imagine
this
is
process
that
will
take
some
time
but
starting
with
the
biggest
lines
we
have
already
identified
two
trillion
dollars
in
savings
over
the
next
decade
in
this
budget
we
will
end
education
programs
that
work
and
end
direct
payments
to
large
that
need
them
eliminate
the
contracts
that
have
wasted
billions
in
iraq
and
reform
our
budget
so
that
not
paying
for
cold
weapons
systems
we
use
we
will
root
out
the
waste
fraud
and
abuse
in
our
program
that
make
our
seniors
any
healthier
and
we
will
restore
sense
of
fairness
and
balance
to
our
tax
code
by
finally
ending
the
tax
breaks
for
corporations
that
ship
our
jobs
overseas
in
order
to
save
our
children
from
future
of
debt
we
will
also
end
the
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthiest
of
americans
but
let
me
perfectly
clear
because
know
hear
the
same
old
claims
that
rolling
back
these
tax
breaks
means
massive
tax
increase
on
the
american
people
if
your
family
earns
less
than
year
you
will
not
see
your
taxes
increased
single
dime
repeat
not
one
single
dime
in
fact
the
recovery
plan
provides
tax
cut
right
tax
cut
for
of
working
families
and
these
checks
are
on
the
way
to
preserve
our
fiscal
health
we
must
also
address
the
growing
costs
in
and
social
security
comprehensive
health
care
reform
is
the
best
way
to
strengthen
for
years
to
come
and
we
must
also
begin
conversation
on
how
to
do
the
same
for
social
security
while
creating
universal
savings
accounts
for
all
americans
finally
because
also
suffering
from
deficit
of
trust
am
committed
to
restoring
sense
of
honesty
and
accountability
to
our
budget
that
is
why
this
budget
looks
ahead
ten
years
and
accounts
for
spending
that
was
left
out
under
the
old
rules
and
for
the
first
time
that
includes
the
full
cost
of
fighting
in
iraq
and
for
seven
years
we
have
been
nation
at
war
no
longer
will
we
hide
its
price
we
are
now
carefully
reviewing
our
policies
in
both
wars
and
will
soon
announce
way
forward
in
iraq
that
leaves
iraq
to
its
people
and
responsibly
ends
this
war
and
with
our
friends
and
allies
we
will
forge
new
and
comprehensive
strategy
for
and
pakistan
to
defeat
and
combat
extremism
because
will
not
allow
terrorists
to
plot
against
the
american
people
from
safe
havens
half
world
away
as
we
meet
here
tonight
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
stand
watch
abroad
and
more
are
readying
to
deploy
to
each
and
every
one
of
them
and
to
the
families
who
bear
the
quiet
burden
of
their
absence
americans
are
united
in
sending
one
message
we
your
service
we
are
inspired
by
your
sacrifice
and
you
have
our
unyielding
support
to
relieve
the
strain
on
our
forces
my
budget
increases
the
number
of
our
soldiers
and
marines
and
to
keep
our
sacred
trust
with
those
who
serve
we
will
raise
their
pay
and
give
our
veterans
the
expanded
health
care
and
benefits
that
they
have
earned
to
overcome
extremism
we
must
also
be
vigilant
in
upholding
the
values
our
troops
defend
because
there
is
no
force
in
the
world
more
powerful
than
the
example
of
america
that
is
why
have
ordered
the
closing
of
the
detention
at
bay
and
will
seek
swift
and
certain
justice
for
captured
terrorists
because
living
our
values
make
us
weaker
it
makes
us
safer
and
it
makes
us
stronger
and
that
is
why
can
stand
here
tonight
and
say
without
exception
or
equivocation
that
the
united
states
of
america
does
not
torture
in
words
and
deeds
we
are
showing
the
world
that
new
era
of
engagement
has
begun
for
we
know
that
america
can
not
meet
the
threats
of
this
century
alone
but
the
world
can
not
meet
them
without
america
we
can
not
shun
the
negotiating
table
nor
ignore
the
foes
or
forces
that
could
do
us
harm
we
are
instead
called
to
move
forward
with
the
sense
of
confidence
and
that
serious
times
demand
to
seek
progress
toward
secure
and
lasting
peace
between
israel
and
her
we
have
appointed
an
envoy
to
sustain
our
effort
to
meet
the
challenges
of
the
century
from
terrorism
to
nuclear
proliferation
from
pandemic
disease
to
threats
to
crushing
poverty
we
will
strengthen
old
alliances
forge
new
ones
and
use
all
elements
of
our
national
power
and
to
respond
to
an
economic
crisis
that
is
global
in
scope
we
are
working
with
the
nations
of
the
to
restore
confidence
in
our
financial
system
avoid
the
possibility
of
escalating
protectionism
and
spur
demand
for
american
goods
in
markets
across
the
globe
for
the
world
depends
on
us
to
have
strong
economy
just
as
our
economy
depends
on
the
strength
of
the
as
we
stand
at
this
crossroads
of
history
the
eyes
of
all
people
in
all
nations
are
once
again
upon
us
watching
to
see
what
we
do
with
this
moment
waiting
for
us
to
lead
those
of
us
gathered
here
tonight
have
been
called
to
govern
in
extraordinary
times
it
is
tremendous
burden
but
also
great
privilege
one
that
has
been
entrusted
to
few
generations
of
americans
for
in
our
hands
lies
the
ability
to
shape
our
world
for
good
or
for
ill
know
that
it
is
easy
to
lose
sight
of
this
truth
to
become
cynical
and
doubtful
consumed
with
the
petty
and
the
trivial
but
in
my
life
have
also
learned
that
hope
is
found
in
unlikely
places
that
inspiration
often
comes
not
from
those
with
the
most
power
or
celebrity
but
from
the
dreams
and
aspirations
of
americans
who
are
anything
but
ordinary
think
about
the
bank
president
from
miami
who
reportedly
cashed
out
of
his
company
took
million
bonus
and
gave
it
out
to
all
people
who
worked
for
him
plus
another
who
used
to
work
for
him
he
tell
anyone
but
when
the
local
newspaper
found
out
he
simply
said
knew
some
of
these
people
since
was
years
old
did
feel
right
getting
the
money
myself
think
about
town
that
was
completely
destroyed
by
tornado
but
is
being
rebuilt
by
its
residents
as
global
example
of
how
clean
energy
can
power
an
entire
community
how
it
can
bring
jobs
and
businesses
to
place
where
piles
of
bricks
and
rubble
once
lay
the
tragedy
was
terrible
said
one
of
the
men
who
helped
them
rebuild
but
the
folks
here
know
that
it
also
provided
an
incredible
opportunity
and
think
about
the
young
girl
from
that
school
visited
in
south
place
where
the
ceilings
leak
the
paint
peels
off
the
walls
and
they
have
to
stop
teaching
six
times
day
because
the
train
barrels
by
their
classroom
she
has
been
told
that
her
school
is
hopeless
but
the
other
day
after
class
she
went
to
the
public
library
and
typed
up
letter
to
the
people
sitting
in
this
room
she
even
asked
her
principal
for
the
money
to
buy
stamp
the
letter
asks
us
for
help
and
says
we
are
just
students
trying
to
become
lawyers
doctors
congressmen
like
yourself
and
one
day
president
so
we
can
make
change
to
not
just
the
state
of
south
but
also
the
world
we
are
not
we
are
not
these
words
and
these
stories
tell
us
something
about
the
spirit
of
the
people
who
sent
us
here
they
tell
us
that
even
in
the
most
trying
times
amid
the
most
difficult
circumstances
there
is
generosity
resilience
decency
and
determination
that
perseveres
willingness
to
take
responsibility
for
our
future
and
for
posterity
their
resolve
must
be
our
inspiration
their
concerns
must
be
our
cause
and
we
must
show
them
and
all
our
people
that
we
are
equal
to
the
task
before
us
know
that
we
agreed
on
every
issue
thus
far
and
there
are
surely
times
in
the
future
when
we
will
part
ways
but
also
know
that
every
american
who
is
sitting
here
tonight
loves
this
country
and
wants
it
to
succeed
that
must
be
the
starting
point
for
every
debate
we
have
in
the
coming
months
and
where
we
return
after
those
debates
are
done
that
is
the
foundation
on
which
the
american
people
expect
us
to
build
common
ground
and
if
we
do
if
we
come
together
and
lift
this
nation
from
the
depths
of
this
crisis
if
we
put
our
people
back
to
work
and
restart
the
engine
of
our
prosperity
if
we
confront
without
fear
the
challenges
of
our
time
and
summon
that
enduring
spirit
of
an
america
that
does
not
quit
then
someday
years
from
now
our
children
can
tell
their
children
that
this
was
the
time
when
we
performed
in
the
words
that
are
carved
into
this
very
chamber
something
worthy
to
be
remembered
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
be
seated
thank
you
very
much
madam
speaker
leader
members
of
congress
dear
friends
former
colleagues
it
is
great
to
be
here
place
where
lincoln
served
was
inaugurated
and
where
the
nation
he
saved
bid
him
last
farewell
as
we
mark
the
bicentennial
of
our
president
birth
can
not
claim
to
know
as
much
about
his
life
and
works
as
many
who
are
also
speaking
today
but
can
say
that
feel
special
gratitude
to
this
singular
figure
who
in
so
many
ways
made
my
own
story
possible
and
in
so
many
ways
made
america
story
possible
it
is
fitting
that
we
are
holding
this
celebration
here
at
the
capitol
for
the
life
of
this
building
is
bound
ever
so
closely
to
the
times
of
this
immortal
president
built
by
artisans
and
craftsmen
but
also
immigrants
and
slaves
it
was
here
in
the
rotunda
that
union
soldiers
received
help
from
makeshift
hospital
it
was
downstairs
in
the
basement
that
they
were
baked
bread
to
give
them
strength
and
it
was
in
the
senate
and
house
chambers
where
they
slept
at
night
and
spent
some
of
their
days
what
those
soldiers
saw
when
they
looked
on
this
building
was
very
different
sight
than
the
one
we
see
today
for
it
remained
unfinished
until
the
end
of
the
war
the
who
built
the
dome
came
to
work
wondering
each
day
whether
that
would
be
their
last
whether
the
metal
they
were
using
for
its
frame
would
be
requisitioned
for
the
war
and
melted
down
into
bullets
but
each
day
went
by
without
any
orders
to
halt
construction
and
so
they
kept
on
working
and
kept
on
building
and
when
president
lincoln
was
finally
told
of
all
the
metal
being
used
here
his
response
was
short
and
clear
that
is
as
it
should
be
the
american
people
needed
to
be
reminded
he
believed
that
even
in
time
of
war
the
work
would
go
on
the
people
business
would
continue
that
even
when
the
nation
itself
was
in
doubt
its
future
was
being
secured
and
that
on
that
distant
day
when
the
guns
fell
silent
national
capitol
would
stand
with
statue
of
freedom
at
its
peak
as
symbol
of
unity
in
land
still
mending
its
divisions
it
is
this
sense
of
unity
this
ability
to
plan
for
shared
future
even
at
moment
where
our
nation
was
torn
apart
that
reflect
on
today
and
while
there
are
any
number
of
moments
that
reveal
that
particular
side
of
this
extraordinary
man
abraham
lincoln
that
particular
aspect
of
his
leadership
there
one
that
like
to
share
with
you
today
in
the
war
final
weeks
aboard
grant
flagship
the
river
queen
president
lincoln
was
asked
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
rebel
armies
once
general
lee
surrendered
with
victory
at
hand
lincoln
could
have
sought
revenge
he
could
have
forced
the
south
to
pay
steep
price
for
their
rebellion
but
despite
all
the
bloodshed
and
all
the
misery
that
each
side
had
exacted
upon
the
other
and
despite
his
absolute
certainty
in
the
rightness
of
the
cause
of
ending
slavery
no
confederate
soldier
was
to
be
punished
lincoln
ordered
they
were
to
be
treated
as
he
put
it
liberally
all
round
what
lincoln
wanted
was
for
confederate
troops
to
go
back
home
and
return
to
work
on
their
farms
and
in
their
shops
he
was
even
willing
he
said
to
let
them
have
their
horses
to
and
their
guns
to
shoot
crows
with
that
was
the
only
way
lincoln
knew
to
repair
the
rifts
that
had
torn
this
country
apart
it
was
the
only
way
to
begin
the
healing
that
our
nation
so
desperately
needed
what
lincoln
never
forgot
not
even
in
the
midst
of
civil
war
was
that
despite
all
that
divides
us
north
and
south
black
and
white
we
were
at
heart
one
nation
and
one
people
sharing
bond
as
americans
that
could
bend
but
would
not
break
and
so
even
as
we
meet
here
today
in
moment
when
we
are
far
less
divided
than
in
lincoln
day
but
when
we
are
once
again
debating
the
critical
issues
of
our
time
and
debating
them
sometimes
fiercely
let
us
remember
that
we
are
doing
so
as
servants
of
the
same
flag
as
representatives
of
the
same
people
and
as
stakeholders
in
common
future
that
is
the
most
fitting
tribute
we
can
pay
the
most
lasting
monument
we
can
build
to
that
most
remarkable
of
men
abraham
lincoln
thank
you
thank
you
for
your
hard
work
on
this
issue
and
on
our
economic
recovery
the
economic
crisis
we
face
is
unlike
any
we
seen
in
our
lifetime
it
crisis
of
falling
confidence
and
rising
debt
of
widely
distributed
risk
and
narrowly
concentrated
reward
crisis
written
in
the
fine
print
of
mortgages
on
the
ledger
lines
of
once
mighty
financial
institutions
and
on
the
pink
slips
that
have
upended
the
lives
of
so
many
people
across
this
country
and
cost
the
economy
million
jobs
last
year
alone
we
know
that
even
if
we
do
everything
that
we
should
this
crisis
was
years
in
the
making
and
it
will
take
more
than
weeks
or
months
to
turn
things
around
but
make
no
mistake
failure
to
act
and
act
now
will
turn
crisis
into
catastrophe
and
guarantee
longer
recession
less
robust
recovery
and
more
uncertain
future
millions
more
jobs
will
be
lost
more
businesses
will
be
shuttered
more
dreams
will
be
deferred
and
that
why
feel
such
sense
of
urgency
about
the
economic
recovery
and
reinvestment
plan
that
is
before
congress
today
with
it
we
can
save
or
create
more
than
three
million
jobs
doing
things
that
will
strengthen
our
country
for
years
to
come
it
not
merely
prescription
for
spending
it
strategy
for
economic
growth
in
areas
like
renewable
energy
and
health
care
and
education
now
in
the
past
few
days
heard
criticisms
that
this
plan
is
somehow
wanting
and
these
criticisms
echo
the
very
same
failed
economic
theories
that
led
us
into
this
crisis
in
the
first
place
the
notion
that
tax
cuts
alone
will
solve
all
our
problems
that
we
can
ignore
fundamental
challenges
like
energy
independence
and
the
high
cost
of
health
care
that
we
can
somehow
deal
with
this
in
piecemeal
fashion
and
still
expect
our
economy
and
our
country
to
thrive
reject
those
theories
and
so
did
the
american
people
when
they
went
to
the
polls
in
november
and
voted
resoundingly
for
change
so
urge
members
of
congress
to
act
without
delay
no
plan
is
perfect
and
we
should
work
to
make
it
stronger
no
one
is
more
committed
to
making
it
stronger
than
me
but
let
not
make
the
perfect
the
enemy
of
the
essential
let
show
people
all
over
the
country
who
are
looking
for
leadership
in
this
difficult
time
that
we
are
equal
to
the
task
at
the
same
time
we
know
that
this
recovery
and
reinvestment
plan
is
only
the
first
part
of
what
we
need
to
do
to
restore
prosperity
and
secure
our
future
we
also
need
strong
and
viable
financial
system
to
keep
credit
flowing
to
businesses
and
families
alike
and
my
administration
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
restore
our
financial
system
our
recovery
depends
on
it
and
so
in
the
next
week
secretary
will
release
new
strategy
to
get
credit
moving
again
strategy
that
will
reflect
some
of
the
lessons
of
past
mistakes
while
laying
the
foundation
of
the
future
but
in
order
to
restore
trust
in
our
financial
system
we
going
to
have
to
do
more
than
just
put
forward
our
plans
in
order
to
restore
trust
we
got
to
make
certain
that
taxpayer
funds
are
not
excessive
compensation
packages
on
wall
street
we
all
need
to
take
responsibility
and
this
includes
executives
at
major
financial
firms
who
turned
to
the
american
people
hat
in
hand
when
they
were
in
trouble
even
as
they
paid
themselves
customary
lavish
bonuses
as
said
last
week
this
is
the
height
of
irresponsibility
it
shameful
and
that
exactly
the
kind
of
disregard
of
the
costs
and
consequences
of
their
actions
that
brought
about
this
crisis
culture
of
narrow
and
gain
at
the
expense
of
everything
else
this
is
america
we
do
disparage
wealth
we
do
begrudge
anybody
for
achieving
success
and
we
certainly
believe
that
success
should
be
rewarded
but
what
gets
people
upset
and
rightfully
so
are
executives
being
rewarded
for
failure
especially
when
those
rewards
are
by
taxpayers
many
of
whom
are
having
tough
time
themselves
for
top
executives
to
award
themselves
these
kinds
of
compensation
packages
in
the
midst
of
this
economic
crisis
is
just
bad
taste
it
bad
strategy
and
will
not
tolerate
it
as
president
we
going
to
be
demanding
some
restraint
in
exchange
for
federal
aid
so
that
when
firms
seek
new
federal
dollars
we
find
them
up
to
the
same
old
tricks
as
part
of
the
reforms
we
announcing
today
top
executives
at
firms
receiving
extraordinary
help
from
taxpayers
will
have
their
compensation
capped
at
dollars
fraction
of
the
salaries
that
have
been
reported
recently
and
if
these
executives
receive
any
additional
compensation
it
will
come
in
the
form
of
stock
that
be
paid
up
until
taxpayers
are
paid
back
for
their
assistance
companies
receiving
federal
aid
are
going
to
have
to
disclose
publicly
all
the
perks
and
luxuries
bestowed
upon
senior
executives
and
provide
an
explanation
to
the
taxpayers
and
to
shareholders
as
to
why
these
expenses
are
justified
and
we
putting
stop
to
these
kinds
of
massive
severance
packages
we
all
read
about
with
disgust
we
taking
the
air
out
of
golden
parachutes
we
asking
these
firms
to
take
responsibility
to
the
nature
of
this
crisis
and
their
role
in
it
we
believe
that
what
we
laid
out
should
be
viewed
as
fair
and
embraced
as
basic
common
sense
and
finally
these
guidelines
we
putting
in
place
are
only
the
beginning
of
effort
we
going
to
examine
the
ways
in
which
the
means
and
manner
of
executive
compensation
have
contributed
to
reckless
culture
and
mentality
that
in
turn
helped
to
wrought
havoc
in
our
financial
system
we
going
to
be
taking
look
at
broader
reforms
so
that
executives
are
compensated
for
sound
risk
management
and
rewarded
for
growth
measured
over
years
not
just
days
or
weeks
we
all
have
to
pull
together
and
take
our
share
of
responsibility
that
true
here
in
washington
that
true
on
wall
street
the
american
people
are
carrying
huge
burden
as
result
of
this
economic
crisis
bearing
the
brunt
of
its
effects
as
well
as
the
cost
of
extraordinary
measures
we
taking
to
address
them
the
american
people
expect
and
demand
that
we
pursue
policies
that
reflect
the
reality
of
this
crisis
and
that
will
prevent
these
kinds
of
crises
from
occurring
again
in
the
future
thank
you
very
much
we
begin
this
year
and
this
administration
in
the
midst
of
an
unprecedented
crisis
that
calls
for
unprecedented
action
just
this
week
we
saw
more
people
file
for
unemployment
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
years
and
experts
agree
that
if
nothing
is
done
the
unemployment
rate
could
reach
double
digits
our
economy
could
fall
trillion
short
of
its
full
capacity
which
translates
into
more
than
in
lost
income
for
family
of
four
and
we
could
lose
generation
of
potential
as
more
young
americans
are
forced
to
forgo
college
dreams
or
the
chance
to
train
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
in
short
if
we
do
not
act
boldly
and
swiftly
bad
situation
could
become
dramatically
worse
that
is
why
have
proposed
an
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
plan
to
immediately
jumpstart
job
creation
as
well
as
economic
growth
am
pleased
to
say
that
both
parties
in
congress
are
already
hard
at
work
on
this
plan
and
hope
to
sign
it
into
law
in
less
than
month
plan
that
will
save
or
create
three
to
four
million
jobs
over
the
next
few
years
and
one
that
both
the
paradox
and
the
promise
of
this
moment
the
fact
that
there
are
millions
of
americans
trying
to
find
work
even
as
all
around
the
country
so
much
work
to
be
done
why
this
is
not
just
program
to
boost
employment
one
that
will
invest
in
our
most
important
priorities
like
energy
and
education
health
care
and
new
infrastructure
that
are
necessary
to
keep
us
strong
and
competitive
in
the
century
today
like
to
talk
specifically
about
the
progress
we
expect
to
make
in
each
of
these
areas
to
accelerate
the
creation
of
clean
energy
economy
we
will
double
our
capacity
to
generate
alternative
sources
of
energy
like
wind
solar
and
over
the
next
three
years
begin
to
build
new
electricity
grid
that
lay
down
more
than
miles
of
transmission
lines
to
convey
this
new
energy
from
coast
to
coast
save
taxpayers
billion
year
by
making
of
federal
buildings
more
energy
efficient
and
save
the
average
working
family
on
their
energy
bills
by
million
homes
to
lower
health
care
cost
cut
medical
errors
and
improve
care
the
health
record
in
five
years
saving
billions
of
dollars
in
health
care
costs
and
countless
lives
and
protect
health
insurance
for
more
than
million
americans
who
are
in
danger
of
losing
their
coverage
during
this
economic
downturn
to
ensure
our
children
can
compete
and
succeed
in
this
new
economy
renovate
and
schools
building
classrooms
libraries
and
labs
to
improve
learning
for
over
five
million
students
invest
more
in
grants
to
make
college
affordable
for
seven
million
more
students
provide
college
tax
credit
to
four
million
students
and
triple
the
number
of
fellowships
in
science
to
help
spur
the
next
generation
of
innovation
finally
we
will
rebuild
and
retrofit
america
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
century
that
means
repairing
and
thousands
of
miles
of
roadways
and
providing
new
mass
transit
options
for
millions
of
americans
it
means
protecting
america
by
securing
major
ports
and
creating
better
communications
network
for
local
law
enforcement
and
public
safety
officials
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
and
it
means
expanding
broadband
access
to
millions
of
americans
so
business
can
compete
on
field
wherever
located
know
that
some
are
about
the
size
and
scale
of
this
recovery
plan
understand
that
which
is
why
this
recovery
plan
must
and
will
include
unprecedented
measures
that
will
allow
the
american
people
to
hold
my
administration
accountable
for
these
results
we
just
throw
money
at
our
problems
invest
in
what
works
instead
of
politicians
doling
out
money
behind
veil
of
secrecy
decisions
about
where
we
invest
will
be
made
public
and
informed
by
independent
experts
whenever
possible
launch
an
unprecedented
effort
to
root
out
waste
inefficiency
and
unnecessary
spending
in
our
government
and
every
american
will
be
able
to
see
how
and
where
we
spend
taxpayer
dollars
by
going
to
new
website
called
no
one
policy
or
program
will
solve
the
challenges
we
face
right
now
nor
will
this
crisis
recede
in
short
period
of
time
but
if
we
act
now
and
act
boldly
if
we
start
rewarding
hard
work
and
responsibility
once
more
if
we
act
as
citizens
and
not
partisans
and
begin
again
the
work
of
remaking
america
then
have
faith
that
we
will
emerge
from
this
trying
time
even
stronger
and
more
prosperous
than
we
were
before
thanks
for
listening
my
fellow
citizens
stand
here
today
humbled
by
the
task
before
us
grateful
for
the
trust
you
bestowed
mindful
of
the
sacrifices
borne
by
our
ancestors
thank
president
bush
for
his
service
to
our
nation
as
well
as
the
generosity
and
cooperation
he
has
shown
throughout
this
transition
americans
have
now
taken
the
presidential
oath
the
words
have
been
spoken
during
rising
tides
of
prosperity
and
the
still
waters
of
peace
yet
every
so
often
the
oath
is
taken
amidst
gathering
clouds
and
raging
storms
at
these
moments
america
has
carried
on
not
simply
because
of
the
skill
or
vision
of
those
in
high
office
but
because
we
the
people
have
remained
faithful
to
the
ideals
of
our
sic
and
true
to
our
founding
documents
so
it
has
been
so
it
must
be
with
this
generation
of
americans
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
crisis
is
now
well
understood
our
nation
is
at
war
against
network
of
violence
and
hatred
our
economy
is
badly
weakened
consequence
of
greed
and
irresponsibility
on
the
part
of
some
but
also
our
collective
failure
to
make
hard
choices
and
prepare
the
nation
for
new
age
homes
have
been
lost
jobs
shed
businesses
shuttered
our
health
care
is
too
costly
our
schools
fail
too
many
and
each
day
brings
further
evidence
that
the
ways
we
use
energy
strengthen
our
adversaries
and
threaten
our
planet
these
are
the
indicators
of
crisis
subject
to
data
and
statistics
less
measurable
but
no
less
profound
is
sapping
of
confidence
across
our
land
nagging
fear
that
america
decline
is
inevitable
that
the
next
generation
must
lower
its
sights
today
say
to
you
that
the
challenges
we
face
are
real
they
are
serious
and
they
are
many
they
will
not
be
met
easily
or
in
short
span
of
time
but
know
this
america
they
will
be
met
on
this
day
we
gather
because
we
have
chosen
hope
over
fear
unity
of
purpose
over
conflict
and
discord
on
this
day
we
come
to
proclaim
an
end
to
the
petty
grievances
and
false
promises
the
recriminations
and
worn
out
dogmas
that
for
far
too
long
have
strangled
our
politics
we
remain
young
nation
but
in
the
words
of
scripture
the
time
has
come
to
set
aside
childish
things
the
time
has
come
to
reaffirm
our
enduring
spirit
to
choose
our
better
history
to
carry
forward
that
precious
gift
that
noble
idea
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
the
promise
that
all
are
equal
all
are
free
and
all
deserve
chance
to
pursue
their
full
measure
of
happiness
in
reaffirming
the
greatness
of
our
nation
we
understand
that
greatness
is
never
given
it
must
be
earned
our
journey
has
never
been
one
of
or
settling
for
less
it
has
not
been
the
path
for
the
for
those
who
prefer
leisure
over
work
or
seek
only
the
pleasures
of
riches
and
fame
rather
it
has
been
the
the
doers
the
makers
of
things
some
celebrated
but
more
often
men
and
women
obscure
in
their
who
have
carried
us
up
the
long
rugged
path
towards
prosperity
and
freedom
for
us
they
packed
up
their
few
worldly
possessions
and
across
oceans
in
search
of
new
life
for
us
they
toiled
in
sweatshops
and
settled
the
west
endured
the
lash
of
the
whip
and
the
hard
earth
for
us
they
fought
and
died
in
places
like
concord
and
normandy
and
time
and
again
these
men
and
women
struggled
and
sacrificed
and
worked
till
their
hands
were
raw
so
that
we
might
live
better
life
they
saw
america
as
bigger
than
the
sum
of
our
individual
ambitions
greater
than
all
the
differences
of
birth
or
wealth
or
faction
this
is
the
journey
we
continue
today
we
remain
the
most
prosperous
powerful
nation
on
earth
our
workers
are
no
less
productive
than
when
this
crisis
began
our
minds
are
no
less
inventive
our
goods
and
services
no
less
needed
than
they
were
last
week
or
last
month
or
last
year
our
capacity
remains
undiminished
but
our
time
of
standing
pat
of
protecting
narrow
interests
and
putting
off
unpleasant
decisions
that
time
has
surely
passed
starting
today
we
must
pick
ourselves
up
dust
ourselves
off
and
begin
again
the
work
of
remaking
america
for
everywhere
we
look
there
is
work
to
be
done
the
state
of
our
economy
calls
for
action
bold
and
swift
and
we
will
act
not
only
to
create
new
jobs
but
to
lay
new
foundation
for
growth
we
will
build
the
roads
and
bridges
the
electric
grids
and
digital
lines
that
feed
our
commerce
and
bind
us
together
we
will
restore
science
to
its
rightful
place
and
wield
technology
wonders
to
raise
health
care
quality
and
lower
its
cost
we
will
harness
the
sun
and
the
winds
and
the
soil
to
fuel
our
cars
and
run
our
factories
and
we
will
transform
our
schools
and
colleges
and
universities
to
meet
the
demands
of
new
age
all
this
we
can
do
all
this
we
will
do
now
there
are
some
who
question
the
scale
of
our
ambitions
who
suggest
that
our
system
can
not
tolerate
too
many
big
plans
their
memories
are
short
for
they
have
forgotten
what
this
country
has
already
done
what
free
men
and
women
can
achieve
when
imagination
is
joined
to
common
purpose
and
necessity
to
courage
what
the
cynics
fail
to
understand
is
that
the
ground
has
shifted
beneath
them
that
the
stale
political
arguments
that
have
consumed
us
for
so
long
no
longer
apply
the
question
we
ask
today
is
not
whether
our
government
is
too
big
or
too
small
but
whether
it
works
whether
it
helps
families
find
jobs
at
decent
wage
care
they
can
afford
retirement
that
is
dignified
where
the
answer
is
yes
we
intend
to
move
forward
where
the
answer
is
no
programs
will
end
and
those
of
us
who
manage
the
public
dollars
will
be
held
to
account
to
spend
wisely
reform
bad
habits
and
do
our
business
in
the
light
of
day
because
only
then
can
we
restore
the
vital
trust
between
people
and
their
government
nor
is
the
question
before
us
whether
the
market
is
force
for
good
or
its
power
to
generate
wealth
and
expand
freedom
is
unmatched
but
this
crisis
has
reminded
us
that
without
watchful
eye
the
market
can
spin
out
of
control
the
nation
can
not
prosper
long
when
it
only
the
prosperous
the
success
of
our
economy
has
always
depended
not
just
on
the
size
of
our
gross
domestic
product
but
on
the
reach
of
our
prosperity
on
the
ability
to
extend
opportunity
to
every
willing
heart
not
out
of
charity
but
because
it
is
the
surest
route
to
our
common
good
as
for
our
common
we
reject
as
false
the
choice
between
our
safety
and
our
ideals
our
founding
fathers
our
founding
fathers
faced
with
perils
that
we
can
scarcely
imagine
drafted
charter
to
assure
the
rule
of
law
and
the
rights
of
man
charter
expanded
by
the
blood
of
generations
those
ideals
still
light
the
world
and
we
will
not
give
them
up
for
expedience
sake
and
so
to
all
the
other
peoples
and
governments
who
are
watching
today
from
the
grandest
capitals
to
the
small
village
where
my
father
was
born
know
that
america
is
friend
of
each
nation
and
every
man
woman
and
child
who
seeks
future
of
peace
and
dignity
and
we
are
ready
to
lead
once
more
recall
that
earlier
generations
faced
down
fascism
and
communism
not
just
with
missiles
and
tanks
but
with
the
sturdy
alliances
and
enduring
convictions
they
understood
that
our
power
alone
can
not
protect
us
nor
does
it
entitle
us
to
do
as
we
please
instead
they
knew
that
our
power
grows
through
its
prudent
use
our
security
emanates
from
the
justness
of
our
cause
the
force
of
our
example
the
tempering
qualities
of
humility
and
restraint
we
are
the
keepers
of
this
legacy
guided
by
these
principles
once
more
we
can
meet
those
new
threats
that
demand
even
greater
effort
even
greater
cooperation
and
understanding
between
nations
we
will
begin
to
responsibly
leave
iraq
to
its
people
and
forge
peace
in
with
old
friends
and
former
foes
we
will
work
tirelessly
to
lessen
the
nuclear
threat
and
roll
back
the
of
warming
planet
we
will
not
for
our
way
of
life
nor
will
we
waver
in
its
and
for
those
who
seek
to
advance
their
aims
by
inducing
terror
and
slaughtering
innocents
we
say
to
you
now
that
our
spirit
is
stronger
and
can
not
be
broken
you
can
not
outlast
us
and
we
will
defeat
you
for
we
know
that
our
patchwork
heritage
is
strength
not
weakness
we
are
nation
of
and
muslims
jews
and
and
we
are
shaped
by
every
language
and
culture
drawn
from
every
end
of
this
earth
and
because
we
have
tasted
the
bitter
swill
of
civil
war
and
segregation
and
emerged
from
that
dark
chapter
stronger
and
more
united
we
can
not
help
but
believe
that
the
old
hatreds
shall
someday
pass
that
the
lines
of
tribe
shall
soon
dissolve
that
as
the
world
grows
smaller
our
common
humanity
shall
reveal
itself
and
that
america
must
play
its
role
in
ushering
in
new
era
of
peace
to
the
muslim
world
we
seek
new
way
forward
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
to
those
leaders
around
the
globe
who
seek
to
sow
conflict
or
blame
their
society
ills
on
the
west
know
that
your
people
will
judge
you
on
what
you
can
build
not
what
you
destroy
to
those
to
those
who
cling
to
power
through
corruption
and
deceit
and
the
silencing
of
dissent
know
that
you
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
but
that
we
will
extend
hand
if
you
are
willing
to
unclench
your
fist
to
the
people
of
poor
nations
we
pledge
to
work
alongside
you
to
make
your
farms
flourish
and
let
clean
waters
flow
to
nourish
starved
bodies
and
feed
hungry
minds
and
to
those
nations
like
ours
that
enjoy
relative
plenty
we
say
we
can
no
longer
afford
indifference
to
the
suffering
outside
our
borders
nor
can
we
consume
the
world
resources
without
regard
to
effect
for
the
world
has
changed
and
we
must
change
with
it
as
we
consider
the
road
that
unfolds
before
us
we
remember
with
humble
gratitude
those
brave
americans
who
at
this
very
hour
patrol
deserts
and
distant
mountains
they
have
something
to
tell
us
just
as
the
fallen
who
lie
in
whisper
through
the
ages
we
them
not
only
because
they
are
the
guardians
of
our
liberty
but
because
they
embody
the
spirit
of
service
willingness
to
find
meaning
in
something
greater
than
themselves
and
yet
at
this
moment
moment
that
will
define
generation
it
is
precisely
this
spirit
that
must
inhabit
us
all
for
as
much
as
government
can
do
and
must
do
it
is
ultimately
the
faith
and
determination
of
the
american
people
upon
which
this
nation
relies
it
is
the
kindness
to
take
in
stranger
when
the
break
the
of
workers
who
would
rather
cut
their
hours
than
see
friend
lose
their
job
which
sees
us
through
our
darkest
hours
it
is
the
firefighter
courage
to
storm
stairway
filled
with
smoke
but
also
parent
willingness
to
nurture
child
that
finally
decides
our
fate
our
challenges
may
be
new
the
instruments
with
which
we
meet
them
may
be
new
but
those
values
upon
which
our
success
depends
honesty
and
hard
work
courage
and
fair
play
tolerance
and
curiosity
loyalty
and
patriotism
these
things
are
old
these
things
are
true
they
have
been
the
quiet
force
of
progress
throughout
our
history
what
is
demanded
then
is
return
to
these
truths
what
is
required
of
us
now
is
new
era
of
responsibility
recognition
on
the
part
of
every
american
that
we
have
duties
to
ourselves
our
nation
and
the
world
duties
that
we
do
not
grudgingly
accept
but
rather
seize
gladly
firm
in
the
knowledge
that
there
is
nothing
so
satisfying
to
the
spirit
so
defining
of
our
character
than
giving
our
all
to
difficult
task
this
is
the
price
and
the
promise
of
citizenship
this
is
the
source
of
our
confidence
the
knowledge
that
god
calls
on
us
to
shape
an
uncertain
destiny
this
is
the
meaning
of
our
liberty
and
our
creed
why
men
and
women
and
children
of
every
race
and
every
faith
can
join
in
celebration
across
this
magnificent
mall
and
why
man
whose
father
less
than
sixty
years
ago
might
not
have
been
served
at
local
restaurant
can
now
stand
before
you
to
take
most
sacred
oath
so
let
us
mark
this
day
with
remembrance
of
who
we
are
and
how
far
we
have
in
the
year
of
america
birth
in
the
coldest
of
months
small
band
of
patriots
huddled
by
dying
campfires
on
the
shores
of
an
icy
river
the
capitol
was
abandoned
the
enemy
was
advancing
the
snow
was
stained
with
blood
at
moment
when
the
outcome
of
our
revolution
was
most
in
doubt
the
father
of
our
nation
ordered
these
words
be
read
to
the
people
let
it
be
told
to
the
future
world
that
in
the
depth
of
winter
when
nothing
but
hope
and
virtue
could
survive
that
the
city
and
the
country
alarmed
at
one
common
danger
came
forth
to
meet
it
america
in
the
face
of
our
common
dangers
in
this
winter
of
our
hardship
let
us
remember
these
timeless
words
with
hope
and
virtue
let
us
brave
once
more
the
icy
currents
and
endure
what
storms
may
come
let
it
be
said
by
our
children
children
that
when
we
were
tested
we
refused
to
let
this
journey
end
that
we
did
not
turn
back
nor
did
we
falter
and
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
horizon
and
god
grace
upon
us
we
carried
forth
that
great
gift
of
freedom
and
delivered
it
safely
to
future
generations
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
hello
america
want
to
thank
all
the
speakers
and
performers
today
for
reminding
us
through
song
and
through
words
just
what
it
is
that
we
love
about
america
want
to
thank
all
of
you
for
braving
the
cold
and
the
crowds
and
in
some
cases
thousands
of
miles
to
join
us
here
today
welcome
to
washington
and
welcome
to
this
celebration
of
american
renewal
in
the
course
of
our
history
only
handful
of
generations
have
been
asked
to
confront
challenges
as
serious
as
the
ones
we
face
right
now
our
nation
is
at
war
our
economy
is
in
crisis
millions
of
americans
are
losing
their
jobs
and
their
homes
they
worried
about
how
they
afford
college
for
their
kids
or
pay
the
stack
of
bills
on
their
kitchen
table
and
most
of
all
they
anxious
and
uncertain
about
the
future
about
whether
this
generation
of
americans
will
be
able
to
pass
on
what
best
about
this
country
to
our
children
and
their
children
pretend
that
meeting
any
one
of
these
challenges
will
be
easy
it
will
take
more
than
month
or
year
and
it
will
likely
take
many
along
the
way
there
will
be
setbacks
and
false
starts
and
days
that
test
our
resolve
as
nation
but
despite
all
this
despite
the
enormity
of
the
task
that
lies
ahead
stand
here
today
as
hopeful
as
ever
that
the
united
states
of
america
will
endure
that
it
will
prevail
that
the
dream
of
our
founders
will
live
on
in
our
time
what
gives
me
hope
is
what
see
when
look
out
across
this
mall
for
in
these
monuments
are
chiseled
those
unlikely
stories
that
affirm
our
unyielding
faith
faith
that
anything
is
possible
in
america
rising
before
us
stands
memorial
to
man
who
led
small
band
of
farmers
and
shopkeepers
in
revolution
against
the
army
of
an
empire
all
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
on
the
ground
below
is
tribute
to
generation
that
withstood
war
and
depression
men
and
women
like
my
grandparents
who
toiled
on
bomber
assembly
lines
and
marched
across
europe
to
free
the
world
from
tyranny
grasp
directly
in
front
of
us
is
pool
that
still
reflects
the
dream
of
king
and
the
glory
of
people
who
marched
and
bled
so
that
their
children
might
be
judged
by
their
character
content
and
behind
me
watching
over
the
union
he
saved
sits
the
man
who
in
so
many
ways
made
this
day
possible
and
yet
as
stand
here
today
what
gives
me
the
greatest
hope
of
all
is
not
the
stone
and
marble
that
surrounds
us
but
what
what
fills
the
spaces
in
between
it
is
you
americans
of
every
race
and
region
and
station
who
came
here
because
you
believe
in
what
this
country
can
be
and
because
you
want
to
help
us
get
there
it
the
same
thing
that
gave
me
hope
from
the
day
we
began
this
campaign
for
the
presidency
nearly
two
years
ago
belief
that
if
we
could
just
ourselves
in
one
another
and
bring
everyone
together
democrats
republicans
independents
latino
asian
and
native
american
black
and
white
gay
and
straight
disabled
and
not
then
not
only
would
we
restore
hope
and
opportunity
in
places
that
yearned
for
both
but
maybe
just
maybe
we
might
perfect
our
union
in
the
process
this
is
what
believed
but
you
made
this
belief
real
you
proved
once
more
that
people
who
love
this
country
can
change
it
and
as
prepare
to
assume
the
presidency
yours
are
the
voices
will
take
with
me
every
day
when
walk
into
that
oval
office
the
voices
of
men
and
women
who
have
different
stories
but
hold
common
hopes
who
ask
only
for
what
was
promised
us
as
americans
that
we
might
make
of
our
lives
what
we
will
and
see
our
children
climb
higher
than
we
did
it
is
this
thread
that
binds
us
together
in
common
effort
that
runs
through
every
memorial
on
this
mall
that
connects
us
to
all
those
who
struggled
and
sacrificed
and
stood
here
before
it
is
how
this
nation
has
overcome
the
greatest
differences
and
the
longest
odds
because
there
is
no
obstacle
that
can
stand
in
the
way
of
millions
of
voices
calling
for
change
that
is
the
belief
with
which
we
began
this
campaign
and
that
is
how
we
will
overcome
what
ails
us
now
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
road
will
be
long
that
our
climb
will
be
steep
but
never
forget
that
the
true
character
of
our
nation
is
revealed
not
during
times
of
comfort
and
ease
but
by
the
right
we
do
when
the
moment
is
hard
ask
you
to
help
reveal
that
character
once
more
and
together
we
can
carry
forward
as
one
nation
and
one
people
the
legacy
of
our
forefathers
that
we
celebrate
today
thank
you
america
god
bless
you
let
me
begin
by
thanking
george
mason
university
for
their
extraordinary
hospitality
and
to
thank
all
the
great
friends
the
governors
the
mayors
who
are
in
attendance
here
today
throughout
america
history
there
have
been
some
years
that
simply
rolled
into
the
next
without
much
notice
or
fanfare
and
then
there
are
the
years
that
come
along
once
in
generation
the
kind
that
mark
clean
break
from
troubled
past
and
set
new
course
for
our
nation
this
is
one
of
those
years
we
start
in
the
midst
of
crisis
unlike
any
we
have
seen
in
our
lifetime
crisis
that
has
only
deepened
over
the
last
few
weeks
nearly
two
million
jobs
have
been
now
lost
and
on
friday
we
likely
to
learn
that
we
lost
more
jobs
last
year
than
at
any
time
since
world
war
just
in
the
past
year
another
million
americans
who
want
and
need
work
have
had
to
settle
for
jobs
manufacturing
has
hit
low
many
businesses
can
not
borrow
or
make
payroll
many
families
can
not
pay
their
bills
or
their
mortgage
many
workers
are
watching
their
life
savings
disappear
and
many
many
americans
are
both
anxious
and
uncertain
of
what
the
future
will
hold
now
do
believe
it
too
late
to
change
course
but
it
will
be
if
we
do
take
dramatic
action
as
soon
as
possible
if
nothing
is
done
this
recession
could
linger
for
years
the
unemployment
rate
could
reach
double
digits
our
economy
could
fall
trillion
dollars
short
of
its
full
capacity
which
translates
into
more
than
dollars
in
lost
income
for
family
of
four
we
could
lose
generation
of
potential
and
promise
as
more
young
americans
are
forced
to
forego
dreams
of
college
or
the
chance
to
train
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
and
our
nation
could
lose
the
competitive
edge
that
has
served
as
foundation
for
our
strength
and
our
standing
in
the
world
in
short
bad
situation
could
become
dramatically
worse
this
crisis
did
not
happen
solely
by
some
accident
of
history
or
normal
turn
of
the
business
cycle
and
we
get
out
of
it
by
simply
waiting
for
better
day
to
come
or
relying
on
the
dogmas
of
the
past
we
arrived
at
this
point
due
to
an
era
of
profound
irresponsibility
that
stretched
from
corporate
board
rooms
to
the
halls
of
power
in
washington
for
years
too
many
wall
street
executives
made
imprudent
and
dangerous
decisions
seeking
profits
with
too
little
regard
for
risk
too
little
regulatory
scrutiny
and
too
little
accountability
banks
made
loans
without
concern
for
whether
borrowers
could
repay
them
and
some
borrowers
took
advantage
of
cheap
credit
to
take
on
debt
they
could
afford
politicians
spent
taxpayer
money
without
wisdom
or
discipline
and
too
often
focused
on
scoring
political
points
instead
of
problems
they
were
sent
here
to
solve
the
result
has
been
devastating
loss
of
trust
and
confidence
in
our
economy
our
financial
markets
and
our
government
now
the
very
fact
that
this
crisis
is
largely
of
our
own
making
means
that
it
not
beyond
our
ability
to
solve
our
problems
are
rooted
in
past
mistakes
not
our
capacity
for
future
greatness
it
will
take
time
perhaps
many
years
but
we
can
rebuild
that
lost
trust
and
confidence
we
can
restore
opportunity
and
prosperity
we
should
never
forget
that
our
workers
are
still
more
productive
than
any
on
earth
our
universities
are
still
the
envy
of
the
world
we
are
still
home
to
the
most
brilliant
minds
the
most
creative
entrepreneurs
and
the
most
advanced
technology
and
innovation
that
history
has
ever
known
and
we
are
still
the
nation
that
has
overcome
great
fears
and
improbable
odds
if
we
act
with
the
urgency
and
seriousness
that
this
moment
requires
know
that
we
can
do
it
again
that
is
why
have
moved
quickly
to
work
with
my
economic
team
and
leaders
of
both
parties
on
an
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
plan
that
will
immediately
job
creation
and
growth
it
plan
that
represents
not
just
new
policy
but
whole
new
approach
to
meeting
our
most
urgent
challenges
for
if
we
hope
to
end
this
crisis
we
must
end
the
culture
of
anything
goes
that
helped
create
it
and
this
change
must
begin
in
washington
it
time
to
trade
old
habits
for
new
spirit
of
responsibility
it
time
to
finally
change
the
ways
of
washington
so
that
we
can
set
new
and
better
course
for
america
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
cost
of
this
plan
will
be
considerable
it
will
certainly
add
to
the
budget
deficit
in
the
short
term
but
equally
certain
are
the
consequences
of
doing
too
little
or
nothing
at
all
for
that
will
lead
to
an
even
greater
deficit
of
jobs
incomes
and
confidence
in
our
economy
it
is
true
that
we
can
not
depend
on
government
alone
to
create
jobs
or
growth
but
at
this
particular
moment
only
government
can
provide
the
boost
necessary
to
lift
us
from
recession
this
deep
and
severe
only
government
can
break
the
cycle
that
are
sic
crippling
our
economy
where
lack
of
spending
leads
to
lost
jobs
which
leads
to
even
less
spending
where
an
inability
to
lend
and
borrow
stops
growth
and
leads
to
even
less
credit
that
why
we
need
to
act
boldly
and
act
now
to
reverse
these
cycles
that
why
we
need
to
put
money
in
the
pockets
of
the
american
people
create
new
jobs
and
invest
in
our
future
that
why
we
need
to
restart
the
flow
of
credit
and
restore
the
rules
of
the
road
that
will
ensure
crisis
like
this
never
happens
again
now
this
plan
begins
with
this
plan
must
begin
today
plan
am
confident
will
save
or
create
at
least
three
million
jobs
over
the
next
few
years
it
not
just
another
public
works
program
it
plan
that
both
the
paradox
and
promise
of
this
moment
the
fact
that
there
are
millions
of
americans
trying
to
find
work
even
as
all
around
the
country
there
so
much
work
to
be
done
and
that
why
we
invest
in
priorities
like
energy
and
education
health
care
and
new
infrastructure
that
are
necessary
to
keep
us
strong
and
competitive
in
the
century
that
why
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
jobs
created
will
be
in
the
private
sector
while
our
plan
will
save
the
public
sector
jobs
of
teachers
police
officers
firefighters
and
others
who
provide
vital
services
to
finally
spark
the
creation
of
clean
energy
economy
we
will
double
the
production
of
alternative
energy
in
the
next
three
years
we
will
more
than
percent
of
federal
buildings
and
improve
the
energy
efficiency
of
million
american
homes
saving
consumers
and
taxpayers
billions
on
our
energy
bills
in
the
process
we
will
put
americans
to
work
in
new
jobs
that
pay
well
and
be
jobs
building
solar
panels
and
wind
turbines
constructing
cars
and
buildings
and
developing
the
new
energy
technologies
that
will
lead
to
even
more
jobs
more
savings
and
cleaner
safer
planet
in
the
bargain
to
improve
the
quality
of
our
health
care
while
lowering
its
cost
we
will
make
the
immediate
investments
necessary
to
ensure
that
within
five
years
all
of
america
medical
records
are
this
will
cut
waste
eliminate
red
tape
and
reduce
the
need
to
repeat
expensive
medical
tests
but
it
just
save
billions
of
dollars
and
thousands
of
jobs
it
will
save
lives
by
reducing
the
deadly
but
preventable
medical
errors
that
pervade
our
health
care
system
to
give
our
children
the
chance
to
live
out
their
dreams
in
world
that
never
been
more
competitive
we
will
equip
tens
of
thousands
of
schools
community
colleges
and
public
universities
with
century
classrooms
labs
and
libraries
we
provide
new
computers
new
technology
and
new
training
for
teachers
so
that
students
in
chicago
and
boston
can
compete
with
children
in
beijing
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
to
build
an
economy
that
can
lead
this
future
we
will
begin
to
rebuild
america
yes
we
put
people
to
work
repairing
crumbling
roads
bridges
and
schools
by
eliminating
the
backlog
of
worthy
and
needed
infrastructure
projects
but
we
also
do
more
to
retrofit
america
for
global
economy
that
means
updating
the
way
we
get
our
electricity
by
starting
to
build
new
smart
grid
that
will
save
us
money
protect
our
power
sources
from
blackout
or
attack
and
deliver
clean
alternative
forms
of
energy
to
every
corner
of
our
nation
it
means
expanding
broadband
lines
across
america
so
that
small
business
in
rural
town
can
connect
and
compete
with
their
counterparts
anywhere
in
the
world
it
means
investing
in
the
science
research
and
technology
that
will
lead
to
new
medical
breakthroughs
new
discoveries
and
entire
new
industries
and
finally
this
recovery
and
reinvestment
plan
will
provide
immediate
relief
to
states
workers
and
families
who
are
bearing
the
brunt
of
this
recession
to
get
people
spending
again
of
working
families
will
receive
thousand
dollar
tax
cut
the
first
stage
of
tax
cut
that
promised
during
the
campaign
and
will
include
in
our
next
budget
to
help
americans
who
have
lost
their
jobs
and
find
new
ones
we
continue
the
bipartisan
extension
of
unemployment
insurance
and
health
care
coverage
to
help
them
through
this
crisis
government
at
every
level
will
have
to
tighten
its
belt
but
we
help
struggling
states
avoid
harmful
budget
cuts
as
long
as
they
take
responsibility
and
use
the
money
to
maintain
essential
services
like
police
fire
education
and
health
care
now
understand
that
some
might
be
of
this
plan
our
government
has
already
spent
good
deal
of
money
but
we
have
yet
seen
that
translate
into
more
jobs
or
higher
incomes
or
renewed
confidence
in
our
economy
and
that
why
the
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
plan
just
throw
money
at
our
problems
we
invest
in
what
works
the
true
test
of
policies
we
pursue
be
whether
they
democratic
or
republican
ideas
whether
they
conservative
or
liberal
ideas
but
whether
they
create
jobs
grow
our
economy
and
put
the
american
dream
within
the
reach
of
the
american
people
instead
of
politicians
doling
out
money
behind
veil
of
secrecy
decisions
about
where
we
invest
will
be
made
transparently
and
informed
by
independent
experts
wherever
possible
every
american
will
be
able
to
hold
washington
accountable
for
these
decisions
by
going
to
see
how
and
where
their
taxpayer
dollars
are
being
spent
and
as
announced
yesterday
we
will
launch
an
unprecedented
effort
to
eliminate
unwise
and
unnecessary
spending
that
has
never
been
more
unaffordable
for
our
nation
and
our
children
future
than
it
is
right
now
we
have
to
make
tough
choices
and
smart
investments
today
so
that
as
the
economy
recovers
the
deficits
start
coming
down
we
can
not
have
solid
recovery
if
our
people
and
our
businesses
do
have
confidence
that
we
getting
our
fiscal
house
in
order
and
that
why
our
goal
is
not
to
create
slew
of
new
government
programs
but
foundation
for
economic
growth
that
also
means
an
economic
recovery
plan
that
is
free
from
and
pet
projects
understand
that
every
member
of
congress
has
ideas
about
how
to
spend
money
many
of
these
projects
are
worthy
they
benefit
local
communities
but
this
emergency
legislation
must
not
be
the
vehicle
for
those
aspirations
this
must
be
time
when
leaders
in
both
parties
put
the
urgent
needs
of
our
nation
above
our
own
narrow
interests
now
this
recovery
plan
alone
will
not
solve
all
the
problems
that
led
us
into
this
crisis
we
must
also
work
with
the
same
sense
of
urgency
to
and
repair
the
financial
system
we
all
depend
on
that
means
using
our
full
arsenal
of
tools
to
get
credit
flowing
again
to
families
and
businesses
while
restoring
confidence
in
our
markets
it
means
launching
sweeping
effort
to
address
the
foreclosure
crisis
so
that
we
can
keep
responsible
families
in
their
homes
it
means
preventing
the
catastrophic
failure
of
financial
institutions
whose
collapse
could
endanger
the
entire
economy
but
only
with
maximum
protections
for
taxpayers
and
clear
understanding
that
government
support
for
any
company
is
an
extraordinary
action
that
must
come
with
significant
restrictions
on
the
firms
that
receive
support
and
it
means
reforming
weak
and
outdated
regulatory
system
so
that
we
can
better
withstand
financial
shocks
and
better
protect
consumers
investors
and
businesses
from
the
reckless
greed
and
that
must
never
endanger
our
prosperity
again
no
longer
can
we
allow
wall
street
wrongdoers
to
slip
through
regulatory
cracks
no
longer
can
we
allow
special
interests
to
put
their
thumbs
on
the
economic
scales
no
longer
can
we
allow
the
unscrupulous
lending
and
borrowing
that
leads
only
to
destructive
cycles
of
bubble
and
bust
it
is
time
to
set
new
course
for
this
economy
and
that
change
must
begin
now
we
should
have
an
open
and
honest
discussion
about
this
recovery
plan
in
the
days
ahead
but
urge
congress
to
move
as
quickly
as
possible
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
for
every
day
we
wait
or
point
fingers
or
drag
our
feet
more
americans
will
lose
their
jobs
more
families
will
lose
their
savings
more
dreams
will
be
deferred
and
denied
and
our
nation
will
sink
deeper
into
crisis
that
at
some
point
we
may
not
be
able
to
reverse
that
is
not
the
country
know
it
is
not
future
accept
as
president
of
the
united
states
world
that
depends
on
the
strength
of
our
economy
is
now
watching
and
waiting
for
america
to
lead
once
more
and
that
is
what
we
will
do
it
will
not
come
easy
or
happen
overnight
and
it
is
altogether
likely
that
things
may
get
worse
before
they
get
better
but
that
is
all
the
more
reason
for
congress
to
act
without
delay
know
the
scale
of
this
plan
is
unprecedented
but
so
is
the
severity
of
our
situation
we
have
already
tried
the
approach
to
our
problems
and
it
is
the
same
approach
that
helped
lead
us
to
this
day
of
reckoning
and
that
is
why
the
time
has
come
to
build
century
economy
in
which
hard
work
and
responsibility
are
once
again
rewarded
that
why
asking
congress
to
work
with
me
and
my
team
day
and
night
on
weekends
if
necessary
to
get
the
plan
passed
in
the
next
few
weeks
that
why
calling
on
all
americans
democrats
and
republicans
and
independents
to
put
to
put
good
ideas
ahead
of
the
old
ideological
battles
sense
of
common
purpose
above
the
same
narrow
partisanship
and
insist
that
the
first
question
each
of
us
asks
is
what
good
for
me
but
what
good
for
the
country
my
children
will
inherit
more
than
any
program
or
policy
it
is
this
spirit
that
will
enable
us
to
confront
these
challenges
with
the
same
spirit
that
has
led
previous
generations
to
face
down
war
and
depression
and
fear
itself
and
if
we
do
if
we
are
able
to
summon
that
spirit
again
if
we
are
able
to
look
out
for
one
another
and
listen
to
one
another
and
do
our
part
for
our
nation
and
for
posterity
then
have
no
doubt
that
years
from
now
we
will
look
back
on
as
one
of
those
years
that
marked
another
new
and
hopeful
beginning
for
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
america
morning
everybody
last
week
vice
and
began
the
process
of
announcing
our
economic
team
today
we
are
pleased
to
name
another
key
member
of
this
team
our
nominee
for
secretary
of
commerce
my
great
friend
governor
bill
with
each
passing
day
the
work
our
team
has
begun
developing
plans
to
revive
our
economy
becomes
more
urgent
earlier
this
week
we
learned
that
the
economy
has
been
in
recession
since
december
of
and
that
our
manufacturing
output
is
at
year
low
two
stark
reminders
of
the
magnitude
of
the
challenges
we
face
but
while
know
rebuilding
our
economy
be
easy
and
it
be
happen
overnight
also
know
this
that
right
now
somewhere
in
america
small
business
is
at
work
with
the
next
big
idea
scientist
is
on
the
cusp
of
the
next
big
breakthrough
discovery
an
entrepreneur
is
sketching
plans
for
the
startup
that
will
an
industry
right
now
across
america
the
finest
products
in
the
world
are
rolling
off
our
assembly
lines
and
the
proudest
most
determined
most
productive
workers
in
the
world
are
on
the
job
some
already
on
their
second
shift
of
the
day
many
putting
in
longer
hours
than
ever
before
after
nearly
two
years
of
across
this
country
meeting
with
workers
visiting
businesses
large
and
small
am
more
confident
than
ever
that
we
have
everything
we
need
to
renew
our
economy
we
got
the
ingenuity
the
technology
the
skill
and
commitment
we
just
need
to
put
it
to
work
time
to
not
just
address
the
immediate
economic
threats
but
to
start
laying
the
groundwork
for
prosperity
to
help
american
businesses
grow
and
thrive
at
home
and
expand
our
efforts
to
promote
american
enterprise
around
the
world
this
work
is
the
core
mission
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
with
his
breadth
and
depth
of
experience
in
public
life
governor
is
uniquely
suited
for
this
role
as
leading
economic
diplomat
for
america
during
his
time
in
state
government
and
congress
and
in
tour
two
tours
of
duty
in
the
cabinet
bill
has
seen
from
just
about
every
angle
what
makes
our
economy
work
and
what
keeps
it
from
working
better
as
governor
of
new
mexico
bill
showed
how
government
can
act
as
partner
to
support
our
businesses
helping
to
create
new
jobs
and
under
his
leadership
new
mexico
saw
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
in
decades
as
former
secretary
of
energy
bill
understands
the
steps
we
must
take
to
build
new
industry
and
create
the
green
jobs
of
the
century
jobs
that
pay
well
and
be
jobs
that
will
help
us
end
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
as
former
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
bill
brings
both
international
stature
and
deep
understanding
of
global
economy
he
understands
that
the
success
of
business
in
detroit
or
columbus
often
depends
on
whether
it
can
sell
products
in
places
like
santiago
or
and
he
knows
that
reputation
in
the
world
is
critical
not
just
to
our
security
but
to
our
prosperity
excuse
me
that
when
the
citizens
of
the
world
respect
leadership
they
are
more
likely
to
buy
products
to
this
crucial
work
of
restoring
international
standing
bill
will
bring
leadership
style
all
his
own
bill
has
never
been
content
to
just
learn
from
briefing
books
never
satisfied
with
only
the
official
version
of
the
story
during
his
time
in
congress
he
held
more
than
two
meetings
so
he
could
hear
directly
from
constituents
he
was
regular
in
the
cafeteria
mixing
it
up
with
employees
over
lunch
and
during
his
campaign
for
record
for
governor
he
actually
broke
world
record
by
shaking
nearly
hands
in
just
eight
hours
got
to
check
that
statistic
all
of
this
reflects
determination
to
reach
out
and
understand
where
people
are
coming
from
what
they
hope
for
and
what
he
can
do
to
help
this
approach
believe
has
been
the
key
to
success
as
negotiator
and
will
be
key
to
his
work
on
the
critical
functions
of
the
commerce
department
from
administering
our
census
and
monitoring
our
climate
to
protecting
our
intellectual
property
and
restoring
our
economic
diplomacy
in
the
end
bill
is
leader
who
shares
my
values
and
he
must
and
he
will
be
measured
his
progress
the
same
way
do
are
we
creating
good
jobs
instead
of
losing
them
are
incomes
growing
instead
of
shrinking
know
bill
will
be
an
unyielding
advocate
for
american
business
and
american
jobs
at
home
and
around
the
world
and
look
forward
to
working
with
him
in
the
years
ahead
good
morning
everybody
hope
you
all
had
wonderful
thanksgiving
last
week
we
announced
our
economic
team
which
is
working
as
we
speak
to
craft
an
economic
recovery
program
to
create
jobs
and
grow
our
struggling
economy
today
vice
and
are
pleased
to
announce
our
national
security
team
the
national
security
challenges
we
face
are
just
as
grave
and
just
as
urgent
as
our
economic
crisis
we
are
fighting
two
wars
our
old
conflicts
remain
unresolved
and
newly
assertive
powers
have
put
strains
on
the
international
system
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
raises
the
peril
that
the
deadliest
technologies
could
fall
into
dangerous
hands
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
empowers
authoritarian
governments
and
endangers
our
planet
america
must
also
be
strong
at
home
to
be
strong
abroad
we
need
to
provide
education
and
opportunity
to
all
our
citizens
so
every
american
can
compete
with
anyone
anywhere
and
our
economic
power
must
sustain
our
military
strength
our
diplomatic
leverage
and
our
global
leadership
the
common
thread
linking
these
challenges
is
the
fundamental
reality
that
in
the
century
our
destiny
is
shared
with
the
world
from
our
markets
to
our
security
from
our
public
health
to
our
climate
we
must
act
with
the
understanding
that
now
more
than
ever
we
have
stake
in
what
happens
across
the
globe
and
as
we
learned
so
painfully
on
terror
can
not
be
contained
by
borders
nor
safety
provided
by
oceans
alone
last
week
we
were
reminded
of
this
threat
once
again
when
terrorists
took
the
lives
of
six
american
among
nearly
victims
in
in
the
world
we
seek
there
is
no
place
for
those
who
kill
innocent
civilians
to
advance
hateful
extremism
this
weekend
told
prime
minister
of
india
that
americans
stand
with
the
people
of
india
in
this
dark
time
and
am
confident
that
india
great
democracy
is
more
resilient
than
killers
who
would
tear
it
down
and
so
in
this
uncertain
world
the
time
has
come
for
new
beginning
new
dawn
of
american
leadership
to
overcome
the
challenges
of
the
century
and
to
seize
the
opportunities
embedded
in
those
challenges
we
will
strengthen
our
capacity
to
defeat
our
enemies
and
support
our
friends
we
will
renew
old
alliances
and
forge
new
and
enduring
partnerships
we
will
show
the
world
once
more
that
america
is
relentless
in
the
of
our
people
steady
in
advancing
our
interests
and
committed
to
the
ideals
that
shine
as
beacon
to
the
world
democracy
and
justice
opportunity
and
unyielding
hope
because
american
values
are
greatest
export
to
the
world
to
succeed
we
must
pursue
new
strategy
that
uses
balances
and
integrates
all
elements
of
american
power
our
military
and
diplomacy
our
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
our
economy
and
the
power
of
our
moral
example
the
team
that
we
assembled
here
today
is
uniquely
suited
to
do
just
that
in
their
past
service
and
plans
for
the
future
these
men
and
women
represent
all
of
those
elements
of
american
power
and
the
very
best
of
the
american
example
they
served
in
uniform
and
as
diplomats
they
have
worked
as
legislators
law
enforcement
officials
and
executives
they
share
my
pragmatism
about
the
use
of
power
and
my
sense
of
purpose
about
america
role
as
leader
in
the
world
have
known

friend
colleague

of
counsel

as
campaign
opponent

possesses
an
extraordinary
intelligence

remarkable
work
ethic

proud
that
she
will
be
our
next
secretary
of
state
she
is
an
american
of
tremendous
stature
who
will
have
my
complete
confidence
who
knows
many
of
the
world
leaders
who
will
command
respect
in
every
capitol
and
who
will
clearly
have
the
ability
to
advance
our
interests
around
the
world
appointment
is
sign
to
friend
and
foe
of
the
seriousness
of
my
commitment
to
renew
american
diplomacy
and
restore
our
alliances
there
is
much
to
do
from
preventing
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
to
iran
and
north
korea
to
seeking
lasting
peace
between
israel
and
the
to
strengthening
international
institutions

no
doubt
that

the
right
person

lead
our
state
department

this
ambitious
foreign
policy
agenda

the
aisle

his
pragmatism

some
of
the
challenges
that
we
face
in
the
months

years

to
make
sure
that
we
are
ready
to
hit
the
ground
running

the
range

threats
that

the
vulnerability
that

for
those
national
security
officials

demand
confirmation

move
forward
with
the
humility
that
comes
with
knowing
that
there
are
brave
men
and
women
protecting
us
on
our
front
lines
diplomats
and
intelligence
officers
in
dangerous
corners
of
the
world
troops

or
fourth
tours
agents

prosecutors

cargo
inspectors
at

ports
these
selfless
americans
whose
names

form
the
backbone

our
effort
if
we
serve
as
well
as
they
are
serving
we
will
protect
our
country
and
promote
our
values
and
as
we
move
forward
with
respect
for
america
tradition
of
bipartisan
national
security
policy
and
commitment
to
national
unity
we
have
to
recall
that
when
it
comes
to
keeping
our
nation
and
our
people
safe
we
are
not
republicans
or
democrats
we
are
americans
there
no
monopoly
of
power
or
wisdom
in
either
party
together
as
one
nation
as
one
people
we
can
shape
our
times
instead
of
being
shaped
by
them
together
we
will
meet
the
challenges
of
the
century
not
with
fear
but
with
hope
please
be
seated
good
morning
everybody
yesterday
we
talked
about
the
need
to
our
economy
speak
to
you
today
mindful
that
we
meet
at
moment
of
great
challenge
for
america
as
our
credit
markets
are
stressed
and
our
families
are
struggling
but
as
difficult
as
these
times
are
confident
that
we
going
to
rise
to
meet
this
challenge
if
willing
to
band
together
and
that
wall
street
can
not
thrive
so
long
as
main
street
is
struggling
if
willing
to
summon
new
spirit
of
ingenuity
and
determination
and
if
americans
of
great
intellect
broad
experience
and
good
character
are
willing
to
serve
in
our
government
at
its
hour
of
need
yesterday
announced
four
such
americans
to
help
lead
the
economic
team
that
will
advise
me
as
we
seek
to
climb
out
of
this
crisis
today
pleased
to
announce
two
other
key
members
of
our
team
peter
as
director
and
as
deputy
director
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
before
explain
why
selected
these
outstanding
public
servants
let
me
say
few
words
about
the
work
that
asking
them
to
undertake
as
said
yesterday
the
economic
crisis
we
face
demands
that
we
invest
immediately
in
series
of
measures
that
will
help
save
or
create
two
and
half
million
jobs
and
put
tax
cuts
in
the
pockets
of
the
middle
class
many
of
those
new
jobs
will
come
in
areas
such
as
energy
independence
technology
and
health
care
that
will
strengthen
our
economy
over
the
long
term
but
if
we
are
going
to
make
the
investments
we
need
we
also
have
to
be
willing
to
shed
the
spending
that
we
need
in
these
challenging
times
when
we
facing
both
rising
deficits
and
shrinking
economy
budget
reform
is
not
an
option
it
necessity
we
sustain
system
that
bleeds
billions
of
taxpayer
dollars
on
programs
that
have
outlived
their
usefulness
or
exist
solely
because
of
the
power
of
politicians
lobbyists
or
interest
groups
we
simply
afford
it
this
about
big
government
or
small
government
about
building
smarter
government
that
focuses
on
what
works
that
why
will
ask
my
new
team
to
think
anew
and
act
anew
to
meet
our
new
challenges
we
are
going
to
go
through
our
federal
budget
as
promised
during
the
campaign
page
by
page
line
by
line
eliminating
those
programs
we
need
and
insisting
that
those
that
we
do
need
operate
in
sensible
way
let
me
just
give
you
one
example
of
what
talking
about
report
today
from
that
from
to
millionaire
farmers
received
million
dollars
in
crop
subsidies
even
though
they
were
earning
more
than
the
million
for
such
subsidies
now
if
this
is
true
and
this
was
just
report
this
morning
but
if
it
true
it
is
prime
example
of
the
kind
of
waste
that
intend
to
end
as
president
we
also
going
to
focus
on
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
that
our
budget
faces
namely
the
rising
cost
of
health
care
in
both
the
public
and
private
sectors
this
is
not
just
challenge
but
also
an
opportunity
to
improve
the
health
care
that
americans
rely
on
and
to
bring
down
the
costs
that
taxpayers
businesses
and
families
have
to
pay
now
that
what
the
office
of
management
and
budget
will
do
in
my
administration
it
will
not
only
help
design
budget
and
manage
its
implementation
but
it
also
going
to
make
sure
that
our
government
your
government
is
more
efficient
and
more
effective
at
serving
the
american
people
and
there
is
no
better
person
to
help
lead
this
effort
as
director
of
the
than
my
friend
peter
peter
been
one
of
our
leading
voices
on
budgetary
issues
it
said
that
budget
reflects
its
values
and
its
priorities
believe
that
true
and
know
that
peter
will
bring
to
his
work
at
the
set
of
priorities
that
and
the
american
people
share
throughout
his
career
he
made
significant
contributions
in
our
understanding
of
all
the
major
economic
challenges
that
we
now
confronting
from
reducing
medical
costs
to
saving
social
security
to
fighting
global
climate
change
to
helping
put
the
dream
of
college
degree
within
the
reach
for
more
students
as
director
of
the
congressional
budget
office
he
and
reinvigorated
the
agency
while
shifting
its
focus
to
confront
the
health
care
crisis
that
is
not
only
cause
of
so
much
suffering
for
so
many
families
but
rapidly
growing
portion
of
our
budget
and
drag
on
our
entire
economy
but
it
not
simply
that
past
career
makes
him
qualified
for
this
new
appointment
it
also
that
he
has
vision
for
the
future
that
share
he
believes
as
do
that
even
as
we
take
steps
to
restore
discipline
to
our
budget
we
also
have
to
take
take
the
steps
right
now
that
are
necessary
to
solve
our
immediate
crisis
peter
need
map
to
tell
him
where
the
bodies
are
buried
in
the
federal
budget
he
knows
what
works
and
what
what
worthy
of
our
precious
tax
dollars
and
what
is
not
just
because
program
special
interest
tax
break
or
corporate
subsidy
is
hidden
in
this
budget
does
not
mean
that
it
will
survive
the
next
the
old
ways
of
washington
simply
meet
the
challenges
of
today
and
tomorrow
and
no
one
more
able
or
more
qualified
to
assist
peter
in
this
work
than
deputy
director
of
the
that
am
nominating
rob
will
bring
to
this
post
experience
in
the
executive
branch
at
the
where
he
helped
the
administration
achieve
balanced
budgets
as
well
as
in
the
legislative
branch
where
he
led
the
appropriations
committee
staff
as
driving
force
for
responsible
budget
together
peter
and
rob
will
help
steer
our
budget
through
congress
so
that
can
sign
it
into
law
now
let
me
be
clear
these
appointments
as
well
as
the
appointments
that
announced
yesterday
are
not
the
sum
of
my
economic
team
these
appointments
are
going
to
work
closely
with
those
that
have
not
ye
announced
those
including
the
secretaries
of
energy
and
commerce
and
health
and
human
services
as
well
as
others
in
my
administration
to
design
recovery
path
for
both
wall
street
and
main
street
and
to
put
our
economy
on
path
to
growth
and
prosperity
because
at
this
moment
we
must
not
only
restore
confidence
in
our
markets
we
also
must
restore
the
confidence
of
middle
class
families
that
their
government
is
on
their
side
that
working
for
them
and
on
their
behalf
to
meet
their
needs
that
what
intend
to
do
as
president
of
the
united
states
the
news
this
past
week
including
this
news
about
has
made
it
even
more
clear
that
we
are
facing
an
economic
crisis
of
historic
proportions
our
financial
markets
are
under
stress
new
home
purchases
in
october
were
the
lowest
in
recently
more
than
jobless
claims
were
filed
the
highest
in
years
and
if
we
do
not
act
swiftly
and
boldly
most
experts
now
believe
that
we
could
lose
millions
of
jobs
next
year
while
we
underestimate
the
challenges
that
we
face
we
also
underestimate
our
capacity
to
overcome
them
to
summon
that
spirit
of
determination
and
optimism
that
has
always
defined
us
and
to
move
forward
in
new
direction
to
create
new
jobs
reform
our
financial
system
and
fuel
economic
growth
we
know
this
be
easy
and
it
happen
overnight
need
to
bring
together
the
best
minds
in
america
to
guide
us
and
that
is
what
sought
to
do
in
assembling
my
economic
team
sought
leaders
who
could
offer
both
sound
judgment
and
fresh
thinking
both
depth
of
experience
and
wealth
of
bold
new
ideas
and
most
of
all
who
share
my
fundamental
belief
that
we
can
not
have
thriving
wall
street
without
thriving
main
street
that
in
this
country
we
rise
or
fall
as
one
nation
as
one
people
today
vice
and
are

fit
for
director
grateful
that
and
melody
have
accepted
my
nomination
and
am
looking
forward
to
working
closely
with
them
in
the
months
ahead
that
work
starts
today
because
the
truth
is
we
do
not
have
minute
to
waste
right
now
our
economy
is
trapped
in
vicious
cycle
the
turmoil
on
wall
street
means
new
round
of
for
families
and
businesses
on
main
street
and
as
folks
produce
less
and
consume
less
that
just
deepens
the
problems
in
our
financial
markets
these
extraordinary
stresses
on
our
financial
system
require
extraordinary
policy
responses
and
my
administration
will
the
public
commitments
made
by
the
current
administration
to
address
this
crisis
further
beyond
any
immediate
actions
we
may
take
we
need
recovery
plan
for
both
wall
street
and
main
street
plan
that
our
financial
system
and
gets
credit
flowing
again
while
at
the
same
time
addressing
our
growing
foreclosure
crisis
helping
our
struggling
auto
industry
and
creating
and
saving
million
jobs
jobs
rebuilding
our
infrastructure
our
roads
our
bridges
our
schools
and
creating
the
clean
energy
infrastructure
of
the
century
because
at
this
moment
we
need
to
restore
both
confidence
in
the
markets
and
restore
confidence
of
families
who
find
themselves
working
harder
earning
less
and
falling
further
and
further
behind
asked
my
economic
team
to
develop
recommendations
for
this
plan
and
to
consult
with
congress
the
current
administration
and
the
federal
reserve
on
immediate
economic
developments
over
the
next
two
months
requested
that
they
brief
me
on
these
matters
on
daily
basis
and
in
the
coming
weeks
will
provide
the
american
people
and
the
incoming
congress
with
an
overview
of
their
initial
recommendations
it
is
my
hope
that
the
new
congress
will
begin
work
on
an
aggressive
economic
recovery
plan
when
they
convene
in
early
january
so
that
our
administration
can
hit
the
ground
running
with
our
economy
in
distress
we
can
not
hesitate
and
we
can
not
delay
our
families
afford
to
keep
on
waiting
and
hoping
for
solution
they
afford
to
watch
another
month
of
unpaid
bills
pile
up
another
semester
of
tuition
slip
out
of
reach
another
month
where
instead
of
saving
for
retirement
dipping
into
their
savings
just
to
get
by
and
want
to
repeat
this
will
not
be
easy
there
are
no
shortcuts
or
quick
fixes
to
this
crisis
which
has
been
many
years
in
the
making
and
the
economy
is
likely
to
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
full
recovery
will
not
happen
immediately
and
to
make
the
investments
we
need
have
to
scour
our
federal
budget
line
by
line
and
make
meaningful
cuts
and
sacrifices
as
well
something
be
discussing
further
tomorrow
despite
all
of
this
am
hopeful
about
the
future
have
full
confidence
in
the
wisdom
and
ingenuity
of
my
economic
team
and
in
the
hard
work
courage
and
sacrifice
of
the
american
people
and
most
of
all
believe
deeply
in
the
resilience
and
the
spirit
of
this
nation
know
we
can
work
our
way
out
of
this
crisis
because
done
it
before
and
know
we
will
succeed
once
again
if
we
put
aside
partisanship
and
politics
and
work
together
exactly
what
intend
to
do
as
president
of
the
united
states
let
me
begin
by
thanking
the
bipartisan
group
of
governors
who
convened
this
meeting
few
challenges
facing
america
and
the
world
are
more
urgent
than
combating
climate
change
the
science
is
beyond
dispute
and
the
facts
are
clear
sea
levels
are
rising
coastlines
are
shrinking
seen
record
drought
spreading
famine
and
storms
that
are
growing
stronger
with
each
passing
hurricane
season
climate
change
and
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
if
left
unaddressed
will
continue
to
weaken
our
economy
and
threaten
our
national
security
know
many
of
you
are
working
to
confront
this
challenge
in
particular
want
to
commend
governor
governor
governor
governor
and
your
host
governor
all
of
you
have
shown
true
leadership
in
the
fight
to
combat
global
warming
and
also
seen
number
of
businesses
doing
their
part
by
investing
in
clean
energy
technologies
but
too
often
washington
has
failed
to
show
the
same
kind
of
leadership
that
will
change
when
take
office
my
presidency
will
mark
new
chapter
in
leadership
on
climate
change
that
will
strengthen
our
security
and
create
millions
of
new
jobs
in
the
process
that
will
start
with
federal
cap
and
trade
system
we
establish
strong
annual
targets
that
set
us
on
course
to
reduce
emissions
to
their
levels
by
and
reduce
them
an
additional
by
further
we
invest
billion
dollars
each
year
to
private
sector
efforts
to
build
clean
energy
future
we
invest
in
solar
power
wind
power
and
we
tap
nuclear
power
while
making
sure
safe
and
we
develop
clean
coal
technologies
this
investment
will
not
only
help
us
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
making
the
united
states
more
secure
and
it
will
not
only
help
us
bring
about
clean
energy
future
saving
the
planet
it
will
also
help
us
transform
our
industries
and
steer
our
country
out
of
this
economic
crisis
by
generating
five
million
new
green
jobs
that
pay
well
and
be
the
truth
is
the
united
states
meet
this
challenge
alone
solving
this
problem
will
require
all
of
us
working
together
understand
that
your
meeting
is
being
attended
by
government
officials
from
over
dozen
countries
including
the
canada
mexico
brazil
and
poland
and
india
and
and
look
forward
to
working
with
all
nations
to
meet
this
challenge
in
the
coming
years
let
me
also
say
special
word
to
the
delegates
from
around
the
world
who
will
gather
at
poland
next
month
your
work
is
vital
to
the
planet
while
be
president
at
the
time
of
your
meeting
and
while
the
united
states
has
only
one
president
at
time
asked
members
of
congress
who
are
attending
the
conference
as
observers
to
report
back
to
me
on
what
they
learn
there
and
once
take
office
you
can
be
sure
that
the
united
states
will
once
again
engage
vigorously
in
these
negotiations
and
help
lead
the
world
toward
new
era
of
global
cooperation
on
climate
change
now
is
the
time
to
confront
this
challenge
once
and
for
all
delay
is
no
longer
an
option
denial
is
no
longer
an
acceptable
response
the
stakes
are
too
high
the
consequences
too
serious
stopping
climate
change
be
easy
and
it
happen
overnight
but
promise
you
this
when
am
president
any
governor
willing
to
promote
clean
energy
will
have
partner
in
the
white
house
any
company
willing
to
invest
in
clean
energy
will
have
an
ally
in
washington
and
any
nation
willing
to
join
the
cause
of
combating
climate
change
will
have
an
ally
in
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
this
morning
we
woke
up
to
more
sobering
news
about
the
state
of
our
economy
the
jobs
lost
in
october
marks
the
consecutive
month
that
our
economy
has
shed
jobs
in
total
we
lost
nearly
million
jobs
this
year
and
more
than
million
americans
are
now
unemployed
tens
of
millions
of
families
are
struggling
to
figure
out
how
to
pay
the
bills
and
stay
in
their
homes
their
stories
are
an
urgent
reminder
that
we
are
facing
the
greatest
economic
challenge
of
our
lifetime
and
we
going
to
have
to
act
swiftly
to
resolve
it
now
the
united
states
has
only
one
government
and
one
president
at
time
and
until
january
of
next
year
that
government
is
the
current
administration
spoken
to
president
bush
appreciate
his
commitment
to
ensuring
that
his
economic
policy
team
keeps
us
fully
informed
as
developments
unfold
and
also
thankful
for
his
invitation
to
the
white
house
immediately
after
become
president
going
to
confront
this
economic
crisis
by
taking
all
necessary
steps
to
ease
the
credit
crisis
help
hardworking
families
and
restore
growth
and
prosperity
this
morning
met
with
members
of
my
transition
economic
advisory
board
who
are
standing
behind
me
alongside
my
vice
they
will
help
to
guide
the
work
of
my
transition
team
working
with
my
chief
of
staff
in
developing
strong
set
of
policies
to
respond
to
this
crisis
we
discussed
in
the
earlier
meeting
several
of
the
most
immediate
challenges
facing
our
economy
and
key
priorities
on
which
to
focus
on
in
the
days
and
weeks
ahead
first
of
all
we
need
rescue
plan
for
the
middle
class
that
invests
in
immediate
efforts
to
create
jobs
and
provide
relief
to
families
that
are
watching
their
shrink
and
their
life
savings
disappear
particularly
urgent
priority
is
further
extension
of
of
unemployment
insurance
benefits
for
workers
who
can
not
find
work
in
the
increasingly
weak
economy
fiscal
stimulus
plan
that
will
economic
growth
is
long
overdue
talked
about
it
throughout
this
the
last
few
months
of
the
campaign
we
should
get
it
done
second
we
have
to
address
the
spreading
impact
of
the
financial
crisis
on
the
other
sectors
of
our
economy
small
businesses
that
are
struggling
to
meet
their
payrolls
and
finance
their
holiday
inventories
and
state
and
municipal
governments
facing
devastating
budget
cuts
and
tax
increases
we
must
also
remember
that
the
financial
crisis
is
increasingly
global
and
requires
global
response
the
news
coming
out
of
the
auto
industry
this
week
reminds
us
of
the
hardship
it
faces
hardship
that
goes
far
beyond
individual
auto
companies
to
the
countless
suppliers
small
businesses
and
communities
throughout
our
nation
who
depend
on
vibrant
american
auto
industry
the
auto
industry
is
the
backbone
of
american
manufacturing
and
critical
part
of
our
attempt
to
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
would
like
to
see
the
administration
do
everything
it
can
to
accelerate
the
assistance
that
congress
has
already
enacted
in
addition
have
made
it
high
priority
for
my
transition
team
to
work
on
additional
policy
options
to
help
the
auto
industry
adjust
weather
the
financial
crisis
and
succeed
in
producing
cars
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
was
glad
to
be
joined
today
by
governor
who
obviously
has
great
knowledge
and
great
interest
on
this
issue
asked
my
team
to
explore
what
we
can
do
under
current
law
and
whether
additional
legislation
will
be
needed
for
this
purpose
third
we
will
review
the
implementation
of
this
administration
financial
program
to
ensure
that
the
government
efforts
are
achieving
their
central
goal
of
financial
markets
while
protecting
taxpayers
helping
homeowners
and
not
unduly
rewarding
the
management
of
financial
firms
that
are
receiving
government
assistance
it
is
absolutely
critical
that
the
treasury
work
closely
with
the
and
other
government
agencies
to
use
the
substantial
authority
that
they
already
have
to
help
families
avoid
foreclosure
and
stay
in
their
homes
finally
as
we
monitor
and
address
these
immediate
economic
challenges
we
will
be
moving
forward
in
laying
out
set
of
policies
that
will
grow
our
middle
class
and
strengthen
our
economy
in
the
long
term
we
can
not
afford
to
wait
on
moving
forward
on
the
key
priorities
that
identified
during
the
campaign
including
clean
energy
health
care
education
and
tax
relief
for
families
my
transition
team
will
be
working
on
each
of
these
priorities
in
the
weeks
ahead
and
intend
to
reconvene
this
advisory
board
to
discuss
the
best
ideas
for
responding
to
these
immediate
problems
let
me
close
by
saying
this
do
not
underestimate
the
enormity
of
the
task
that
lies
ahead
we
have
taken
some
major
action
to
date
and
we
will
need
further
action
during
this
transition
and
subsequent
months
some
of
the
choices
that
we
make
are
going
to
be
difficult
and
have
said
before
and
will
repeat
again
it
is
not
going
to
be
quick
and
it
is
not
going
to
be
easy
for
us
to
dig
ourselves
out
of
the
hole
that
we
are
in
but
america
is
strong
and
resilient
country
and
know
we
will
succeed
if
we
put
aside
partisanship
and
politics
and
work
together
as
one
nation
that
what
intend
to
do
hello
chicago
if
there
is
anyone
out
there
who
still
doubts
that
america
is
place
where
all
things
are
possible
who
still
wonders
if
the
dream
of
our
founders
is
alive
in
our
time
who
still
questions
the
power
of
our
democracy
tonight
is
your
answer
it
the
answer
told
by
lines
that
stretched
around
schools
and
churches
in
numbers
this
nation
has
never
seen
by
people
who
waited
three
hours
and
four
hours
many
for
the
very
first
time
in
their
lives
because
they
believed
that
this
time
must
be
different
that
their
voices
could
be
that
difference
it
the
answer
spoken
by
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
democrat
and
republican
black
white
hispanic
asian
native
american
gay
straight
disabled
and
not
disabled
americans
who
sent
message
to
the
world
that
we
have
never
been
just
collection
of
individuals
or
collection
of
red
states
and
blue
states
we
are
and
always
will
be
the
united
states
of
america
it
the
answer
that
that
led
those
who
have
been
told
for
so
long
by
so
many
to
be
cynical
and
fearful
and
doubtful
about
what
we
can
achieve
to
put
their
hands
on
the
arc
of
history
and
bend
it
once
more
toward
the
hope
of
better
day
it
been
long
time
coming
but
tonight
because
of
what
we
did
on
this
day
in
this
election
at
this
defining
moment
change
has
come
to
america
little
bit
earlier
this
evening
received
an
extraordinarily
gracious
call
from
senator

long
and
hard
in
this
campaign
and
he
fought
even
longer
and
harder
for
the
country
that
he
loves
he
has
endured
sacrifices
for
america
that
most
of
us
can
not
begin
to
imagine
we
are
better
off
for
the
service
rendered
by
this
brave
and
selfless
leader

this
victory
truly
belongs
to

belongs
to
you
it
belongs
to
you
was
never
the
likeliest
candidate
for
this
office
we
did
start
with
much
money
or
many
endorsements
our
campaign
was
not
hatched
in
the
halls
of
washington
it
began
in
the
of
and
the
living
rooms
of
concord
and
the
front
porches
of
it
was
built
by
working
men
and
women
who
dug
into
what
little
savings
they
had
to
give
dollars
and
dollars
and
dollars
to
the
cause
it
grew
strength
from
the
young
people
who
rejected
the
myth
of
their
generation
apathy
who
left
their
homes
and
their
families
for
jobs
that
offered
little
pay
and
less
sleep
it
drew
strength
from
the
people
who
braved
the
bitter
cold
and
scorching
heat
to
knock
on
doors
of
perfect
strangers
and
from
the
millions
of
americans
who
volunteered
and
and
proved
that
more
than
two
centuries
later
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
has
not
perished
from
the
earth
this
is
your
victory
and
know
you
did
do
this
just
to
win
an
election
and
know
you
did
do
it
for
me
you
did
it
because
you
understand
the
enormity
of
the
task
that
lies
ahead
for
even
as
we
celebrate
tonight
we
know
the
challenges
that
tomorrow
will
bring
are
the
greatest
of
our
lifetime
two
wars
planet
in
peril
the
worst
financial
crisis
in
century
even
as
we
stand
here
tonight
we
know
there
are
brave
americans
waking
up
in
the
deserts
of
iraq
and
the
mountains
of
to
risk
their
lives
for
us
there
are
mothers
and
fathers
who
will
lie
awake
after
the
children
fall
asleep
and
wonder
how
they
make
the
mortgage
or
pay
their
doctors
bills
or
save
enough
for
their
child
college
education
there
new
energy
to
harness
new
jobs
to
be
created
new
schools
to
build
and
threats
to
meet
alliances
to
repair
the
road
ahead
will
be
long
our
climb
will
be
steep
we
may
not
get
there
in
one
year
or
even
in
one
term
but
america
have
never
been
more
hopeful
than
am
tonight
that
we
will
get
there
promise
you
we
as
people
will
get
there
there
will
be
setbacks
and
false
starts
there
are
many
who
agree
with
every
decision
or
policy
make
as
president
and
we
know
the
government
solve
every
problem
but
will
always
be
honest
with
you
about
the
challenges
we
face
will
listen
to
you
especially
when
we
disagree
and
above
all
will
ask
you
to
join
in
the
work
of
remaking
this
nation
the
only
way
it
been
done
in
america
for
years
block
by
block
brick
by
brick
calloused
hand
by
calloused
hand
what
began
months
ago
in
the
depths
of
winter
can
not
end
on
this
autumn
night
this
victory
alone
is
not
the
change
we
seek
it
is
only
the
chance
for
us
to
make
that
change
and
that
can
not
happen
if
we
go
back
to
the
way
things
were
it
happen
without
you
without
new
spirit
of
service
new
spirit
of
sacrifice
so
let
us
summon
new
spirit
of
patriotism
of
responsibility
where
each
of
us
resolves
to
pitch
in
and
work
harder
and
look
after
not
only
ourselves
but
each
other
let
us
remember
that
if
this
financial
crisis
taught
us
anything
it
that
we
can
not
have
thriving
wall
street
while
main
street
suffers
in
this
country
we
rise
or
fall
as
one
nation
as
one
people
let
resist
the
temptation
to
fall
back
on
the
same
partisanship
and
pettiness
and
immaturity
that
has
poisoned
our
politics
for
so
long
let
remember
that
it
was
man
from
this
state
who
first
carried
the
banner
of
the
republican
party
to
the
white
house
party
founded
on
the
values
of
and
individual
liberty
and
national
unity
those
are
values
that
we
all
share
and
while
the
democratic
party
has
won
great
victory
tonight
we
do
so
with
measure
of
humility
and
determination
to
heal
the
divides
that
have
held
back
our
progress
as
lincoln
said
to
nation
far
more
divided
than
ours
we
are
not
enemies
but
friends
though
passion
may
have
strained
it
must
not
break
our
bonds
of
affection
and
to
those
americans
who
whose
support
have
yet
to
earn
may
not
have
won
your
vote
tonight
but
hear
your
voices
need
your
help
and
will
be
your
president
too
and
to
all
those
watching
tonight
from
beyond
our
shores
from
parliaments
and
palaces
to
those
who
are
huddled
around
radios
in
the
forgotten
corners
of
the
world
our
stories
are
singular
but
our
destiny
is
shared
and
new
dawn
of
american
leadership
is
at
hand
to
those
to
those
who
would
tear
the
world
down
we
will
defeat
you
to
those
who
seek
peace
and
security
we
support
you
and
to
all
those
who
have
wondered
if
america
beacon
still
burns
as
bright
tonight
we
proved
once
more
that
the
true
strength
of
our
nation
comes
not
from
the
might
of
our
arms
or
the
scale
of
our
wealth
but
from
the
enduring
power
of
our
ideals
democracy
liberty
opportunity
and
unyielding
hope
that
the
true
genius
of
america
that
america
can
change
our
union
can
be
perfected
what
we
already
achieved
gives
us
hope
for
what
we
can
and
must
achieve
tomorrow
this
election
had
many
firsts
and
many
stories
that
will
be
told
for
generations
but
one
that
on
my
mind
tonight
about
woman
who
cast
her
ballot
in
atlanta
she
lot
like
the
millions
of
others
who
stood
in
line
to
make
their
voice
heard
in
this
election
except
for
one
thing
nixon
cooper
is
years
old
she
was
born
just
generation
past
slavery
time
when
there
were
no
cars
on
the
road
or
planes
in
the
sky
when
someone
like
her
could
vote
for
two
reasons
because
she
was
woman
and
because
of
the
of
her
skin
and
tonight
think
about
all
that
she
seen
throughout
her
century
in
america
the
heartache
and
the
hope
the
struggle
and
the
progress
the
times
we
were
told
that
we
and
the
people
who
pressed
on
with
that
american
creed
yes
we
can
at
time
when
women
voices
were
silenced
and
their
hopes
dismissed
she
lived
to
see
them
stand
up
and
speak
out
and
reach
for
the
ballot
yes
we
can
when
there
was
despair
in
the
dust
bowl
and
depression
across
the
land
she
saw
nation
conquer
fear
itself
with
new
deal
new
jobs
new
sense
of
common
purpose
yes
we
can
when
the
bombs
fell
on
our
and
tyranny
threatened
the
world
she
was
there
to
witness
generation
rise
to
greatness
and
democracy
was
saved
yes
we
can
she
was
there
for
the
buses
in
the
hoses
in
bridge
in
and
preacher
from
atlanta
who
told
people
that
we
shall
overcome
yes
we
can
man
touched
down
on
the
moon
wall
came
down
in
berlin
world
was
connected
by
our
own
science
and
imagination
and
this
year
in
this
election
she
touched
her
finger
to
screen
and
cast
her
vote
because
after
years
in
america
through
the
best
of
times
and
the
darkest
of
hours
she
knows
how
america
can
change
yes
we
can
america
we
have
come
so
far
we
have
seen
so
much
but
there
is
so
much
more
to
do
so
tonight
let
us
ask
ourselves
if
our
children
should
live
to
see
the
next
century
if
my
daughters
should
be
so
lucky
to
live
as
long
as
nixon
cooper
what
change
will
they
see
what
progress
will
we
have
made
this
is
our
chance
to
answer
that
call
this
is
our
moment
this
is
our
time
to
put
our
people
back
to
work
and
open
doors
of
opportunity
for
our
kids
to
restore
prosperity
and
promote
the
cause
of
peace
to
reclaim
the
american
dream
and
reaffirm
that
fundamental
truth
that
out
of
many
we
are
one
that
while
we
breathe
we
hope
and
where
we
are
met
with
cynicism
and
doubt
and
those
who
tell
us
that
we
we
will
respond
with
that
timeless
creed
that
sums
up
the
spirit
of
people
yes
we
can
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
madam
president
and
thank
you
to
the
distinguished
senator
from
not
only
for
yielding
time
but
also
for
the
extraordinarily
hard
work
that
he
put
in
over
the
last
several
days
and
in
fact
over
week
and
want
to
thank
his
counterparts
on
the
other
side
including
senator
for
their
hard
work
now
the
fact
that
we
even
here
voting
on
plan
to
rescue
our
economy
from
the
greed
and
irresponsibility
of
wall
street
and
some
in
washington
is
an
outrage
it
an
outrage
to
every
american
who
works
hard
pays
their
taxes
is
doing
their
best
every
day
to
make
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families
and
understandably
people
are
frustrated
and
they
angry
that
wall
street
mistakes
have
put
their
tax
dollars
at
risk
and
they
should
be
frustrated
and
angry
too
but
while
there
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around
and
many
in
washington
and
wall
street
who
deserve
it
all
of
us
all
of
us
have
responsibility
to
solve
this
crisis
because
it
affects
the
financial
of
every
single
american
there
will
be
time
to
punish
those
who
set
this
fire
but
now
is
not
the
time
to
argue
about
how
it
got
set
or
did
the
sleep
in
his
bed
or
leave
the
stove
on
right
now
we
want
to
put
out
that
fire
and
now
the
time
for
us
to
come
together
and
do
that
when
the
house
of
representatives
failed
to
act
on
monday
we
saw
the
single
largest
decline
in
the
stock
market
in
two
decades
over
one
trillion
dollars
of
wealth
was
lost
by
the
time
the
markets
closed
and
it
was
just
the
wealth
of
few
or
wall
street
executives
the
and
retirement
accounts
of
millions
became
smaller
the
state
pension
funds
of
teachers
and
government
employees
lost
billions
upon
billions
of
dollars
americans
who
invested
their
nest
egg
to
watch
it
grow
saw
it
diminish
and
in
some
cases
disappear
and
while
that
decline
was
devastating
the
consequences
of
the
credit
crisis
that
caused
it
will
be
even
worse
if
we
do
not
act
now
we
in
very
dangerous
situation
where
financial
institutions
across
this
country
are
afraid
to
lend
money
and
if
all
that
meant
was
the
failure
of
few
banks
in
new
york
that
would
be
one
thing
but
that
not
what
it
means
what
it
means
is
if
we
do
act
it
will
be
harder
for
americans
to
get
mortgage
for
their
home
or
loans
they
need
to
buy
car
or
send
their
children
to
college
what
it
means
is
that
businesses
be
able
to
get
the
loans
they
need
to
open
new
factory
or
make
payroll
for
their
workers
and
if
they
make
payroll
on
friday
then
workers
are
laid
off
on
monday
and
if
workers
are
laid
off
on
monday
then
they
pay
their
bills
or
pay
back
their
loans
to
somebody
else
and
it
will
go
on
and
on
and
on
rippling
through
the
entire
economy
and
potentially
we
could
see
thousands
of
businesses
close
millions
of
jobs
could
be
lost
and
long
and
painful
recession
could
follow
in
other
words
this
is
not
just
wall
street
crisis
it
an
american
crisis
and
it
the
american
economy
that
needs
this
rescue
plan
understand
completely
why
people
would
be
when
this
president
asks
for
blank
check
to
solve
this
problem
was
too
as
was
senator
and
whole
bunch
of
us
here
and
that
why
over
week
ago
demanded
that
this
plan
include
some
specific
proposals
to
protect
taxpayers
protections
that
the
administration
eventually
agreed
to
and
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
senator
and
republican
counterparts
like
senator
we
here
in
the
senate
have
agreed
to
and
now
hopefully
the
house
will
agree
to
as
well
let
me
just
go
over
those
principles
number
one
said
we
needed
an
independent
board
to
provide
oversight
and
accountability
for
how
and
where
this
money
is
spent
at
every
step
of
the
way
number
two
said
that
we
can
not
help
banks
on
wall
street
without
helping
the
millions
of
innocent
homeowners
who
are
struggling
to
stay
in
their
homes
they
deserve
plan
too
number
three
said
that
would
not
allow
this
plan
to
become
welfare
program
for
wall
street
executives
whose
greed
and
irresponsibility
got
us
into
this
mess
and
finally
said
that
if
american
taxpayers
are
financing
this
solution
then
they
have
to
be
treated
like
investors
they
should
get
every
penny
of
their
tax
dollars
back
once
the
economy
recovers
now
this
last
part
is
important
because
it
been
the
most
misunderstood
and
poorly
communicated
part
of
this
plan
this
is
not
plan
to
just
hand
over
billion
dollars
of
taxpayer
money
to
few
banks
if
this
is
managed
correctly
and
that
an
important
if
we
will
hopefully
get
most
or
all
of
our
money
back
and
possibly
even
turn
profit
on
the
government
intervention
every
penny
of
which
will
go
directly
back
to
the
american
people
and
if
we
fall
short
we
will
levy
fee
on
financial
institutions
so
that
they
can
repay
for
the
losses
that
they
caused
now
let
me
let
acknowledge
even
with
all
these
taxpayer
protections
this
plan
is
not
perfect
democrats
and
republicans
in
congress
have
legitimate
concerns
about
it
some
of
my
closest
colleagues
people
have
the
greatest
respect
for
still
have
problems
with
it
and
may
choose
to
vote
against
this
bill
and
think
that
we
can
respectfully
disagree
understand
their
frustrations
also
know
that
many
many
americans
share
their
concerns
but
it
clear
that
from
my
perspective
this
is
what
we
need
to
do
right
now
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
crisis
turning
into
catastrophe
it
is
conceivable
it
possible
that
if
we
did
nothing
everything
would
turn
out
okay
it
there
there
possibility
that
that
true
and
there
no
doubt
that
there
may
be
other
plans
out
there
that
had
we
had
two
or
three
or
six
months
to
develop
might
be
even
more
refined
and
might
serve
our
purposes
better
but
we
do
have
that
kind
of
time
and
we
afford
to
take
risk
that
the
economy
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
as
consequence
the
worldwide
economy
could
be
plunged
into
very
very
deep
hole
so
to
democrats
and
republicans
who
opposed
this
plan
say
step
up
to
the
plate
let
do
what
right
for
the
country
at
this
time
because
the
time
to
act
is
now
know
many
americans
are
wondering
what
happens
next
and
passing
this
bill
be
the
end
of
our
work
to
strengthen
our
economy
it
must
be
the
beginning
because
one
thing
think
all
of
us
who
may
end
up
supporting
this
bill
understand
is
that
even
if
we
get
this
in
place
we
could
still
have
enormous
problems
and
probably
will
have
big
problems
in
the
economy
over
the
next
several
months
and
potentially
longer
because
the
fact
is
is
that
we
have
seen
some
mismanagement
of
the
fundamentals
of
the
economy
for
very
long
time
and
we
are
not
going
to
dig
ourselves
out
of
that
hole
immediately
so
this
is
not
the
end
this
is
the
beginning
as
soon
as
we
pass
this
rescue
plan
we
need
to
move
aggressively
with
the
same
sense
of
urgency
to
rescue
families
on
main
street
who
are
struggling
to
pay
their
bills
and
keep
their
jobs
they
been
in
crisis
lot
longer
than
wall
street
has
said
it
before
and
say
it
again
we
need
to
pass
an
economic
stimulus
package
that
will
help
ordinary
americans
cope
with
rising
food
and
gas
prices
that
can
save
one
million
jobs
rebuilding
our
schools
and
roads
and
our
infrastructure
and
help
states
and
cities
avoid
budget
cuts
and
tax
increase
plan
that
would
extend
expiring
unemployment
benefits
for
those
americans
who
lost
their
jobs
and
can
not
find
new
ones
that
the
right
thing
to
do
at
time
when
consumer
confidence
is
down
and
we
are
in
great
danger
of
slipping
into
big
recession
we
also
must
do
more
in
this
rescue
package
in
order
to
help
homeowners
stay
in
their
homes
will
continue
to
advocate
bankruptcy
reforms
know
my
colleague
from
illinois
has
been
strong
champion
of
this
as
have
many
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
to
change
our
bankruptcy
laws
so
that
people
have
better
chance
of
staying
in
their
homes
and
we
not
seeing
communities
devastated
all
across
the
country
and
we
should
encourage
treasury
to
study
the
option
of
buying
individual
mortgages
like
we
did
successfully
in
the
and
finally
while
we
all
hope
that
this
rescue
package
succeeds
we
should
be
prepared
to
take
more
vigorous
actions
in
the
months
ahead
to
rebuild
capital
if
it
necessary
now
just
as
families
are
planning
for
their
future
in
tough
times
washington
going
to
have
to
do
the
same
runaway
spending
and
record
deficits
are
not
how
families
run
their
budgets
it
be
how
washington
handles
people
tax
dollars
so
we
going
to
have
to
return
to
the
fiscal
responsibility
we
had
in
the
and
the
next
white
house
and
the
next
congress
is
going
to
have
to
work
together
to
make
sure
that
we
go
through
our
budget
we
get
rid
of
programs
that
do
work
that
we
make
the
ones
that
do
work
better
and
cost
less
with
less
money
flowing
into
the
treasury
some
useful
programs
or
policies
might
need
to
be
delayed
and
some
might
be
need
to
be
stretched
out
over
longer
period
of
time
but
there
are
certain
investments
in
our
future
that
we
can
not
delay
precisely
because
our
economy
is
in
turmoil
president
exceeded
the
time
little
bit
would
like
unanimous
consent
for
couple
more
minutes
cross
talk
from
the
floor
senate
president
is
there
objection
seeing
no
objection
senator
thank
you
there
are
certain
investments
in
our
future
that
we
delay
precisely
be
because
the
economy
in
turmoil
we
wait
to
help
americans
keep
up
with
rising
costs
and
shrinking
and
we
going
to
do
that
by
making
sure
that
we
are
giving
our
workers
tax
cut
we
wait
to
relieve
the
burden
of
crushing
health
care
costs
we
wait
to
create
millions
of
new
jobs
by
rebuilding
our
roads
and
our
bridges
and
investing
in
broadband
lines
in
rural
communities
and
fixing
our
electricity
grid
so
we
can
get
renewable
energy
to
population
that
need
them
and
we
need
to
develop
an
energy
policy
that
prevents
us
from
sending
billion
dollars
year
to
tyrants
and
dictators
for
their
oil
we
wait
to
educate
the
next
generation
of
americans
with
the
skills
and
knowledge
they
need
to
compete
with
any
workers
anywhere
in
the
world
these
are
the
priorities
we
can
not
delay
now
let
me
just
close
by
saying
this
do
not
think
this
is
going
to
be
easy
it
not
going
to
come
without
costs
we
are
all
going
to
need
to
sacrifice
we
all
going
to
need
to
pull
our
weight
because
now
more
than
ever
we
are
all
in
this
together
that
part
of
what
this
crisis
has
taught
us
that
in
the
end
of
the
day
there
no
real
separation
between
wall
street
and
main
street
there
only
the
road
we
on
as
americans
and
we
will
rise
or
fall
on
that
journey
as
one
nation
and
as
one
people
know
that
many
americans
are
feeling
anxiety
right
now
about
their
jobs
about
their
homes
about
their
life
savings
but
also
know
this
that
we
can
steer
ourselves
out
of
this
crisis
we
are
always
have
during
the
great
financial
crisis
of
the
last
century
in
his
first
fireside
chat
told
his
fellow
americans
that
there
is
an
element
in
the
of
our
financial
system
more
important
than
currency
more
important
than
gold
and
that
is
the
confidence
of
the
people
themselves
confidence
and
courage
are
the
essentials
of
success
in
carrying
out
our
plan
let
us
unite
in
banishing
fear
together
we
can
not
fail
we
can
not
fail
not
now
not
tomorrow
not
next
year
this
is
nation
that
faced
down
war
and
depression
great
challenges
and
great
threats
and
at
each
and
every
moment
we
have
risen
to
meet
up
these
challenges
not
as
democrats
not
as
republicans
but
as
americans
with
resolve
and
with
confidence
with
that
fundamental
belief
that
here
in
america
our
destiny
is
not
written
for
us
it
written
by
us
and
that
who
we
are
and
that
the
country
know
we
can
be
right
now
want
to
thank
again
the
extraordinary
leadership
of
chairman
and
banking
the
banking
committee
as
well
as
chairman
and
majority
leader

have
worked
tirelessly
want
to
thank
the
leadership
in
the
house
of
representatives
urge
my
colleagues
to
join
me
in
supporting
this
important
legislation
understanding
that
this
will
not
solve
all
our
problems
it
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
step
to
make
sure
that
this
economy
once
again
works
on
behalf
of
all
americans
in
their
pursuit
of
the
american
dream

historic
slate
of
candidates

inspiration

only

to
ted

the
spirit
of
service
and
to
the
next
vice
president
of
the
united
states
thank
you
am
grateful
to
finish
this
journey
with
one
of
the
finest
statesmen
of
our
time
man
at
ease
with
everyone
from
world
leaders
to
the
conductors
on
the
train
he
still
takes
home
every
night
to
the
love
of
my
life
the
next
first
lady
and
to
and
love
you
so
much
and
am
so
proud
of
you
four
years
ago
stood
before
you
and
told
you
my
story
of
the
brief
union
between
young
man
from
kenya
and
young
woman
from
who
were
or
but
shared
belief
that
in
america
their
son
could
achieve
whatever
he
put
his
mind
to
it
is
that
promise
that
always
set
this
country
apart
that
through
hard
work
and
sacrifice
each
of
us
can
pursue
our
individual
dreams
but
still
come
together
as
one
american
family
to
ensure
that
the
next
generation
can
pursue
their
dreams
as
well
it
why
stand
here
tonight
because
for
two
hundred
and
thirty
two
years
at
each
moment
when
that
promise
was
in
jeopardy
ordinary
men
and
women
students
and
soldiers
farmers
and
teachers
nurses
and
janitors
found
the
courage
to
keep
it
alive
we
meet
at
one
of
those
defining
moments
moment
when
our
nation
is
at
war
our
economy
is
in
turmoil
and
the
american
promise
has
been
threatened
once
more
tonight
more
americans
are
out
of
work
and
more
are
working
harder
for
less
more
of
you
have
lost
your
homes
and
even
more
are
watching
your
home
values
plummet
more
of
you
have
cars
you
afford
to
drive
credit
cards
bills
sic
you
afford
to
pay
and
tuition
that
beyond
your
reach
these
challenges
are
not
all
of
government
making
but
the
failure
to
respond
is
direct
result
of
broken
politics
in
washington
and
the
failed
policies
of
george
bush
america
we
are
better
than
these
last
eight
years
we
are
better
country
than
this
this
country
more
decent
than
one
woman
in
ohio
on
the
brink
of
retirement
finds
herself
one
disaster
after
lifetime
of
hard
work
we
better
country
than
one
where
man
in
indiana
has
to
pack
up
the
equipment
that
he
worked
on
for
twenty
years
and
watch
as
its
shipped
off
to
china
and
then
chokes
up
as
he
explains
how
he
felt
like
failure
when
he
went
home
to
tell
his
family
the
news
we
are
more
compassionate
than
government
that
lets
veterans
sleep
on
our
streets
and
families
slide
into
poverty
that
sits
that
sits
on
its
hands
while
major
american
city
drowns
before
our
eyes
tonight
tonight
say
to
the
people
of
america
to
democrats
and
republicans
and
independents
across
this
great
land
enough
this
moment
this
moment
this
election
is
our
chance
to
keep
in
the
century
the
american
promise
alive
because
next
week
in
the
same
party
that
brought
you
two
terms
of
george
bush
and
will
ask
this
country
for
third
and
we
are
here
we
are
here
because
we
love
this
country
too
much
to
let
the
next
four
years
look
just
like
the
last
eight
on
november
on
november
we
must
stand
up
and
say
eight
is
enough
now
now
let
me
let
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
republican
nominee
john
has
worn
the
uniform
of
our
country
with
bravery
and
distinction
and
for
that
we
owe
him
our
gratitude
and
our
respect
and
next
week
we
also
hear
about
those
occasions
when
he
broken
with
his
party
as
evidence
that
he
can
deliver
the
change
that
we
need
but
the
record
clear
john
has
voted
with
george
bush
ninety
percent
of
the
time
senator
likes
to
talk
about
judgment
but
really
what
does
it
say
about
your
judgment
when
you
think
george
bush
has
been
right
more
than
ninety
percent
of
the
time
do
know
about
you
but
not
ready
to
take
ten
percent
chance
on
change
the
truth
is
on
issue
after
issue
that
would
make
difference
in
your
lives
on
health
care
and
education
and
the
economy
senator
has
been
anything
but
independent
he
says
that
our
economy
has
made
great
progress
under
this
president
he
said
that
the
fundamentals
of
the
economy
are
strong
and
when
one
of
his
chief
the
man
who
wrote
his
economic
plan
was
talking
about
the
anxieties
that
americans
are
feeling
he
said
that
we
were
just
suffering
from
mental
recession
and
that
we
become
and
quote
nation
of
nation
of
tell
that
to
the
proud
at
michigan
plant
who
after
they
found
out
it
was
closing
kept
showing
up
everyday
and
working
as
hard
as
ever
because
they
knew
there
were
people
who
counted
on
the
brakes
that
they
made
tell
that
to
the
military
families
who
shoulder
their
burden
silently
as
they
watch
their
loved
ones
leave
for
there
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
tour
of
duty
these
are
not
they
work
hard
and
they
give
back
and
they
keep
going
without
complaint
these
are
the
americans
know
now
do
believe
that
senator
does
care
what
going
on
in
the
lives
of
americans
just
think
he
does
know
why
else
would
he
define
as
someone
making
under
five
million
dollars
year
how
else
could
he
propose
hundreds
of
billions
in
tax
breaks
for
big
corporations
and
oil
companies
but
not
one
penny
of
tax
relief
to
more
than
one
hundred
million
americans
how
else
could
he
offer
health
care
plan
that
would
actually
tax
people
benefits
or
an
education
plan
that
would
do
nothing
to
help
families
pay
for
college
or
plan
that
would
social
security
and
gamble
your
retirement
it
not
because
john
does
care
it
because
john
does
get
it
for
over
two
decades
for
over
two
decades
he
subscribed
to
that
old
discredited
republican
philosophy
give
more
and
more
to
those
with
the
most
and
hope
that
prosperity
trickles
down
to
everyone
else
in
washington
they
call
this
the
ownership
society
but
what
it
really
means
is
that
you
on
your
own
out
of
work
tough
luck
you
on
your
own
no
health
care
the
market
will
fix
it
you
on
your
own
born
into
poverty
pull
yourself
up
by
your
own
bootstraps
even
if
you
do
have
boots
you
are
on
your
own
well
it
time
for
them
to
own
their
failure
it
time
for
us
to
change
america
and
that
why
running
for
president
of
the
united
states
you
see
you
see
we
democrats
have
very
different
measure
of
what
constitutes
progress
in
this
country
we
measure
progress
by
how
many
people
can
find
job
that
pays
the
mortgage
whether
you
can
put
little
extra
money
away
at
the
end
of
each
month
so
you
can
someday
watch
your
child
receive
her
college
diploma
we
measure
progress
in
the
million
new
jobs
that
were
created
when
bill
was
president
when
the
average
american
family
saw
its
income
go
up
dollars
instead
of
go
down
dollars
like
it
has
under
george
bush
we
measure
the
strength
of
our
economy
not
by
the
number
of
billionaires
we
have
or
the
profits
of
the
fortune
but
by
whether
someone
with
good
idea
can
take
risk
and
start
new
business
or
whether
the
waitress
who
lives
on
tips
can
take
day
off
and
look
after
sick
kid
without
losing
her
job
an
economy
that
honors
the
dignity
of
work
the
fundamentals
we
use
to
measure
economic
strength
are
whether
we
are
living
up
to
that
fundamental
promise
that
has
made
this
country
great
promise
that
is
the
only
reason
am
standing
here
tonight
because
in
the
faces
of
those
young
veterans
who
come
back
from
iraq
and
see
my
grandfather
who
signed
up
after
pearl
marched
in
army
and
was
rewarded
by
grateful
nation
with
the
chance
to
go
to
college
on
the
bill
in
the
face
of
that
young
student
who
sleeps
just
three
hours
before
working
the
night
shift
think
about
my
mom
who
raised
my
sister
and
me
on
her
own
while
she
worked
and
earned
her
degree
who
once
turned
to
food
stamps
but
was
still
able
to
send
us
to
the
best
schools
in
the
country
with
the
help
of
student
loans
and
scholarships
when
when
listen
to
another
worker
tell
me
that
his
factory
has
shut
down
remember
all
those
men
and
women
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
who
stood
by
and
fought
for
two
decades
ago
after
the
local
steel
plant
closed
and
when
hear
woman
talk
about
the
difficulties
of
starting
her
own
business
or
making
her
way
in
the
world
think
about
my
grandmother
who
worked
her
way
up
from
the
secretarial
pool
to
middle
management
despite
years
of
being
passed
over
for
promotions
because
she
was
woman
she
the
one
who
taught
me
about
hard
work
she
the
one
who
put
off
buying
new
car
or
new
dress
for
herself
so
that
could
have
better
life
she
poured
everything
she
had
into
me
and
although
she
can
no
longer
travel
know
that
she
watching
tonight
and
that
tonight
is
her
night
as
well
now
now
do
know
what
kind
of
lives
john
thinks
that
celebrities
lead
but
this
has
been
mine
these
are
my
theirs
are
the
stories
that
shaped
my
life
and
it
is
on
behalf
of
them
that
intend
to
win
this
election
and
keep
our
promise
alive
as
president
of
the
united
states
what
what
is
that
american
promise
it
promise
that
says
each
of
us
has
the
freedom
to
make
of
our
own
lives
what
we
will
but
that
we
also
have
obligations
to
treat
each
other
with
dignity
and
respect
it
promise
that
says
the
market
should
reward
drive
and
innovation
and
generate
growth
but
that
businesses
should
live
up
to
their
responsibilities
to
create
american
jobs
to
look
out
for
american
workers
and
play
by
the
rules
of
the
road
ours
ours
is
promise
that
says
government
can
not
solve
all
our
problems
but
what
it
should
do
is
that
which
we
can
not
do
for
ourselves
protect
us
from
harm
and
provide
every
child
decent
education
keep
our
water
clean
and
our
toys
safe
invest
in
new
schools
and
new
roads
and
science
and
technology
our
government
should
work
for
us
not
against
us
it
should
help
us
not
hurt
us
it
should
ensure
opportunity
not
just
for
those
with
the
most
money
and
influence
but
for
every
american
who
willing
to
work
that
the
promise
of
america
the
idea
that
we
are
responsible
for
ourselves
but
that
we
also
rise
or
fall
as
one
nation
the
fundamental
belief
that
am
my
brother
keeper
am
my
sister
keeper
that
the
promise
we
need
to
keep
that
the
change
we
need
right
now
so
so
let
me
let
me
spell
out
exactly
what
that
change
would
mean
if
am
president
change
means
tax
code
that
does
reward
the
lobbyists
who
wrote
it
but
the
american
workers
and
small
businesses
who
deserve
it
you
know
unlike
john
will
stop
giving
tax
breaks
to
companies
that
ship
jobs
overseas
and
will
start
giving
them
to
companies
that
create
good
jobs
right
here
in
america
eliminate
capital
gains
taxes
for
the
small
businesses
and
that
will
create
the
jobs
of
tomorrow
will
listen
now
will
cut
taxes
cut
taxes
for
percent
of
all
working
families
because
in
an
economy
like
this
the
last
thing
we
should
do
is
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
and
for
the
sake
of
our
economy
our
security
and
the
future
of
our
planet
will
set
clear
goal
as
president
in
years
we
will
finally
end
our
dependence
on
oil
from
the
middle
east
we
will
do
this
washington
washington
has
been
talking
about
our
oil
addiction
for
the
last
years
and
by
the
way
john
has
been
there
for
of
them
and
in
that
time
he
has
said
no
to
higher
standards
for
cars
no
to
investment
in
renewable
energy
no
to
renewable
fuels
and
today
we
import
triple
the
amount
of
oil
than
we
had
on
the
day
that
senator
took
office
now
is
the
time
to
end
this
addiction
and
to
understand
that
drilling
is
measure
not
solution
not
even
close
as
president
as
president
will
tap
our
natural
gas
reserves
invest
in
clean
coal
technology
and
find
ways
to
safely
harness
nuclear
power
help
our
auto
companies
so
that
the
cars
of
the
future
are
built
right
here
in
america
make
it
easier
for
the
american
people
to
afford
these
new
cars
and
invest
billion
dollars
over
the
next
decade
in
affordable
renewable
sources
of
energy
wind
power
and
solar
power
and
the
next
generation
of
an
investment
that
will
lead
to
new
industries
and
five
million
new
jobs
that
pay
well
and
be
america
now
is
not
the
time
for
small
plans
now
is
the
time
to
finally
meet
our
moral
obligation
to
provide
every
child
education
because
it
will
take
nothing
less
to
compete
in
the
global
economy
you
know
and
are
only
here
tonight
because
we
were
given
chance
at
an
education
and
will
not
settle
for
an
america
where
some
kids
do
have
that
chance
invest
in
early
childhood
education
recruit
an
army
of
new
teachers
and
pay
them
higher
salaries
and
give
them
more
support
and
in
exchange
ask
for
higher
standards
and
more
accountability
and
we
will
keep
our
promise
to
every
young
american
if
you
commit
to
serving
your
community
or
our
country
we
will
make
sure
you
can
afford
college
education
now
now
is
the
time
to
finally
keep
the
promise
of
affordable
accessible
health
care
for
every
single
american
if
you
have
health
care
if
you
have
health
care
my
plan
will
lower
your
premiums
if
you
do
you
be
able
to
get
the
same
kind
of
coverage
that
members
of
congress
give
themselves
and
and
as
someone
who
watched
my
mother
argue
with
insurance
companies
while
she
lay
in
bed
dying
of
cancer
will
make
certain
those
companies
stop
discriminating
against
those
who
are
sick
and
need
care
the
most
now
is
the
time
to
help
families
with
paid
sick
days
and
better
family
leave
because
nobody
in
america
should
have
to
choose
between
keeping
their
job
and
caring
for
sick
child
or
an
ailing
parent
now
is
the
time
to
change
our
bankruptcy
laws
so
that
your
pensions
are
protected
ahead
of
bonuses
and
the
time
to
protect
social
security
for
future
generations
and
now
is
the
time
to
keep
the
promise
of
equal
pay
for
an
equal
day
work
because
want
my
daughters
to
have
the
exact
same
opportunities
as
your
sons
now
many
of
these
plans
will
cost
money
which
is
why
laid
out
how
pay
for
every
dime
by
closing
corporate
loopholes
and
tax
havens
that
do
help
america
grow
but
will
also
go
through
the
federal
budget
line
by
line
eliminating
programs
that
no
longer
work
and
making
the
ones
we
do
need
work
better
and
cost
less
because
we
can
not
meet
challenges
with
bureaucracy
and
democrats
democrats
we
must
also
admit
that
fulfilling
america
promise
will
require
more
than
just
money
it
will
require
renewed
sense
of
responsibility
from
each
of
us
to
recover
what
john
kennedy
called
our
intellectual
and
moral
strength
yes
government
must
lead
on
energy
independence
but
each
of
us
must
do
our
part
to
make
our
homes
and
businesses
more
efficient
yes
we
must
provide
more
ladders
to
success
for
young
men
who
fall
into
lives
of
crime
and
despair
but
we
must
also
admit
that
programs
alone
replace
parents
that
government
turn
off
the
television
and
make
child
do
her
homework
that
fathers
must
take
more
responsibility
to
provide
love
and
guidance
to
their
children
individual
responsibility
and
mutual
responsibility
that
the
essence
of
america
promise
and
just
as
we
keep
our
promise
to
the
next
generation
here
at
home
so
must
we
keep
america
promise
abroad
if
john
wants
to
have
debate
about
who
has
the
temperament
and
judgment
to
serve
as
the
next
that
debate
ready
to
have
for
for
while
while
senator
was
turning
his
sights
to
iraq
just
days
after
stood
up
and
opposed
this
war
knowing
that
it
would
distract
us
from
the
real
threats
that
we
face
when
john
said
we
could
just
muddle
through
in
argued
for
more
resources
and
more
troops
to
finish
the
fight
against
the
terrorists
who
actually
attacked
us
on
and
made
clear
that
we
must
take
out
bin
laden
and
his
lieutenants
if
we
have
them
in
our
sights
you
know
john
likes
to
say
that
he
follow
bin
laden
to
the
gates
of
hell
but
he
even
follow
him
to
the
cave
where
he
lives
and
today
today
as
my
call
for
timeframe
to
remove
our
troops
from
iraq
has
been
echoed
by
the
iraqi
government
and
even
the
bush
administration
even
after
we
learned
that
iraq
has
billion
dollars
in
surplus
while
we
are
wallowing
in
deficit
john
stands
alone
in
his
stubborn
refusal
to
end
misguided
war
that
not
the
judgment
we
need
that
keep
america
safe
we
need
president
who
can
face
the
threats
of
the
future
not
keep
grasping
at
the
ideas
of
the
past
you
do
defeat
you
do
defeat
terrorist
network
that
operates
in
countries
by
occupying
iraq
you
do
protect
israel
and
deter
iran
just
by
talking
tough
in
washington
you
truly
stand
up
for
georgia
when
you
strained
our
oldest
alliances
if
john
wants
to
follow
george
bush
with
more
tough
talk
and
bad
strategy
that
is
his
choice
but
that
is
not
the
change
that
america
needs
we
are
the
party
of
we
are
the
party
of
kennedy
so
do
tell
me
that
democrats
defend
this
country
do
tell
me
that
democrats
keep
us
safe
the
foreign
policy
has
squandered
the
legacy
that
generations
of
americans
democrats
and
republicans
have
built
and
we
are
here
to
restore
that
legacy
as
will
never
hesitate
to
defend
this
nation
but
will
only
send
our
troops
into
harm
way
with
clear
mission
and
sacred
commitment
to
give
them
the
equipment
they
need
in
battle
and
the
care
and
benefits
they
deserve
when
they
come
home
will
end
this
war
in
iraq
responsibly
and
finish
the
fight
against
and
the
in
will
rebuild
our
military
to
meet
future
conflicts
but
will
also
renew
the
tough
direct
diplomacy
that
can
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapons
and
curb
russian
aggression
will
build
new
partnerships
to
defeat
the
threats
of
the
century
terrorism
and
nuclear
proliferation
poverty
and
genocide
climate
change
and
disease
and
will
restore
our
moral
standing
so
that
america
is
once
again
that
last
best
hope
for
all
who
are
called
to
the
cause
of
freedom
who
long
for
lives
of
peace
and
who
yearn
for
better
future
these
these
are
the
policies
will
pursue
and
in
the
weeks
ahead
look
forward
to
debating
them
with
john
but
what
will
not
do
is
suggest
that
the
senator
takes
his
positions
for
political
purposes
because
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
to
change
in
our
politics
is
the
idea
that
people
can
not
disagree
without
challenging
each
other
character
and
each
other
patriotism
the
times
are
too
serious
the
stakes
are
too
high
for
this
same
partisan
so
let
us
agree
that
patriotism
has
no
party
love
this
country
and
so
do
you
and
so
does
john
the
men
and
women
who
serve
in
our
battlefields
may
be
democrats
and
republicans
and
independents
but
they
have
fought
together
and
bled
together
and
some
died
together
under
the
same
proud
flag
they
have
not
served
red
america
or
blue
america
they
have
served
the
united
states
of
america
so
got
news
for
you
john
we
all
put
our
country
first
america
our
work
will
not
be
easy
the
challenges
we
face
require
tough
choices
and
democrats
as
well
as
republicans
will
need
to
cast
off
the
ideas
and
politics
of
the
past
for
part
of
what
has
been
lost
these
past
eight
years
just
be
measured
by
lost
wages
or
bigger
trade
deficits
what
has
also
been
lost
is
our
sense
of
common
purpose
and
that
what
we
have
to
restore
we
may
not
agree
on
abortion
but
surely
we
can
agree
on
reducing
the
number
of
unwanted
pregnancies
in
this
country
the
the
reality
of
gun
ownership
may
be
different
for
hunters
in
rural
ohio
than
they
are
for
those
plagued
by
gang
violence
in
but
do
tell
me
we
uphold
the
second
amendment
while
keeping
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
know
there
are
differences
on
marriage
but
surely
we
can
agree
that
our
gay
and
lesbian
brothers
and
sisters
deserve
to
visit
the
person
they
love
in
hospital
and
to
live
lives
free
of
discrimination
you
know
passions
may
fly
on
immigration
but
do
know
anyone
who
benefits
when
mother
is
separated
from
her
infant
child
or
an
employer
undercuts
american
wages
by
hiring
illegal
workers
but
this
too
is
part
of
america
promise
the
promise
of
democracy
where
we
can
find
the
strength
and
grace
to
bridge
divides
and
unite
in
common
effort
know
there
are
those
who
dismiss
such
beliefs
as
happy
talk
they
claim
that
our
insistence
on
something
larger
something
firmer
and
more
honest
in
our
public
life
is
just
horse
for
higher
taxes
and
the
abandonment
of
traditional
values
and
that
to
be
expected
because
if
you
do
have
any
fresh
ideas
then
you
use
stale
tactics
to
scare
voters
if
you
do
have
record
to
run
on
then
you
paint
your
opponent
as
someone
people
should
run
from
you
make
big
election
about
small
things
and
you
know
what
it
worked
before
because
it
feeds
into
the
cynicism
we
all
have
about
government
when
washington
does
work
all
its
promises
seem
empty
if
your
hopes
have
been
dashed
again
and
again
then
it
best
to
stop
hoping
and
settle
for
what
you
already
know
get
it
that
am
not
the
likeliest
candidate
for
this
office
do
fit
the
typical
pedigree
and
have
spent
my
career
in
the
halls
of
washington
but
stand
before
you
tonight
because
all
across
america
something
is
stirring
what
the
do
understand
is
that
this
election
has
never
been
about
me
it
about
you
it
about
you
for
long
months
you
have
stood
up
one
by
one
and
said
enough
to
the
politics
of
the
past
you
understand
that
in
this
election
the
greatest
risk
we
can
take
is
to
try
the
same
old
politics
with
the
same
old
players
and
expect
different
result
you
have
shown
what
history
teaches
us
that
at
defining
moments
like
this
one
the
change
we
need
does
come
from
washington
change
comes
to
washington
change
happens
change
happens
because
the
american
people
demand
it
because
they
rise
up
and
insist
on
new
ideas
and
new
leadership
new
politics
for
new
time
america
this
is
one
of
those
moments
believe
that
as
hard
as
it
will
be
the
change
we
need
is
coming
because
seen
it
because
lived
it
because
seen
it
in
illinois
when
we
provided
health
care
to
more
children
and
moved
more
families
from
welfare
to
work
seen
it
in
washington
where
we
worked
across
party
lines
to
open
up
government
and
hold
lobbyists
more
accountable
to
give
better
care
for
our
veterans
and
keep
nuclear
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
terrorists
and
seen
it
in
this
campaign
in
the
young
people
who
voted
for
the
first
time
and
the
young
at
heart
those
who
got
involved
again
after
very
long
time
in
the
republicans
who
never
thought
they
pick
up
democratic
ballot
but
did
seen
it
seen
it
in
the
workers
who
would
rather
cut
their
hours
back
day
even
though
they
afford
it
than
see
their
friends
lose
their
jobs
in
the
soldiers
who
after
losing
limb
in
the
good
who
take
stranger
in
when
hurricane
strikes
and
the
rise
you
know
this
country
of
ours
has
more
wealth
than
any
nation
but
that
not
what
makes
us
rich
we
have
the
most
powerful
military
on
earth
but
that
not
what
makes
us
strong
our
universities
and
our
culture
are
the
envy
of
the
world
but
that
not
what
keeps
the
world
coming
to
our
shores
instead
it
is
that
american
spirit
that
american
promise
that
pushes
us
forward
even
when
the
path
is
uncertain
that
binds
us
together
in
spite
of
our
differences
that
makes
us
fix
our
eye
not
on
what
is
seen
but
what
is
unseen
that
better
place
around
the
bend
that
promise
is
our
greatest
inheritance
it
promise
make
to
my
daughters
when
tuck
them
in
at
night
and
promise
that
you
make
to
yours
promise
that
has
led
immigrants
to
cross
oceans
and
pioneers
to
travel
west
promise
that
led
workers
to
picket
lines
and
women
to
reach
for
the
ballot
and
it
is
that
promise
that
years
ago
today
brought
americans
from
every
corner
of
this
land
to
stand
together
on
mall
in
washington
before
lincoln
memorial
and
hear
young
preacher
from
georgia
speak
of
his
dream
the
men
and
women
who
gathered
there
could
heard
many
things
they
could
heard
words
of
anger
and
discord
they
could
been
told
to
succumb
to
the
fear
and
frustrations
of
so
many
dreams
deferred
but
what
the
people
heard
instead
people
of
every
creed
and
from
every
walk
of
life
is
that
in
america
our
destiny
is
inextricably
linked
that
together
our
dreams
can
be
one
we
can
not
walk
alone
the
preacher
cried
and
as
we
walk
we
must
make
the
pledge
that
we
shall
always
march
ahead
we
can
not
turn
back
america
we
can
not
turn
back
not
with
so
much
work
to
be
done
not
with
so
many
children
to
educate
and
so
many
veterans
to
care
for
not
with
an
economy
to
fix
and
cities
to
rebuild
and
farms
to
save
not
with
so
many
families
to
protect
and
so
many
lives
to
mend
america
we
can
not
turn
back
we
can
not
walk
alone
at
this
moment
in
this
election
we
must
pledge
once
more
to
march
into
the
future
let
us
keep
that
promise
that
american
promise
and
in
the
words
of
scripture
hold
firmly
without
wavering
to
the
hope
that
we
confess
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
to
the
citizens
of
berlin
and
thank
you
to
the
people
of
germany
let
me
thank
chancellor
and
foreign
minister
for
welcoming
me
earlier
today
thank
you
mayor
the
berlin
senate
the
police
and
most
of
all
thanks
to
all
of
you
for
this
extraordinary
welcome
thank
you
come
to
berlin
as
so
many
of
my
countrymen
have
come
before
although
tonight
speak
to
you
not
as
candidate
for
president
but
as
citizen
proud
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
fellow
citizen
of
the
world
know
that
look
like
the
americans
previously
spoken
in
this
great
city
the
journey
that
led
me
here
is
improbable
my
mother
was
born
in
the
heartland
of
america
but
my
father
grew
up
herding
goats
in
kenya
his
father
his
father
my
grandfather
was
cook
domestic
servant
to
the
british
at
the
height
of
the
cold
war
my
father
decided
like
so
many
others
in
the
forgotten
corners
of
the
world
that
his
yearning
his
dream
required
the
freedom
and
opportunity
promised
by
the
west
and
so
he
wrote
letter
after
letter
to
universities
all
across
america
until
somebody
somewhere
answered
his
prayer
for
better
life
that
is
why
am
here
and
you
are
here
because
you
too
know
that
yearning
this
city
of
all
cities
knows
the
dream
of
freedom
and
you
know
that
the
only
reason
we
stand
here
tonight
is
because
men
and
women
from
both
of
our
nations
came
together
to
work
and
struggle
and
sacrifice
for
that
better
life
ours
is
partnership
that
truly
began
years
ago
this
summer
on
the
day
when
the
first
american
plane
touched
down
at
on
that
day
on
that
day
much
of
this
continent
still
lay
in
ruin
the
rubble
of
this
city
had
yet
to
be
built
into
wall
the
soviet
shadow
had
swept
across
eastern
europe
while
in
the
west
america
britain
and
france
took
their
stock
of
their
losses
and
pondered
how
the
world
might
be
remade
this
is
where
the
two
sides
met
and
on
the
of
june
the
communists
chose
to
blockade
the
western
part
of
the
city
they
cut
off
food
and
supplies
to
more
than
two
million
germans
in
an
effort
to
extinguish
the
last
flame
of
freedom
in
berlin
the
size
of
our
forces
was
no
match
for
the
larger
soviet
army
and
yet
retreat
would
have
allowed
communism
to
march
across
europe
where
the
last
war
had
ended
another
world
war
could
have
easily
begun
and
all
that
stood
in
the
way
was
berlin
and
when
that
when
the
airlift
began
when
the
largest
and
most
unlikely
rescue
in
the
history
brought
food
and
hope
to
the
people
of
this
city
the
odds
were
stacked
against
success
in
the
winter
heavy
fog
filled
the
sky
above
and
many
planes
were
forced
to
turn
back
without
dropping
off
the
needed
supplies
the
streets
where
we
stand
were
filled
with
hungry
families
who
had
no
comfort
from
the
cold
but
in
the
darkest
hours
the
people
of
berlin
kept
the
flame
of
hope
burning
the
people
of
berlin
refused
to
give
up
and
on
one
fall
day
hundreds
of
thousands
of
came
here
to
the
and
heard
the
mayor
implore
the
world
not
to
give
up
on
freedom
is
only
one
possibility
he
said
us
to
stand
together
united
until
this
battle
is
people
of
berlin
have
spoken
we
have
done
our
duty
he
said
and
we
will
keep
on
doing
our
duty
people
of
the
world
now
do
your
duty
people
of
the
world
look
at
people
of
the
world
look
at
berlin
look
at
berlin
where
germans
and
americans
learned
to
work
together
and
trust
each
other
less
than
three
years
after
facing
each
other
on
the
field
of
battle
look
at
berlin
where
the
determination
of
people
met
the
generosity
of
the
plan
and
created
german
miracle
where
where
victory
over
tyranny
gave
rise
to
nato
the
greatest
alliance
ever
formed
to
defend
our
common
security
look
at
berlin
where
the
bullet
holes
in
the
buildings
and
the
stones
and
pillars
near
the
gate
insist
that
we
never
forget
our
common
humanity
people
of
the
world
look
at
berlin
where
wall
came
down
continent
came
together
and
history
proved
that
there
is
no
challenge
too
great
for
world
that
stands
as
one
sixty
years
after
the
airlift
we
are
called
upon
again
history
has
led
us
to
new
with
new
promise
and
new
peril
when
you
the
german
people
tore
down
that
wall
wall
that
divided
east
and
west
freedom
and
tyranny
fear
and
hope
walls
came
tumbling
down
around
the
world
from
kiev
to
cape
town
prison
camps
were
closed
and
the
doors
of
democracy
were
opened
markets
opened
too
and
the
spread
of
information
and
technology
reduced
barriers
to
opportunity
and
prosperity
while
the
century
taught
us
that
we
share
common
destiny
the
century
has
revealed
world
more
intertwined
than
at
any
time
in
human
history
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
brought
new
hope
but
that
very
closeness
has
given
rise
to
new
dangers
dangers
that
can
not
be
contained
within
the
borders
of
country
or
by
the
distance
of
an
ocean
think
about
it
the
terrorists
of
september
plotted
in
hamburg
and
trained
in
and
before
killing
thousands
from
all
over
the
globe
on
american
soil
as
we
speak
cars
in
boston
and
factories
in
beijing
are
melting
the
ice
caps
in
the
arctic
shrinking
coastlines
in
the
atlantic
and
bringing
drought
to
farms
from
to
kenya
poorly
secured
nuclear
material
in
the
former
soviet
union
or
secrets
from
scientist
in
pakistan
could
help
build
bomb
that
detonates
in
paris
the
poppies
in
come
to
berlin
in
the
form
of
the
heroin
the
poverty
and
violence
in
somalia
breeds
the
terror
of
tomorrow
the
genocide
in
shames
the
conscience
of
us
all
in
this
new
world
such
dangerous
currents
have
swept
along
faster
than
our
efforts
to
contain
them
and
that
is
why
we
can
not
afford
to
be
divided
no
one
nation
no
matter
how
large
or
powerful
can
defeat
such
challenges
alone
none
of
us
can
deny
these
threats
or
escape
in
meeting
them
in
the
absence
of
soviet
tanks
and
terrible
wall
it
has
become
easy
to
forget
this
truth
and
if
honest
with
each
other
we
know
that
sometimes
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
we
have
drifted
apart
and
forgotten
our
shared
destiny
in
europe
the
view
that
america
is
part
of
what
has
gone
wrong
in
our
world
rather
than
force
to
help
us
make
it
right
has
become
all
too
common
in
america
there
are
voices
that
deride
and
deny
the
importance
of
role
in
our
security
and
our
future
both
views
miss
the
truth
that
today
are
bearing
new
burdens
and
taking
more
responsibility
in
critical
parts
of
the
world
and
that
just
as
american
bases
built
in
the
last
century
still
help
to
defend
the
security
of
this
continent
so
does
our
country
still
sacrifice
greatly
for
freedom
around
the
globe
yes
there
have
been
differences
between
america
and
europe
no
doubt
there
will
be
differences
in
the
future
but
the
burdens
of
global
citizenship
continue
to
bind
us
together
change
of
leadership
in
washington
will
not
lift
this
burden
in
this
new
century
americans
and
alike
will
be
required
to
do
more
not
less
partnership
and
cooperation
among
nations
is
not
choice
it
is
the
only
way
the
one
way
to
protect
our
common
security
and
advance
our
common
humanity
that
is
why
the
greatest
danger
of
all
is
to
allow
new
walls
to
divide
us
from
one
another
the
walls
between
old
allies
on
either
side
of
the
atlantic
can
not
stand
the
walls
between
the
countries
with
the
most
and
those
with
the
least
can
not
stand
the
walls
between
races
and
tribes
natives
and
immigrants
and
muslims
and
jews
can
not
stand
these
now
are
the
walls
we
must
tear
down
we
know
we
know
that
these
walls
have
fallen
before
after
centuries
of
strife
the
people
of
europe
have
formed
union
of
promise
and
prosperity
here
at
the
base
of
column
built
to
mark
victory
in
war
we
meet
in
the
of
europe
at
peace
not
only
have
walls
come
down
in
berlin
but
they
come
down
in
belfast
where
protestant
and
catholic
found
way
to
live
together
in
the
where
our
atlantic
alliance
ended
wars
and
brought
savage
war
criminals
to
justice
and
in
south
africa
where
the
struggle
of
courageous
people
defeated
so
history
reminds
us
that
walls
can
be
torn
down
but
the
task
is
never
easy
true
partnership
and
true
progress
requires
constant
work
and
sustained
sacrifice
they
require
sharing
the
burdens
of
development
and
diplomacy
of
peace
and
progress
they
require
allies
who
will
listen
to
each
other
learn
from
each
other
and
most
of
all
trust
each
other
that
is
why
america
can
not
turn
inward
that
is
why
europe
can
not
turn
inward
america
has
no
better
partner
than
europe
now
now
is
the
time
to
build
new
bridges
across
the
globe
as
strong
as
the
one
that
binds
us
across
the
atlantic
now
is
the
time
to
join
together
through
constant
cooperation
and
strong
institutions
and
shared
sacrifice
and
global
commitment
to
progress
to
meet
the
challenges
of
the
century
it
was
this
spirit
that
led
airlift
planes
to
appear
in
the
sky
above
our
heads
and
people
to
assemble
where
we
stand
today
and
this
is
the
moment
when
our
nations
and
all
nations
must
summon
that
spirit
anew
this
is
the
moment
when
we
must
defeat
terror
and
dry
up
the
well
of
extremism
that
supports
it
this
threat
is
real
and
we
can
not
shrink
from
our
responsibility
to
combat
it
if
we
could
create
nato
to
face
down
the
soviet
union
we
can
join
in
new
and
global
partnership
to
dismantle
the
networks
that
have
struck
in
madrid
and
amman
in
london
and
bali
in
washington
and
new
york
if
we
could
win
battle
of
ideas
against
the
communists
we
can
stand
with
the
vast
majority
of
muslims
who
reject
the
extremism
that
leads
to
hate
instead
of
hope
this
is
the
moment
when
we
must
renew
our
resolve
to
rout
the
terrorists
who
threaten
our
security
in
and
the
traffickers
who
sell
drugs
on
your
streets
no
one
welcomes
war
the
enormous
difficulties
in
but
my
country
and
yours
have
stake
in
seeing
that
first
mission
beyond
borders
is
success
for
the
people
of
and
for
our
shared
security
the
work
must
be
done
america
do
this
alone
the
afghan
people
need
our
troops
and
your
troops
our
support
and
your
support
to
defeat
the
and
to
develop
their
economy
and
to
help
them
rebuild
their
nation
we
have
too
much
at
stake
to
turn
back
now
this
this
is
the
moment
when
we
must
renew
the
goal
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
the
two
superpowers
that
faced
each
other
across
the
wall
of
this
city
came
too
close
too
often
to
destroying
all
we
have
built
and
all
that
we
love
with
that
wall
gone
we
need
not
stand
idly
by
and
watch
the
further
spread
of
the
deadly
atom
it
is
time
to
secure
all
loose
nuclear
materials
to
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
to
reduce
the
arsenals
from
another
era
this
is
the
moment
to
begin
the
work
of
seeking
the
peace
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
this
is
the
moment
when
every
nation
in
europe
must
have
the
chance
to
choose
its
own
tomorrow
free
from
the
shadows
of
yesterday
in
this
century
we
need
strong
european
union
that
deepens
the
security
and
prosperity
of
this
continent
while
extending
hand
abroad
in
this
century
in
this
city
of
all
cities
we
must
reject
the
cold
war
of
the
past
and
resolve
to
work
with
russia
when
we
can
to
stand
up
for
our
values
when
we
must
and
to
seek
partnership
that
extends
across
this
entire
continent
this
is
the
moment
when
we
must
build
on
the
wealth
that
opens
sic
markets
have
created
and
share
its
benefits
more
equitably
trade
has
been
cornerstone
of
our
growth
and
global
development
but
we
will
not
be
able
to
sustain
this
growth
if
it
the
few
and
not
the
many
together
together
we
must
forge
trade
that
truly
rewards
the
work
that
creates
wealth
with
meaningful
protections
for
our
people
and
our
planet
this
is
the
moment
for
trade
that
is
free
and
fair
for
all
this
is
the
moment
we
must
help
answer
the
call
for
new
dawn
in
the
middle
east
my
country
must
stand
with
yours
and
with
europe
in
sending
direct
message
to
iran
that
it
must
abandon
its
nuclear
ambitions
we
must
support
the
who
marched
and
bled
for
democracy
and
the
israelis
and
the
who
seek
secure
and
lasting
peace
and
despite
despite
past
differences
this
is
the
moment
when
the
world
should
support
the
millions
of
iraqis
who
seek
to
rebuild
their
lives
even
as
we
pass
responsibility
to
the
iraqi
government
and
finally
bring
this
war
to
close
this
this
is
the
moment
when
we
must
come
together
to
save
this
planet
let
us
resolve
that
we
will
not
leave
our
children
to
world
where
the
oceans
rise
and
famine
spreads
and
terrible
storms
devastate
our
lands
let
us
resolve
that
all
nations
including
my
own
will
act
with
the
same
seriousness
of
purpose
as
has
your
nation
and
reduce
the
carbon
we
send
into
our
atmosphere
this
this
is
the
moment
to
give
our
children
back
their
future
this
is
the
moment
to
stand
as
one
and
this
is
the
moment
when
we
must
give
hope
to
those
left
behind
in
world
we
must
remember
that
the
cold
war
born
in
this
city
was
not
battle
for
land
or
treasure
sixty
years
ago
the
planes
that
flew
over
berlin
did
not
drop
bombs
instead
they
delivered
food
and
coal
and
candy
to
grateful
children
and
in
that
show
of
solidarity
those
pilots
won
more
than
military
victory
they
won
hearts
and
minds
love
and
loyalty
and
trust
not
just
from
the
people
in
this
city
but
from
all
those
who
heard
the
story
of
what
they
did
here
now
the
world
will
watch
and
remember
what
we
do
here
what
we
do
with
this
moment
will
we
extend
our
hand
to
the
people
in
the
forgotten
corners
of
this
world
who
yearn
for
lives
marked
by
dignity
and
opportunity
by
security
and
justice
will
we
lift
the
child
in
from
poverty
and
shelter
the
refugee
in
chad
and
banish
the
scourge
of
aids
in
our
time
will
we
stand
for
the
human
rights
of
the
dissident
in
burma
the
in
iran
or
the
voter
in
zimbabwe
will
we
give
meaning
to
the
words
in
will
we
acknowledge
will
we
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
more
powerful
example
than
the
one
each
of
our
nations
projects
to
the
world
will
we
reject
torture
and
stand
for
the
rule
of
law
will
we
will
we
will
we
welcome
immigrants
from
different
lands
and
shun
discrimination
against
those
who
look
like
us
or
worship
like
we
do
and
keep
the
promise
of
equality
and
opportunity
for
all
of
our
people
people
of
berlin
people
of
the
world
this
is
our
moment
this
is
our
time
know
my
country
has
not
perfected
itself
at
times
struggled
to
keep
the
promise
of
liberty
and
equality
for
all
of
our
people
made
our
share
of
mistakes
and
there
are
times
when
our
actions
around
the
world
have
not
lived
up
to
our
best
intentions
but
also
know
how
much
love
america
know
that
for
more
than
two
centuries
we
have
strived
at
great
cost
and
great
sacrifice
to
form
more
perfect
union
to
seek
with
other
nations
more
hopeful
world
our
allegiance
has
never
been
to
any
particular
tribe
or
kingdom
indeed
every
language
is
spoken
in
our
country
every
culture
has
left
its
imprint
on
ours
every
point
of
view
is
expressed
in
our
public
squares
what
has
always
united
us
what
has
always
driven
our
people
what
drew
my
father
to
shores
is
set
of
ideals
that
speak
to
aspirations
shared
by
all
people
that
we
can
live
free
from
fear
and
free
from
want
that
we
can
speak
our
minds
and
assemble
with
whomever
we
choose
and
worship
as
we
please
these
are
the
aspiration
that
join
the
fates
of
all
nations
in
this
city
these
aspirations
are
bigger
than
anything
that
drives
us
apart
it
is
because
of
these
aspirations
that
the
airlift
began
it
is
because
of
these
aspirations
that
all
free
people
everywhere
became
citizens
of
berlin
it
is
in
pursuit
of
these
aspirations
that
new
generation
our
generation
must
make
our
mark
on
the
world
people
of
berlin
and
people
of
the
world
the
scale
of
our
challenge
is
great
the
road
ahead
will
be
long
but
come
before
you
to
say
that
we
are
heirs
to
struggle
for
freedom
we
are
people
of
improbable
hope
with
an
eye
toward
the
future
with
resolve
in
our
heart
let
us
remember
this
history
and
answer
our
destiny
and
remake
the
world
once
again
thank
you
berlin
god
bless
you
thank
you
thank
you
years
ago
george
announced
the
plan
that
would
come
to
bear
his
name
much
of
europe
lay
in
ruins
the
united
states
faced
powerful
and
ideological
enemy
intent
on
world
domination
this
menace
was
magnified
by
the
recently
discovered
capability
to
destroy
life
on
an
unimaginable
scale
the
soviet
union
did
yet
have
an
atomic
bomb
but
before
long
it
would
the
challenge
facing
the
greatest
generation
of
americans
the
generation
that
had
vanquished
fascism
on
the
battlefield
was
how
to
contain
this
threat
while
extending
freedom
frontiers
leaders
like
and
and
knew
that
there
was
no
single
decisive
blow
that
could
be
struck
for
freedom
we
needed
new
strategy
to
meet
the
challenges
of
new
and
dangerous
world
such
strategy
would
join
overwhelming
military
strength
with
sound
judgment
it
would
shape
events
not
just
through
military
force
but
through
the
force
of
our
ideas
through
economic
power
intelligence
and
diplomacy
it
would
support
strong
allies
that
freely
shared
our
ideals
of
liberty
and
democracy
open
markets
and
the
rule
of
law
it
would
foster
new
international
institutions
like
the
united
nations
nato
and
the
world
bank
and
focus
on
every
corner
of
the
globe
it
was
strategy
that
saw
clearly
the
world
dangers
while
seizing
its
promise
as
general
had
spent
years
helping
wage
war
but
the
plan
which
was
just
one
part
of
this
strategy
helped
rebuild
not
just
allies
but
also
the
nation
that
had
plotted
to
defeat
in
the
announcing
his
plan
he
concluded
not
with
tough
talk
or
definitive
declarations
but
rather
with
questions
and
call
for
perspective
the
whole
world
of
the
future
said
hangs
on
proper
judgment
to
make
that
judgment
he
asked
the
american
people
to
examine
distant
events
that
directly
affected
their
security
and
prosperity
he
closed
by
asking
what
is
needed
what
can
best
be
done
what
must
be
done
what
is
needed
what
can
best
be
done
what
must
be
done
today
dangers
are
different
though
no
less
grave
the
power
to
destroy
life
on
catastrophic
scale
now
risks
falling
into
the
hands
of
terrorists
the
future
of
our
security
and
our
planet
is
held
hostage
to
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
gas
from
the
spotted
mountains
of
pakistan
to
the
centrifuges
spinning
beneath
iranian
soil
we
know
that
the
american
people
can
not
be
protected
by
oceans
or
the
sheer
might
of
our
military
alone
the
attacks
of
september
brought
this
new
reality
into
terrible
and
ominous
focus
on
that
bright
and
beautiful
day
the
world
of
peace
and
prosperity
that
was
the
legacy
of
our
cold
war
victory
seemed
to
suddenly
vanish
under
rubble
and
twisted
steel
and
clouds
of
smoke
but
the
depth
of
this
tragedy
also
drew
out
the
decency
and
determination
of
our
nation
at
blood
banks
and
vigils
in
schools
and
in
the
united
states
congress
americans
were
united
more
united
even
than
we
were
at
the
dawn
of
the
cold
war
the
world
too
was
united
against
the
perpetrators
of
this
evil
act
as
old
allies
new
friends
and
even
adversaries
stood
by
our
side
it
was
time
once
again
for
america
might
and
moral
suasion
to
be
harnessed
it
was
time
to
once
again
shape
new
security
strategy
for
an
world
imagine
for
moment
what
we
could
have
done
in
those
days
and
months
and
years
after
we
could
have
deployed
the
full
force
of
american
power
to
hunt
down
and
destroy
bin
laden
the
and
all
of
the
terrorists
responsible
for
while
supporting
real
security
in
we
could
have
secured
loose
nuclear
materials
around
the
world
and
updated
century
framework
to
meet
the
challenges
of
the
we
could
have
invested
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
alternative
sources
of
energy
to
grow
our
economy
save
our
planet
and
end
the
tyranny
of
oil
we
could
have
strengthened
old
alliances
formed
new
partnerships
and
renewed
international
institutions
to
advance
peace
and
prosperity
we
could
have
called
on
new
generation
to
step
into
the
strong
currents
of
history
and
to
serve
their
country
as
troops
and
teachers
peace
corps
volunteers
and
police
officers
we
could
have
secured
our
homeland
investing
in
sophisticated
new
protection
for
our
ports
our
trains
and
our
power
plants
we
could
have
rebuilt
our
roads
and
bridges
laid
down
new
rail
and
broadband
and
electricity
systems
and
made
college
affordable
for
every
american
to
strengthen
our
ability
to
compete
we
could
have
done
that
instead
we
have
lost
thousands
of
american
lives
spent
nearly
trillion
dollars
alienated
allies
and
neglected
emerging
threats
all
in
the
cause
of
fighting
war
for
well
over
five
years
in
country
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
attacks
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
accomplished
every
mission
we
have
given
them
what
missing
in
our
debate
about
iraq
what
has
been
missing
since
before
the
war
began
is
discussion
of
the
strategic
consequences
of
iraq
and
its
dominance
of
our
foreign
policy
this
war
distracts
us
from
every
threat
that
we
face
and
so
many
opportunities
we
could
seize
this
war
diminishes
our
security
our
standing
in
the
world
our
military
our
economy
and
the
resources
that
we
need
to
confront
the
challenges
of
the
century
by
any
measure
our
and
focus
on
iraq
is
not
sound
strategy
for
keeping
america
safe
am
running
for
president
of
the
united
states
to
lead
this
country
in
new
direction
to
seize
this
moment
promise
instead
of
being
distracted
from
the
most
pressing
threats
that
we
face
want
to
overcome
them
instead
of
pushing
the
entire
burden
of
our
foreign
policy
on
to
the
brave
men
and
women
of
our
military
want
to
use
all
elements
of
american
power
to
keep
us
safe
and
prosperous
and
free
instead
of
alienating
ourselves
from
the
world
want
america
once
again
to
lead
as
president
will
pursue
tough
smart
and
principled
national
security
strategy
one
that
that
we
have
interests
not
just
in
baghdad
but
in
and
in
tokyo
and
london
in
beijing
and
berlin
will
focus
this
strategy
on
five
goals
essential
to
making
america
safer
ending
the
war
in
iraq
responsibly
finishing
the
fight
against
and
the
securing
all
nuclear
weapons
and
materials
from
terrorists
and
rogue
states
achieving
true
energy
security
and
rebuilding
our
alliances
to
meet
the
challenges
of
the
century
my
opponent
in
this
campaign
has
served
this
country
with
and
we
all
respect
his
sacrifice
we
both
want
to
do
what
we
think
is
best
to
defend
the
american
people
but
we
made
different
judgments
and
would
lead
in
very
different
directions
that
starts
with
iraq
opposed
going
to
war
in
iraq
senator
was
one
of
washington
biggest
supporters
for
war
warned
that
the
invasion
of
country
posing
no
imminent
threat
would
fan
the
flames
of
extremism
and
distract
us
from
the
fight
against
and
the
senator
claimed
that
we
would
be
greeted
as
liberators
and
that
democracy
would
spread
across
the
middle
east
those
were
the
judgments
we
made
on
the
most
important
strategic
question
since
the
end
of
the
cold
war
now
all
of
us
that
we
must
do
more
than
look
back
we
must
make
judgment
about
how
to
move
forward
what
is
needed
what
can
best
be
done
what
must
be
done
senator
wants
to
talk
of
our
tactics
in
iraq
want
to
focus
on
new
strategy
for
iraq
and
the
wider
world
it
has
been
months
since
president
bush
announced
the
surge
as
have
said
many
times
our
troops
have
performed
brilliantly
in
lowering
the
level
of
violence
general
has
used
new
tactics
to
protect
the
iraqi
population
we
have
talked
directly
to
tribes
that
used
to
be
hostile
to
america
and
supported
their
fight
against
militias
have
generally
respected
fire
those
are
the
facts
and
all
americans
welcome
them
for
weeks
now
senator
has
argued
that
the
gains
of
the
surge
mean
that
should
change
my
commitment
to
end
the
war
but
this
argument
what
is
necessary
to
succeed
in
iraq
and
stubbornly
ignores
the
facts
of
the
broader
strategic
picture
that
we
face
in
the
months
since
the
surge
began
the
strain
on
our
military
has
increased
our
troops
and
their
families
have
borne
an
enormous
burden
and
american
taxpayers
have
spent
another
billion
in
iraq
that
over
billion
each
month
that
is
consequence
of
our
current
strategy
in
the
months
since
the
surge
began
the
situation
in
has
deteriorated
june
was
our
highest
casualty
month
of
the
war
the
has
been
on
the
offensive
even
launching
brazen
attack
on
one
of
our
bases
has
growing
sanctuary
in
pakistan
that
is
consequence
of
our
current
strategy
in
the
months
since
the
surge
began
as
warned
at
the
outset
iraq
leaders
have
not
made
the
political
progress
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
surge
they
have
not
invested
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
oil
revenues
to
rebuild
their
country
they
have
not
resolved
their
differences
or
shaped
new
political
compact
that
why
strongly
stand
by
my
plan
to
end
this
war
now
prime
minister
call
for
timetable
for
the
removal
of
forces
presents
real
opportunity
it
comes
at
time
when
the
american
general
in
charge
of
training
iraq
security
forces
has
testified
that
iraq
army
and
police
will
be
ready
to
assume
responsibility
for
iraq
security
in
now
is
the
time
for
responsible
redeployment
of
our
combat
troops
that
pushes
iraq
leaders
toward
political
solution
rebuilds
our
military
and
refocuses
on
and
our
broader
security
interests
george
bush
and
john
do
have
strategy
for
success
in
iraq
they
have
strategy
for
staying
in
iraq
they
said
we
could
leave
when
violence
was
up
they
say
we
leave
when
violence
is
down
they
refuse
to
press
the
iraqis
to
make
tough
choices
and
they
label
any
timetable
to
redeploy
our
troops
surrender
even
though
we
would
be
turning
iraq
over
to
sovereign
iraqi
government
not
to
terrorist
enemy
theirs
is
an
endless
focus
on
tactics
inside
iraq
with
no
consideration
of
our
strategy
to
face
threats
beyond
iraq
borders
at
some
point
judgment
must
be
made
iraq
is
not
going
to
be
perfect
place
and
we
do
have
unlimited
resources
to
try
to
make
it
one
we
are
not
going
to
kill
every
eliminate
every
trace
of
iranian
influence
or
stand
up
flawless
democracy
before
we
leave
general
and
ambassador
acknowledged
this
to
me
when
they
testified
last
april
that
is
why
the
accusation
of
surrender
is
false
rhetoric
used
to
justify
failed
policy
in
fact
true
success
in
iraq
victory
in
iraq
will
not
take
place
in
surrender
ceremony
where
an
enemy
lays
down
their
arms
true
success
will
take
place
when
we
leave
iraq
to
government
that
is
taking
responsibility
for
its
future
government
that
prevents
sectarian
conflict
and
ensures
that
the
threat
which
has
been
beaten
back
by
our
troops
does
not
that
is
an
achievable
goal
if
we
pursue
comprehensive
plan
to
press
the
iraqis
stand
up
to
achieve
that
success
will
give
our
military
new
mission
on
my
first
day
in
office
ending
this
war
let
me
be
clear
we
must
be
as
careful
getting
out
of
iraq
as
we
were
careless
getting
in
we
can
safely
redeploy
our
combat
brigades
at
pace
that
would
remove
them
in
months
that
would
be
the
summer
of
one
year
after
iraqi
security
forces
will
be
prepared
to
stand
up
two
years
from
now
and
more
than
seven
years
after
the
war
began
after
this
redeployment
we
keep
residual
force
to
perform
specific
missions
in
iraq
targeting
any
remnants
of
protecting
our
service
members
and
diplomats
and
training
and
supporting
iraq
security
forces
so
long
as
the
iraqis
make
political
progress
we
will
make
tactical
adjustments
as
we
implement
this
strategy
that
is
what
any
responsible
must
do
as
have
consistently
said
will
consult
with
commanders
on
the
ground
and
the
iraqi
government
we
will
redeploy
from
secure
areas
first
and
volatile
areas
later
we
will
commit
billion
to
meaningful
international
effort
to
support
the
more
than
million
displaced
iraqis
we
will
forge
new
coalition
to
support
iraq
future
one
that
includes
all
of
iraq
and
also
the
united
nations
the
world
bank
and
the
european
union
because
we
all
have
stake
in
stability
and
we
will
make
it
clear
that
the
united
states
seeks
no
permanent
bases
in
iraq
this
is
the
future
that
iraqis
want
this
is
the
future
that
the
american
people
want
and
this
is
what
our
common
interests
demand
both
america
and
iraq
will
be
more
secure
when
the
terrorist
in
is
taken
out
by
the
iraqi
army
and
the
criminal
in
baghdad
fears
iraqi
police
not
just
coalition
forces
both
america
and
iraq
will
succeed
when
every
arab
government
has
an
embassy
open
in
baghdad
and
the
child
in
benefits
from
services
provided
by
iraqi
dinars
not
american
tax
dollars
and
this
is
the
future
we
need
for
our
military
we
can
not
tolerate
this
strain
on
our
forces
to
fight
war
that
has
made
us
safer
will
restore
our
strength
by
ending
this
war
completing
the
increase
of
our
ground
forces
by
soldiers
and
marines
and
investing
in
the
capabilities
we
need
to
defeat
conventional
foes
and
meet
the
unconventional
challenges
of
our
time
so
let
be
clear
senator
would
have
our
troops
continue
to
fight
tour
after
tour
of
duty
and
our
taxpayers
keep
spending
billion
month
indefinitely
want
iraqis
to
take
responsibility
for
their
own
future
and
to
reach
the
political
accommodation
necessary
for
stability
that
victory
that
success
that
what
best
for
iraq
that
what
best
for
america
and
that
why
will
end
this
war
as
president
in
fact
as
should
have
been
apparent
to
president
bush
and
senator
the
central
front
in
the
war
on
terror
is
not
iraq
and
it
never
was
that
why
the
second
goal
of
my
new
strategy
will
be
taking
the
fight
to
in
and
pakistan
it
is
unacceptable
that
almost
seven
years
after
nearly
americans
were
killed
on
our
soil
the
terrorists
who
attacked
us
on
are
still
at
large
bin
laden
and
are
recording
messages
to
their
followers
and
plotting
more
terror
the
controls
parts
of
has
an
expanding
base
in
pakistan
that
is
probably
no
farther
from
their
old
afghan
sanctuary
than
train
ride
from
washington
to
if
another
attack
on
our
homeland
comes
it
will
likely
come
from
the
same
region
where
was
planned
and
yet
today
we
have
five
times
more
troops
in
iraq
than
senator
said
just
months
ago
that
is
not
in
trouble
because
of
our
diversion
to
iraq
could
not
disagree
more
our
troops
and
our
nato
allies
are
performing
heroically
in
but
have
argued
for
years
that
we
lack
the
resources
to
finish
the
job
because
of
our
commitment
to
iraq
that
what
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
said
earlier
this
month
and
that
why
as
president
will
make
the
fight
against
and
the
the
top
priority
that
it
should
be
this
is
war
that
we
have
to
win
will
send
at
least
two
additional
combat
brigades
to
and
use
this
commitment
to
seek
greater
contributions
with
fewer
restrictions
from
nato
allies
will
focus
on
training
afghan
security
forces
and
supporting
an
afghan
judiciary
with
more
resources
and
incentives
for
american
officers
who
perform
these
missions
just
as
we
succeeded
in
the
cold
war
by
supporting
allies
who
could
sustain
their
own
security
we
must
that
the
century
front
lines
are
not
only
on
the
field
of
battle
they
are
found
in
the
training
exercise
near
in
the
police
station
in
and
in
the
rule
of
law
in
moreover
lasting
security
will
only
come
if
we
heed
lesson
and
help
afghans
grow
their
economy
from
the
bottom
up
that
why
proposed
an
additional
billion
in
assistance
each
year
with
meaningful
safeguards
to
prevent
corruption
and
to
make
sure
investments
are
made
not
just
in
but
out
in
provinces
as
part
of
this
program
we
invest
in
alternative
livelihoods
to
for
afghan
farmers
just
as
we
crack
down
on
heroin
trafficking
we
can
not
lose
to
future
of
the
afghan
people
must
know
that
our
commitment
to
their
future
is
enduring
because
the
security
of
and
the
united
states
is
shared
the
greatest
threat
to
that
security
lies
in
the
tribal
regions
of
pakistan
where
terrorists
train
and
insurgents
strike
into
we
can
not
tolerate
terrorist
sanctuary
and
as
president
we
need
stronger
and
sustained
partnership
between
pakistan
and
nato
to
secure
the
border
to
take
out
terrorist
camps
and
to
crack
down
on
insurgents
we
need
more
troops
more
helicopters
more
satellites
more
predator
drones
in
the
afghan
border
region
and
we
must
make
it
clear
that
if
pakistan
can
not
or
will
not
act
we
will
take
out
terrorist
targets
like
bin
laden
if
we
have
them
in
our
sights
make
no
mistake
we
succeed
in
or
secure
our
homeland
unless
we
change
our
pakistan
policy
we
must
expect
more
of
the
government
but
we
must
offer
more
than
blank
check
to
general
who
has
lost
the
confidence
of
his
people
it
time
to
strengthen
stability
by
standing
up
for
the
aspirations
of
the
people
that
why
bill
with
and
to
triple
aid
to
the
people
and
to
sustain
it
for
decade
while
ensuring
that
the
military
assistance
we
do
provide
is
used
to
take
the
fight
to
the
and
we
must
move
beyond
purely
military
alliance
built
on
convenience
or
face
mounting
popular
opposition
in
nation
at
the
of
terror
and
radical
islam
only
strong
democracy
can
help
us
move
toward
my
third
goal
securing
all
nuclear
weapons
and
materials
from
terrorists
and
rogue
states
one
of
the
terrible
ironies
of
the
iraq
war
is
that
president
bush
used
the
threat
of
nuclear
terrorism
to
invade
country
that
had
no
active
nuclear
program
but
the
fact
that
the
president
misled
us
into
misguided
war
does
diminish
the
threat
of
terrorist
with
weapon
of
mass
destruction
in
fact
it
has
only
increased
it
in
those
years
after
world
war
we
worried
about
the
deadly
atom
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
kremlin
now
we
worry
about
tons
of
highly
enriched
uranium
some
of
it
poorly
secured
at
civilian
nuclear
facilities
in
over
forty
countries
now
we
worry
about
the
breakdown
of
framework
that
was
designed
for
the
bipolar
world
of
the
cold
war
now
we
worry
most
of
all
about
rogue
state
or
nuclear
scientist
transferring
the
world
deadliest
weapons
to
the
world
most
dangerous
people
terrorists
who
think
twice
about
killing
themselves
and
hundreds
of
thousands
in
or
moscow
in
london
or
new
york
we
can
not
wait
any
longer
to
protect
the
american
people
made
this
priority
in
the
senate
where
worked
with
republican
senator
to
pass
law
accelerating
our
pursuit
of
loose
nuclear
materials
lead
global
effort
to
secure
all
loose
nuclear
materials
around
the
world
during
my
first
term
as
president
and
develop
new
defenses
to
protect
against
the
century
threat
of
biological
weapons
and
threats
that
discuss
in
more
detail
tomorrow
beyond
taking
these
immediate
urgent
steps
it
time
to
send
clear
message
america
seeks
world
with
no
nuclear
weapons
as
long
as
nuclear
weapons
exist
we
must
retain
strong
deterrent
but
instead
of
threatening
to
kick
them
out
of
the
we
need
to
work
with
russia
to
take
and
russian
ballistic
missiles
off
trigger
alert
to
dramatically
reduce
the
stockpiles
of
our
nuclear
weapons
and
material
to
seek
global
ban
on
the
production
of
fissile
material
for
weapons
and
to
expand
the
ban
on
missiles
so
that
the
agreement
is
global
by
keeping
our
commitment
under
the
nuclear
treaty
we
be
in
better
position
to
press
nations
like
north
korea
and
iran
to
keep
theirs
in
particular
it
will
give
us
more
credibility
and
leverage
in
dealing
with
iran
we
can
not
tolerate
nuclear
weapons
in
the
hands
of
nations
that
support
terror
preventing
iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
is
vital
national
security
interest
of
the
united
states
no
tool
of
statecraft
should
be
taken
off
the
table
but
senator
would
continue
failed
policy
that
has
seen
iran
strengthen
its
position
advance
its
nuclear
program
and
stockpile
of
low
enriched
uranium
will
use
all
elements
of
american
power
to
pressure
the
iranian
regime
starting
with
aggressive
principled
and
direct
diplomacy
diplomacy
backed
with
strong
sanctions
and
without
preconditions
there
will
be
careful
preparation
commend
the
work
of
our
european
allies
on
this
important
matter
and
we
should
be
full
partners
in
that
effort
ultimately
the
measure
of
any
effort
is
whether
it
leads
to
change
in
iranian
that
why
we
must
pursue
these
tough
negotiations
in
full
coordination
with
our
allies
bringing
to
bear
our
full
influence
including
if
it
will
advance
our
interests
my
meeting
with
the
appropriate
iranian
leader
at
time
and
place
of
my
choosing
we
will
pursue
this
diplomacy
with
no
illusions
about
the
iranian
regime
instead
we
will
present
clear
choice
if
you
abandon
your
nuclear
program
support
for
terror
and
threats
to
israel
there
will
be
meaningful
incentives
if
you
refuse
then
we
will
up
the
pressure
with
stronger
unilateral
sanctions
stronger
multilateral
sanctions
in
the
security
council
and
sustained
action
outside
the
to
isolate
the
iranian
regime
that
the
diplomacy
we
need
and
the
iranians
should
negotiate
now
by
waiting
they
will
only
face
mounting
pressure
the
surest
way
to
increase
our
leverage
against
iran
in
the
run
is
to
stop
its
ambitions
that
will
depend
on
achieving
my
fourth
goal
ending
the
tyranny
of
oil
in
our
time
one
of
the
most
dangerous
weapons
in
the
world
today
is
the
price
of
oil
we
ship
nearly
million
day
to
unstable
or
hostile
nations
for
their
oil
it
pays
for
terrorist
bombs
going
off
from
baghdad
to
beirut
it
funds
in
and
radical
from
to
it
takes
leverage
away
from
america
and
shifts
it
to
dictators
this
immediate
danger
is
eclipsed
only
by
the
threat
from
climate
change
which
will
lead
to
devastating
weather
patterns
terrible
storms
drought
and
famine
that
means
people
competing
for
food
and
water
in
the
next
fifty
years
in
the
very
places
that
have
known
horrific
violence
in
the
last
fifty
africa
the
middle
east
and
south
asia
most
disastrously
that
could
mean
destructive
storms
on
our
shores
and
the
disappearance
of
our
coastline
this
is
not
just
an
economic
issue
or
an
environmental
concern
this
is
national
security
crisis
for
the
sake
of
our
security
and
for
every
american
family
that
is
paying
the
price
at
the
pump
we
must
end
this
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
as
president
that
exactly
what
do
small
steps
and
political
gimmickry
just
do
invest
billion
over
the
next
ten
years
to
put
america
on
the
path
to
true
energy
security
this
fund
will
fast
track
investments
in
new
green
energy
business
sector
that
will
end
our
addiction
to
oil
and
create
up
to
million
jobs
over
the
next
two
decades
and
help
secure
the
future
of
our
country
and
our
planet
we
invest
in
research
and
development
of
every
form
of
alternative
energy
solar
wind
and
as
well
as
technologies
that
can
make
coal
clean
and
nuclear
power
safe
and
from
the
moment
take
office
will
let
it
be
known
that
the
united
states
of
america
is
ready
to
lead
again
never
again
will
we
sit
on
the
sidelines
or
stand
in
the
way
of
global
action
to
tackle
this
global
challenge
will
reach
out
to
the
leaders
of
the
biggest
carbon
emitting
nations
and
ask
them
to
join
new
global
energy
forum
that
will
lay
the
foundation
for
the
next
generation
of
climate
protocols
we
will
also
build
an
alliance
of
nations
and
work
together
to
reduce
our
demand
and
to
break
the
grip
of
on
the
global
economy
we
set
goal
of
an
reduction
in
global
emissions
by
and
as
we
develop
new
forms
of
clean
energy
here
at
home
we
will
share
our
technology
and
our
innovations
with
all
the
nations
of
the
world
that
is
the
tradition
of
american
leadership
on
behalf
of
the
global
good
and
that
will
be
my
fifth
goal
rebuilding
our
alliances
to
meet
the
common
challenges
of
the
century
for
all
of
our
power
america
is
strongest
when
we
act
alongside
strong
partners
we
faced
down
fascism
with
the
greatest
alliance
the
world
has
ever
known
we
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
our
nato
allies
against
the
soviet
threat
and
paid
far
smaller
price
for
the
first
gulf
war
because
we
acted
together
with
broad
coalition
we
helped
create
the
united
nations
not
to
constrain
america
influence
but
to
amplify
it
by
advancing
our
values
now
is
the
time
for
new
era
of
international
cooperation
it
time
for
america
and
europe
to
renew
our
common
commitment
to
face
down
the
threats
of
the
century
just
as
we
did
the
challenges
of
the
it
time
to
strengthen
our
partnerships
with
japan
south
korea
and
the
world
largest
democracy
india
to
create
stable
and
prosperous
asia
it
time
to
engage
china
on
common
interests
like
climate
change
even
as
we
continue
to
encourage
their
shift
to
more
open
and
society
it
time
to
strengthen
nato
by
asking
more
of
our
allies
while
always
approaching
them
with
the
respect
owed
partner
it
time
to
reform
the
united
nations
so
that
this
imperfect
institution
can
become
more
perfect
forum
to
share
burdens
strengthen
our
leverage
and
promote
our
values
it
time
to
deepen
our
engagement
to
help
resolve
the
israeli
conflict
so
that
we
help
our
ally
israel
achieve
true
and
lasting
security
while
helping
achieve
their
legitimate
aspirations
for
statehood
and
just
as
we
renew
longstanding
efforts
so
must
we
shape
new
ones
to
meet
new
challenges
that
why
create
shared
security
partnership
program
new
alliance
of
nations
to
strengthen
cooperative
efforts
to
take
down
global
terrorist
networks
while
standing
up
against
torture
and
brutality
that
why
we
work
with
the
african
union
to
enhance
its
ability
to
keep
the
peace
that
why
we
build
new
partnership
to
roll
back
the
trafficking
of
drugs
and
guns
and
gangs
in
the
that
what
we
can
do
if
we
are
ready
to
engage
the
world
we
will
have
to
provide
meaningful
resources
to
meet
critical
priorities
know
development
assistance
is
not
the
most
popular
program
but
as
president
will
make
the
case
to
the
american
people
that
it
can
be
our
best
investment
in
increasing
the
common
security
of
the
entire
world
that
was
true
with
the
plan
and
that
must
be
true
today
that
why
double
our
foreign
assistance
to
billion
by
and
use
it
to
support
stable
future
in
failing
states
and
sustainable
growth
in
africa
to
halve
global
poverty
and
to
roll
back
disease
to
send
once
more
message
to
those
yearning
faces
beyond
our
shores
that
says
you
matter
to
us
your
future
is
our
future
and
our
moment
is
now
this
must
be
the
moment
when
we
answer
the
call
of
history
for
eight
years
we
have
paid
the
price
for
foreign
policy
that
lectures
without
listening
that
divides
us
from
one
another
and
from
the
world
instead
of
calling
us
to
common
purpose
that
focuses
on
our
tactics
in
fighting
war
without
end
in
iraq
instead
of
forging
new
strategy
to
face
down
the
true
threats
that
we
face
we
can
not
afford
four
more
years
of
strategy
that
is
out
of
balance
and
out
of
step
with
this
defining
moment
none
of
this
will
be
easy
but
we
have
faced
great
odds
before
when
general
first
spoke
about
the
plan
that
would
bear
his
name
the
rubble
of
berlin
had
not
yet
been
built
into
wall
but
knew
that
even
the
fiercest
of
adversaries
could
forge
bonds
of
friendship
founded
in
freedom
he
had
the
confidence
to
know
that
the
purpose
and
pragmatism
of
the
american
people
could
outlast
any
foe
today
the
dangers
and
divisions
that
came
with
the
dawn
of
the
cold
war
have
receded
now
the
defeat
of
the
threats
of
the
past
has
been
replaced
by
the
transnational
threats
of
today
we
know
what
is
needed
we
know
what
can
best
be
done
we
know
what
must
done
now
it
falls
to
us
to
act
with
the
same
sense
of
purpose
and
pragmatism
as
an
earlier
generation
to
join
with
friends
and
partners
to
lead
the
world
anew

contests

the
steps
of
the
old
state
capitol
in
illinois
thousands
of
miles
have
been
millions
of
voices

been
heard
and
because
of
what
you
said

you
decided
that
change
must
come
to
washington

this
year
must
be
different
than
all
the
rest

to
your
doubts
or
your
fears
but
to
your
greatest
hopes
and
highest
aspirations
tonight
we
mark
the
end
of
one
historic
journey
with
the
beginning
of
another
journey
journey
that
will
bring
new
and
better
day
to
america
because
of
you

of
cedar

to
the
sunshine
of

took
this
journey
with
me
as
fellow
candidates
for
president
you
know
at
this
defining
moment
at
this
defining
moment
for
our
nation
we
should
be
proud
that
our
party
put
forth
one
of
the
most
talented
qualified
field
of
individuals
ever
to
run
for
office
have
not
just
competed
with
them
as
rivals
learned
from
them
as
friends
as
public
servants
and
as
patriots
who
love
america
and
are
willing
to
work
tirelessly
to
make
this
country
better
they
are
leaders
of
this
party
and
leaders
that
america
will
turn
to
for
years
to
come
and
that
is
particularly
true
for
the
candidate
who
has
further
on
this
journey
than
anyone
else
senator
has
made
history
in
this
campaign
she
has
made
history
not
not
just
because
woman
who
has
done
what
no
woman
has
done
before
but
because
she
is
leader
who
inspires
millions
of
americans
with
her
strength
her
courage
and
her
commitment
to
the
causes
that
brought
us
here
tonight
congratulate
her
on
her
victory
in
south
and
congratulate
her
on
the
race
that
she
has
run
throughout
this
contest
certainly
had
our
differences
over
the
last
months
but
as
someone
shared
stage
with
her
many
times
can
tell
you
that
what
gets
up
in
the
morning
even
in
the
face
of
tough
odds
is
exactly
what
sent
her
and
bill
to
sign
up
for
their
first
campaign
in
texas
all
those
years
ago
what
sent
her
to
work
at
the
fund
and
made
her
fight
for
health
care
as
first
lady
what
led
her
to
the
united
states
senate
and
her
campaign
for
the
presidency
an
unyielding
desire
to
improve
the
lives
of
ordinary
americans
no
matter
how
difficult
the
fight
may
be
and
you
can
rest
assured
that
when
we
finally
win
the
battle
for
universal
health
care
in
this
country
and
we
will
win
that
fight
she
will
be
central
to
that
victory
when
we
transform
our
energy
policy
and
lift
our
children
out
of
poverty
it
will
be
because
she
worked
to
help
make
it
happen
our
party
and
our
country
are
better
off
because
of
her
and
am
better
candidate
for
having
had
the
to
compete
with
there
are
those
who
say
that
this
primary
has
somehow
left
us
weaker
and
more
divided
well
say
that
because
of
this
primary
there
are
millions
of
americans
who
cast
their
ballot
for
the
very
first
time
there
are
there
are
independents
and
republicans
who
understand
this
election
just
about
change
of
party
in
washington
but
also
about
the
need
to
change
washington
there
are
there
are
young
people
and
and
and
women
of
all
ages
who
have
voted
in
numbers
that
have
broken
records
and
inspired
nation
all
of
you
chose
to
support
candidate
you
believe
in
deeply
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
the
reason
you
came
out
and
waited
in
lines
that
stretched
block
after
block
to
make
your
voice
heard
you
do
that
you
do
that
because
of
me
or
senator
or
anyone
else
you
did
it
because
you
know
in
your
hearts
that
at
this
moment
moment
that
will
define
generation
we
can
not
afford
to
keep
doing
what
been
doing
we
owe
our
children
better
future
we
owe
our
country
better
future
and
for
all
those
who
dream
of
that
future
tonight
say
let
us
begin
the
work
together
let
us
unite
in
common
effort
to
chart
new
course
for
america
in
just
in
just
few
short
months
the
republican
party
will
arrive
in
paul
with
very
different
agenda
they
will
they
will
come
here
to
nominate
john
man
who
has
served
this
country
heroically
we
the
service
of
john
and
respect
his
many
accomplishments
even
if
he
chooses
to
deny
mine
my
my
differences
with
him
my
differences
with
him
are
not
personal
they
are
with
the
policies
he
has
proposed
in
this
campaign
because
while
john
can
legitimately
tout
moments
of
independence
from
his
party
in
the
past
such
independence
has
not
been
the
hallmark
of
his
presidential
campaign
not
change
when
john
decided
to
stand
with
george
bush
percent
of
the
time
as
he
did
in
the
senate
last
year
not
change
when
he
offers
four
more
years
of
bush
economic
policies
that
have
failed
to
create
jobs
or
insure
our
workers
or
help
americans
afford
the
cost
of
college
policies
that
have
lowered
the
real
incomes
of
the
average
american
family
and
widened
the
gap
between
wall
street
and
main
street
and
left
our
children
with
mountain
of
debt
not
change
when
he
promises
to
continue
policy
in
iraq
that
asks
everything
of
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
nothing
of
iraqi
politicians
policy
where
all
we
look
for
are
reasons
to
stay
in
iraq
while
we
spend
billions
of
dollars
month
on
war
that
making
the
american
people
any
safer
so
so
say
this
there
are
many
words
to
describe
john
attempt
to
pass
off
his
embrace
of
george
policies
as
bipartisan
and
new
but
is
not
one
of
them
is
not
one
of
them
because
change
is
foreign
policy
that
begin
and
end
with
war
that
never
been
and
never
been
waged
stand
here
and
pretend
that
there
are
many
good
options
left
in
iraq
but
not
an
option
is
leaving
our
troops
in
that
country
for
the
next
hundred
years
especially
at
time
when
our
military
is
overstretched
our
nation
is
isolated
and
nearly
every
other
threat
to
america
is
being
ignored
we
we
must
be
we
must
be
as
careful
getting
out
of
iraq
as
we
were
careless
getting
in
but
we
but
start
leaving
we
must
time
for
iraqis
to
take
responsibility
for
their
future
time
to
rebuild
our
military
and
give
our
veterans
the
care
and
the
benefits
they
deserve
when
they
come
home
time
it
time
to
refocus
our
efforts
on
leadership
and
and
rally
the
world
against
the
common
threats
of
the
century
terrorism
and
nuclear
weapons
climate
change
and
poverty
genocide
and
disease
what
change
is
change
change
is
that
meetings
sic
threats
requires
not
just
our
firepower
but
the
power
of
our
diplomacy
tough
tough
direct
diplomacy
where
the
president
of
the
united
states
afraid
to
let
any
petty
dictator
know
where
america
stands
and
what
we
stand
for
we
must
once
again
have
the
courage
and
the
conviction
to
lead
the
free
world
that
is
the
legacy
of
and
and
kennedy
what
the
american
people
demand
what
change
is
change
is
building
an
economy
that
rewards
not
just
wealth
but
the
work
and
the
workers
who
created
it
understanding
that
the
struggles
facing
working
families
be
solved
by
spending
billions
of
dollars
on
more
tax
breaks
for
big
corporations
and
wealthy
but
by
giving
tax
break
to
those
who
need
it
and
investing
in
our
crumbling
infrastructure
and
transforming
how
we
use
energy
and
improving
our
schools
and
renewing
our
commitment
to
science
and
innovation
understanding
that
fiscal
responsibility
and
shared
prosperity
can
go
as
they
did
when
bill
was
president
john
has
spent
lot
of
time
talking
about
trips
to
iraq
in
the
last
few
weeks
but
maybe
if
he
spent
some
time
taking
trips
to
the
cities
and
towns
that
have
been
hardest
hit
by
this
economy
cities
in
michigan
and
ohio
and
right
here
in
understand
the
kind
of
change
that
people
are
looking
for
maybe
if
he
went
to
and
met
the
student
who
works
the
night
shift
after
full
day
of
class
and
still
pay
the
medical
bills
for
sister
ill
understand
she
afford
four
more
years
of
health
care
plan
that
only
takes
care
of
the
healthy
and
the
wealthy
she
needs
us
to
pass
health
care
right
now
plan
that
guarantees
insurance
to
every
american
who
wants
it
and
brings
down
premiums
for
every
family
who
needs
it
the
change
we
need
maybe
maybe
if
john
went
to
and
he
met
the
man
who
lost
his
job
but
even
afford
the
gas
to
drive
around
and
look
for
new
one
understand
we
afford
four
more
years
of
our
addiction
to
oil
from
dictators
that
man
needs
us
to
pass
an
energy
policy
that
works
with
to
raise
fuel
standards
and
makes
corporations
pay
for
their
pollution
and
oil
companies
invest
their
record
profits
in
clean
energy
future
an
energy
policy
that
will
create
millions
of
new
jobs
that
pay
well
and
be
the
change
we
need
and
maybe
if
john
spent
some
time
in
the
schools
of
south
or
paul
or
where
he
spoke
tonight
in
new
understand
that
we
afford
to
leave
the
money
behind
for
no
child
left
behind
that
we
owe
it
to
our
children
to
invest
in
education
and
recruit
an
army
of
new
teachers
and
give
them
better
pay
and
more
support
and
finally
decide
that
in
this
global
economy
the
chance
to
get
college
education
should
not
be
privilege
for
the
few
but
birthright
of
every
american
the
change
we
need
in
america
why
running
for
president
of
the
united
states
now
now
the
other
side
will
come
here
in
september
and
offer
very
different
set
of
policies
and
positions
and
that
is
good
thing
that
is
debate
look
forward
to
it
is
debate
that
the
american
people
deserve
on
the
issues
that
will
help
determine
the
future
of
this
country
and
the
future
for
our
children
but
what
you
deserve
is
another
election
governed
by
fear
and
innuendo
and
division
what
you
hear
from
this
campaign
or
this
party
is
the
kind
of
politics
that
uses
religion
as
wedge
and
patriotism
as
bludgeon
what
you
see
from
this
campaign
or
this
party
is
politics
that
sees
our
opponents
not
as
competitors
to
challenge
but
enemies
to
because
we
may
call
ourselves
democrats
and
republicans
but
we
are
americans
first
we
are
always
americans
first
despite
despite
what
the
good
senator
from
arizona
may
have
said
tonight
seen
people
of
differing
views
and
opinions
find
common
cause
many
times
during
my
two
decades
in
public
life
and
brought
many
together
myself
walked
with
community
leaders
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
and
watched
tensions
fade
as
black
and
white
and
latino
fought
together
for
good
jobs
and
good
schools
sat
across
the
table
from
law
enforcement
officials
and
civil
rights
advocates
to
reform
criminal
justice
system
that
sent
innocent
people
to
death
row
worked
with
friends
in
the
other
party
to
provide
more
children
with
health
insurance
and
more
working
families
with
tax
break
to
curb
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
ensure
that
the
american
people
know
where
their
tax
dollars
are
being
spent
and
to
reduce
the
influence
of
lobbyists
who
have
all
too
often
set
the
agenda
in
washington
in
our
country
in
our
country
have
found
that
this
cooperation
happens
not
because
we
agree
on
everything
but
because
behind
all
the
false
labels
and
false
divisions
and
categories
that
define
us
beyond
all
the
petty
bickering
and
in
washington
americans
are
decent
generous
compassionate
people
united
by
common
challenges
and
common
hopes
and
every
so
often
there
are
moments
which
call
on
that
fundamental
goodness
to
make
this
country
great
again
so
it
was
for
that
band
of
patriots
who
declared
in
hall
the
formation
of
more
perfect
union
and
for
all
those
who
gave
on
the
fields
of
and
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
to
save
that
same
union
so
it
was
for
the
greatest
generation
that
conquered
fear
itself
and
liberated
continent
from
tyranny
and
made
this
country
home
to
untold
opportunity
and
prosperity
so
it
was
for
the
workers
who
stood
out
on
the
picket
lines
the
women
who
shattered
glass
ceilings
the
children
who
braved
bridge
for
cause
so
it
has
been
for
every
generation
that
faced
down
the
greatest
challenges
and
the
most
improbable
odds
to
leave
their
children
world
better
and
kinder
and
more
just
and
so
it
must
be
for
us
america
this
is
our
moment
this
is
our
time
our
time
to
turn
the
page
on
the
policies
of
the
past
our
time
to
bring
new
energy
and
new
ideas
to
the
challenges
we
face
our
time
to
offer
new
direction
for
this
country
that
we
love
the
journey
will
be
difficult
the
road
will
be
long
face
this
challenge
face
this
challenge
with
profound
humility
and
knowledge
of
my
own
limitations
but
also
face
it
with
limitless
faith
in
the
capacity
of
the
american
people
because
if
we
are
willing
to
work
for
it
and
fight
for
it
and
believe
in
it
then
am
absolutely
certain
that
generations
from
now
we
will
be
able
to
look
back
and
tell
our
children
that
this
was
the
moment
when
we
began
to
provide
care
for
the
sick
and
good
jobs
to
the
jobless
this
was
the
moment
when
the
rise
of
the
oceans
began
to
slow
and
our
planet
began
to
heal
this
was
the
moment
when
we
ended
war
and
secured
our
nation
and
restored
our
image
as
the
last
best
hope
on
earth
this
was
the
moment
this
was
the
time
when
we
came
together
to
remake
this
great
nation
so
that
it
may
always
reflect
our
very
best
selves
and
our
highest
ideals
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
thank
you
let
me
begin
by
thanking
for
his
contributions
to
this
country
in
so
many
different
ways
he
exemplifies
what
we
mean
by
the
word
citizen
and
so
we
are
very
grateful
to
him
for
all
the
work
he
has
done
and
thankful
for
the
gracious
and
thoughtful
introduction
we
the
people
in
order
to
form
more
perfect
union
two
hundred
and
twenty
one
years
ago
in
hall
that
still
stands
across
the
street
group
of
men
gathered
and
with
these
simple
words
launched
america
improbable
experiment
in
democracy
farmers
and
scholars
statesmen
and
patriots
who
had
across
the
ocean
to
escape
tyranny
and
persecution
finally
made
real
their
declaration
of
independence
at
convention
that
lasted
through
the
spring
of
the
document
they
produced
was
eventually
signed
but
ultimately
unfinished
it
was
stained
by
this
nation
original
sin
of
slavery
question
that
divided
the
colonies
and
brought
the
convention
to
stalemate
until
the
founders
chose
to
allow
the
slave
trade
to
continue
for
at
least
more
years
and
to
leave
any
final
resolution
to
future
generations
of
course
the
answer
to
the
slavery
question
was
already
embedded
within
our
constitution
constitution
that
had
at
is
very
core
the
ideal
of
equal
citizenship
under
the
law
constitution
that
promised
its
people
liberty
and
justice
and
union
that
could
be
and
should
be
perfected
over
time
and
yet
words
on
parchment
would
not
be
enough
to
deliver
slaves
from
bondage
or
provide
men
and
women
of
every
and
creed
their
full
rights
and
obligations
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
what
would
be
needed
were
americans
in
successive
generations
who
were
willing
to
do
their
part
through
protests
and
struggles
on
the
streets
and
in
the
courts
through
civil
war
and
civil
disobedience
and
always
at
great
risk
to
narrow
that
gap
between
the
promise
of
our
ideals
and
the
reality
of
their
time
this
was
one
of
the
tasks
we
set
forth
at
the
beginning
of
this
presidential
campaign
to
continue
the
long
march
of
those
who
came
before
us
march
for
more
just
more
equal
more
free
more
caring
and
more
prosperous
america
chose
to
run
for
president
at
this
moment
in
history
because
believe
deeply
that
we
can
not
solve
the
challenges
of
our
time
unless
we
solve
them
together
unless
we
perfect
our
union
by
understanding
that
we
may
have
different
stories
but
we
hold
common
hopes
that
we
may
not
look
the
same
and
may
not
have
come
from
the
same
place
but
we
all
want
to
move
in
the
same
direction
towards
better
future
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
and
this
belief
comes
from
my
unyielding
faith
in
the
decency
and
generosity
of
the
american
people
but
it
also
comes
from
my
own
story
the
son
of
black
man
from
kenya
and
white
woman
from
was
raised
with
the
help
of
white
grandfather
who
survived
depression
to
serve
in
army
during
world
war
and
white
grandmother
who
worked
on
bomber
assembly
line
at
fort
while
he
was
overseas
gone
to
some
of
the
best
schools
in
america
and
lived
in
one
of
the
world
poorest
nations
am
married
to
black
american
who
carries
within
her
the
blood
of
slaves
and
slave
owners
an
inheritance
we
pass
on
to
our
two
precious
daughters
have
brothers
sisters
nieces
nephews
uncles
and
cousins
of
every
race
and
every
hue
scattered
across
three
continents
and
for
as
long
as
live
will
never
forget
that
in
no
other
country
on
earth
is
my
story
even
possible
it
story
that
has
made
me
the
most
conventional
of
candidates
but
it
is
story
that
has
seared
into
my
genetic
makeup
the
idea
that
this
nation
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
that
out
of
many
we
are
truly
one
now
throughout
the
first
year
of
this
campaign
against
all
predictions
to
the
contrary
we
saw
how
hungry
the
american
people
were
for
this
message
of
unity
despite
the
temptation
to
view
my
candidacy
through
purely
racial
lens
we
won
commanding
victories
in
states
with
some
of
the
whitest
populations
in
the
country
in
south
where
the
confederate
flag
still
flies
we
built
powerful
coalition
of
african
americans
and
white
americans
this
is
not
to
say
that
race
has
not
been
an
issue
in
this
campaign
at
various
stages
in
the
campaign
some
commentators
have
deemed
me
either
too
black
or
not
black
enough
we
saw
racial
tensions
bubble
to
the
surface
during
the
week
before
the
south
primary
the
press
has
scoured
every
single
exit
poll
for
the
latest
evidence
of
racial
not
just
in
terms
of
white
and
black
but
black
and
brown
as
well
and
yet
it
only
been
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
that
the
discussion
of
race
in
this
campaign
has
taken
particularly
divisive
turn
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
we
heard
the
implication
that
my
candidacy
is
somehow
an
exercise
in
affirmative
action
that
it
based
solely
on
the
desire
of
wild
and
liberals
to
purchase
racial
reconciliation
on
the
cheap
on
the
other
end
we
heard
my
former
pastor
jeremiah
wright
use
incendiary
language
to
express
views
that
have
the
potential
not
only
to
widen
the
racial
divide
but
views
that
denigrate
both
the
greatness
and
the
goodness
of
our
nation
and
that
rightly
offend
white
and
black
alike
now
already
condemned
in
unequivocal
terms
the
statements
of
reverend
wright
that
have
caused
such
controversy
and
in
some
cases
pain
for
some
nagging
questions
remain
did
know
him
to
be
an
occasionally
fierce
critic
of
american
domestic
and
foreign
policy
of
course
did
ever
hear
him
make
remarks
that
could
be
considered
controversial
while
sat
in
the
church
yes
did
strongly
disagree
with
many
of
his
political
views
absolutely
just
as
sure
many
of
you
have
heard
remarks
from
your
pastors
priests
or
rabbis
with
which
you
strongly
disagree
but
the
remarks
that
have
caused
this
recent
were
simply
controversial
they
were
simply
religious
leader
efforts
to
speak
out
against
perceived
injustice
instead
they
expressed
profoundly
distorted
view
of
this
country
view
that
sees
white
racism
as
endemic
and
that
elevates
what
is
wrong
with
america
above
all
that
we
know
is
right
with
america
view
that
sees
the
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
as
rooted
primarily
in
the
actions
of
stalwart
allies
like
israel
instead
of
emanating
from
the
perverse
and
hateful
ideologies
of
radical
islam
as
such
reverend
wright
comments
were
not
only
wrong
but
divisive
divisive
at
time
when
we
need
unity
racially
charged
at
time
when
we
need
to
come
together
to
solve
set
of
monumental
problems
two
wars
terrorist
threat
falling
economy
chronic
health
care
crisis
and
potentially
devastating
climate
change
problems
that
are
neither
black
or
white
or
latino
or
asian
but
rather
problems
that
confront
us
all
given
my
background
my
politics
and
my
professed
values
and
ideals
there
will
no
doubt
be
those
for
whom
my
statements
of
condemnation
are
not
enough
why
associate
myself
with
reverend
wright
in
the
first
place
they
may
ask
why
not
join
another
church
and
confess
that
if
all
that
knew
of
reverend
wright
were
the
snippets
of
those
sermons
that
have
run
in
an
endless
loop
on
the
television
sets
and
if
trinity
united
church
of
christ
conformed
to
the
caricatures
being
peddled
by
some
commentators
there
is
no
doubt
that
would
react
in
much
the
same
way
but
the
truth
is
that
is
all
that
know
of
the
man
the
man
met
more
than
twenty
years
ago
is
man
who
helped
introduce
me
to
my
christian
faith
man
who
spoke
to
me
about
our
obligations
to
love
one
another
to
care
for
the
sick
and
lift
up
the
poor
he
is
man
who
served
his
country
as
united
states
marine
and
who
has
studied
and
lectured
at
some
of
the
finest
universities
and
seminaries
in
the
country
and
who
over
years
has
led
church
that
serves
the
community
by
doing
god
work
here
on
earth
by
housing
the
homeless
ministering
to
the
needy
providing
day
care
services
and
scholarships
and
prison
ministries
and
reaching
out
to
those
suffering
from
in
my
first
book
dreams
from
my
father
described
the
experience
of
my
first
service
at
trinity
and
it
goes
as
follows
people
began
to
shout
to
rise
from
their
seats
and
clap
and
cry
out
forceful
wind
carrying
the
reverend
voice
up
to
the
rafters
and
in
that
single
note
hope
heard
something
else
at
the
foot
of
that
cross
inside
the
thousands
of
churches
across
the
city
imagined
the
stories
of
ordinary
black
people
merging
with
the
stories
of
david
and
goliath
moses
and
pharaoh
the
in
the
lion
den
field
of
dry
bones
those
stories
of
survival
and
freedom
and
hope
became
our
stories
my
story
the
blood
that
spilled
was
our
blood
the
tears
our
tears
until
this
black
church
on
this
bright
day
seemed
once
more
vessel
carrying
the
story
of
people
into
future
generations
and
into
larger
world
our
trials
and
triumphs
became
at
once
unique
and
universal
black
and
more
than
black
in
chronicling
our
journey
the
stories
and
songs
gave
us
meaning
to
reclaim
memories
that
we
did
need
to
feel
shame
about
memories
that
all
people
might
study
and
cherish
and
with
which
we
could
start
to
rebuild
that
has
been
my
experience
at
trinity
like
other
predominantly
black
churches
across
the
country
trinity
embodies
the
black
community
in
its
entirety
the
doctor
and
the
welfare
mom
the
model
student
and
the
former
like
other
black
churches
trinity
services
are
full
of
raucous
laughter
and
sometimes
bawdy
they
are
full
of
dancing
and
clapping
and
screaming
and
shouting
that
may
seem
jarring
to
the
untrained
ear
the
church
contains
in
full
the
kindness
and
cruelty
the
fierce
intelligence
and
the
shocking
ignorance
the
struggles
and
successes
the
love
and
yes
the
bitterness
and
biases
that
make
up
the
black
experience
in
america
and
this
helps
explain
perhaps
my
relationship
with
reverend
wright
as
imperfect
as
he
may
be
he
has
been
like
family
to
me
he
strengthens
my
faith
officiated
my
wedding
and
my
children
not
once
in
my
conversations
with
him
have
heard
him
talk
about
any
ethnic
group
in
derogatory
terms
or
treat
whites
with
whom
he
interacted
with
anything
but
courtesy
and
respect
he
contains
within
him
the
contradictions
the
good
and
the
bad
of
the
community
that
he
has
served
diligently
for
so
many
years
can
no
more
disown
him
than
can
disown
the
black
community
can
no
more
disown
him
than
can
disown
my
white
grandmother
woman
who
helped
raise
me
woman
who
sacrificed
again
and
again
for
me
woman
who
loves
me
as
much
as
she
loves
anything
in
this
world
but
woman
who
once
confessed
her
fear
of
black
men
who
passed
her
by
on
the
street
and
who
on
more
than
one
occasion
has
uttered
racial
or
ethnic
stereotypes
that
made
me
cringe
these
people
are
part
of
me
and
they
are
part
of
america
this
country
that
love
now
some
will
see
this
as
an
attempt
to
justify
or
excuse
comments
that
are
simply
inexcusable
can
assure
you
it
is
not
and
suppose
the
politically
safe
thing
to
do
would
be
to
move
on
from
this
episode
and
just
hope
that
it
fades
into
the
woodwork
we
can
dismiss
reverend
wright
as
crank
or
demagogue
just
as
some
have
dismissed
in
the
aftermath
of
her
recent
statements
as
some
deep
bias
but
race
is
an
issue
that
believe
this
nation
can
not
afford
to
ignore
right
now
we
would
be
making
the
same
mistake
that
reverend
wright
made
in
his
offending
sermons
about
america
to
simplify
and
stereotype
and
amplify
the
negative
to
the
point
that
it
distorts
reality
the
fact
is
that
the
comments
that
have
been
made
and
the
issues
that
have
surfaced
over
the
last
few
weeks
reflect
the
complexities
of
race
in
this
country
that
we
never
really
worked
through
part
of
our
union
that
we
have
not
yet
made
perfect
and
if
we
walk
away
now
if
we
simply
retreat
into
our
respective
corners
we
will
never
be
able
to
come
together
and
solve
challenges
like
health
care
or
education
or
the
need
to
find
good
jobs
for
every
american
understanding
understanding
this
reality
requires
reminder
of
how
we
arrived
at
this
point
as
once
wrote
the
past
is
dead
and
buried
in
fact
it
is
even
past
we
do
not
need
to
recite
here
the
history
of
racial
injustice
in
this
country
but
we
do
need
to
remind
ourselves
that
so
many
of
the
disparities
that
exist
between
the
community
and
the
larger
american
community
today
can
be
traced
directly
to
inequalities
passed
on
from
an
earlier
generation
that
suffered
under
the
brutal
legacy
of
slavery
and
crow
segregated
schools
were
and
are
inferior
schools
we
still
have
fixed
them
years
after
brown
versus
board
of
education
and
the
inferior
education
they
provided
then
and
now
helps
explain
the
pervasive
achievement
gap
between
today
black
and
white
students
discrimination
where
blacks
were
prevented
often
through
violence
from
owning
property
or
loans
were
not
granted
to
business
owners
or
black
homeowners
could
not
access
mortgages
or
blacks
were
excluded
from
unions
or
the
police
force
or
the
fire
department
meant
that
black
families
could
not
amass
any
meaningful
wealth
to
bequeath
to
future
generations
that
history
helps
explain
the
wealth
and
income
gap
between
blacks
and
whites
and
the
concentrated
pockets
of
poverty
that
persist
in
so
many
of
today
urban
and
rural
communities
lack
of
economic
opportunity
among
black
men
and
the
shame
and
frustration
that
came
from
not
being
able
to
provide
for
one
family
contributed
to
the
erosion
of
black
families
problem
that
welfare
policies
for
many
years
may
have
worsened
and
the
lack
of
basic
services
in
so
many
urban
black
parks
for
kids
to
play
in
police
walking
the
beat
regular
garbage
building
code
enforcement
all
helped
create
cycle
of
violence
blight
and
neglect
that
continues
to
haunt
us
this
is
the
reality
in
which
reverend
wright
and
other
of
his
generation
grew
up
they
came
of
age
in
the
late
and
early
time
when
segregation
was
still
the
law
of
the
land
and
opportunity
was
systematically
constricted
what
remarkable
is
not
how
many
failed
in
the
face
of
discrimination
but
how
many
men
and
women
overcame
the
odds
how
many
were
able
to
make
way
out
of
no
way
for
those
like
me
who
would
come
after
them
but
for
all
those
who
scratched
and
clawed
their
way
to
get
piece
of
the
american
dream
there
were
many
who
did
make
it
those
who
were
ultimately
defeated
in
one
way
or
another
by
discrimination
that
legacy
of
defeat
was
passed
on
to
future
generations
those
young
men
and
increasingly
young
women
who
we
see
standing
on
street
corners
or
languishing
in
our
prisons
without
hope
or
prospects
for
the
future
even
for
those
blacks
who
did
make
it
questions
of
race
and
racism
continue
to
define
their
world
view
in
fundamental
ways
for
the
men
and
women
of
reverend
wright
generation
the
memories
of
humiliation
and
doubt
and
fear
have
not
gone
away
nor
has
the
anger
and
the
bitterness
of
those
years
that
anger
may
not
get
expressed
in
public
in
front
of
white
or
white
friends
but
it
does
find
voice
in
the
or
the
beauty
shop
or
around
the
kitchen
table
at
times
that
anger
is
exploited
by
politicians
to
gin
up
votes
along
racial
lines
or
to
make
up
for
politician
own
failings
and
occasionally
it
finds
voice
in
the
church
on
sunday
morning
in
the
pulpit
and
in
the
pews
the
fact
that
so
many
people
are
surprised
to
hear
that
anger
in
some
of
reverend
wright
sermons
simply
reminds
us
of
that
old
truism
that
the
most
segregated
hour
of
american
life
occurs
on
sunday
morning
that
that
anger
is
not
always
productive
indeed
all
too
often
it
distracts
attention
from
solving
real
problems
it
keeps
us
from
squarely
facing
our
own
complicity
within
the
community
in
our
own
condition
it
prevents
the
community
from
forging
the
alliances
it
needs
to
bring
about
real
change
but
the
anger
is
real
it
is
powerful
and
to
simply
wish
it
away
to
condemn
it
without
understanding
its
roots
only
serves
to
widen
the
chasm
of
misunderstanding
that
exists
between
the
races
in
fact
similar
anger
exists
within
segments
of
the
white
community
most
working
and
white
americans
do
feel
that
they
been
particularly
privileged
by
their
race
their
experience
is
the
immigrant
experience
as
far
as
they
concerned
no
one
handed
them
anything
they
built
it
from
scratch
they
worked
hard
all
their
lives
many
times
only
to
see
their
jobs
shipped
overseas
or
their
pensions
dumped
after
lifetime
of
they
are
anxious
about
their
futures
and
they
feel
their
dreams
slipping
away
and
in
an
era
of
stagnant
wages
and
global
competition
opportunity
comes
to
be
seen
as
zero
sum
game
in
which
your
dreams
come
at
my
expense
so
when
they
are
told
to
bus
their
children
to
school
across
town
when
they
hear
that
an
african
american
is
getting
an
advantage
in
landing
good
job
or
spot
in
good
college
because
of
an
injustice
that
they
themselves
never
committed
when
they
told
that
their
fears
about
crime
in
urban
are
somehow
prejudice
resentment
builds
over
time
like
the
anger
within
the
black
community
these
resentments
are
always
expressed
in
polite
company
but
they
have
helped
shape
the
political
landscape
for
at
least
generation
anger
over
welfare
and
affirmative
action
helped
forge
the
coalition
politicians
routinely
exploited
fears
of
crime
for
their
own
electoral
ends
talk
show
hosts
and
conservative
commentators
built
entire
careers
bogus
claims
of
racism
while
dismissing
legitimate
discussions
of
racial
injustice
and
inequality
as
mere
political
correctness
or
reverse
racism
and
just
as
black
anger
often
proved
counterproductive
so
have
these
white
resentments
distracted
attention
from
the
real
culprits
of
the
middle
class
squeeze
corporate
culture
rife
with
inside
dealing
questionable
accounting
practices
and
greed
washington
dominated
by
lobbyists
and
special
interests
economic
policies
that
the
few
over
the
many
and
yet
to
wish
away
the
resentments
of
white
americans
to
label
them
as
misguided
or
even
racist
without
they
are
grounded
in
legitimate
concerns
this
too
widens
the
racial
divide
and
blocks
the
path
to
understanding
this
is
where
we
are
right
now
it
racial
stalemate
we
been
stuck
in
for
years
and
contrary
to
the
claims
of
some
of
my
critics
black
and
white
have
never
been
so
naive
as
to
believe
that
we
can
get
beyond
our
racial
divisions
in
single
election
cycle
or
with
single
candidate
particularly
particularly
candidacy
as
imperfect
as
my
own
but
have
asserted
firm
conviction
conviction
rooted
in
my
faith
in
god
and
my
faith
in
the
american
people
that
working
together
we
can
move
beyond
some
of
our
old
racial
wounds
and
that
in
fact
we
have
no
choice
we
have
no
choice
if
we
are
to
continue
on
the
path
of
more
perfect
union
for
the
community
that
path
means
embracing
the
burdens
of
our
past
without
becoming
victims
of
our
past
it
means
continuing
to
insist
on
full
measure
of
justice
in
every
aspect
of
american
life
but
it
also
means
binding
our
particular
grievances
for
better
health
care
and
better
schools
and
better
jobs
to
the
larger
aspirations
of
all
americans
the
white
woman
struggling
to
break
the
glass
ceiling
the
white
man
who
been
laid
off
the
immigrant
trying
to
feed
his
family
and
it
means
also
taking
full
responsibility
for
our
own
lives
by
demanding
more
from
our
fathers
and
spending
more
time
with
our
children
and
reading
to
them
and
teaching
them
that
while
they
may
face
challenges
and
discrimination
in
their
own
lives
they
must
never
succumb
to
despair
or
cynicism
they
must
always
believe
they
must
always
believe
that
they
can
write
their
own
destiny
ironically
this
quintessentially
american
and
yes
conservative
notion
of
found
frequent
expression
in
reverend
wright
sermons
but
what
my
former
pastor
too
often
failed
to
understand
is
that
embarking
on
program
of
also
requires
belief
that
society
can
change
the
profound
mistake
of
reverend
wright
sermons
is
not
that
he
spoke
about
racism
in
our
society
it
that
he
spoke
as
if
our
society
was
static
as
if
no
progress
had
been
made
as
if
this
country
country
that
has
made
it
possible
for
one
of
his
own
members
to
run
for
the
highest
office
in
the
land
and
build
coalition
of
white
and
black
latino
asian
rich
poor
young
and
old
is
still
irrevocably
bound
to
tragic
past
what
we
know
what
we
have
seen
is
that
america
can
change
that
is
true
genius
of
this
nation
what
we
have
already
achieved
gives
us
hope
the
audacity
to
hope
for
what
we
can
and
must
achieve
tomorrow
now
in
the
white
community
the
path
to
more
perfect
union
means
acknowledging
that
what
ails
the
community
does
not
just
exist
in
the
minds
of
black
people
that
the
legacy
of
discrimination
and
current
incidents
of
discrimination
while
less
overt
than
in
the
past
that
these
things
are
real
and
must
be
addressed
not
just
with
words
but
with
deeds
by
investing
in
our
schools
and
our
communities
by
enforcing
our
civil
rights
laws
and
ensuring
fairness
in
our
criminal
justice
system
by
providing
this
generation
with
ladders
of
opportunity
that
were
unavailable
for
previous
generations
it
requires
all
americans
to
that
your
dreams
do
not
have
to
come
at
the
expense
of
my
dreams
that
investing
in
the
health
welfare
and
education
of
black
and
brown
and
white
children
will
ultimately
help
all
of
america
prosper
in
the
end
then
what
is
called
for
is
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
what
all
the
world
great
religions
demand
that
we
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
let
us
be
our
brother
keeper
scripture
tells
us
let
us
be
our
sister
keeper
let
us
find
that
common
stake
we
all
have
in
one
another
and
let
our
politics
reflect
that
spirit
as
well
for
we
have
choice
in
this
country
we
can
accept
politics
that
breeds
division
and
conflict
and
cynicism
we
can
tackle
race
only
as
spectacle
as
we
did
in
the
trial
or
in
the
wake
of
tragedy
as
we
did
in
the
aftermath
of
or
as
fodder
for
the
nightly
news
we
can
play
reverend
wright
sermons
on
every
channel
every
day
and
talk
about
them
from
now
until
the
election
and
make
the
only
question
in
this
campaign
whether
or
not
the
american
people
think
that
somehow
believe
or
with
his
most
offensive
words
we
can
pounce
on
some
gaffe
by
supporter
as
evidence
that
she
playing
the
race
card
or
we
can
speculate
on
whether
white
men
will
all
flock
to
john
in
the
general
election
regardless
of
his
policies
we
can
do
that
but
if
we
do
can
tell
you
that
in
the
next
election
we
be
talking
about
some
other
distraction
and
then
another
one
and
then
another
one
and
nothing
will
change
that
is
one
option
or
at
this
moment
in
this
election
we
can
come
together
and
say
not
this
time
this
time
we
want
to
talk
about
the
crumbling
schools
that
are
stealing
the
future
of
black
children
and
white
children
and
asian
children
and
hispanic
children
and
children
this
time
we
want
to
reject
the
cynicism
that
tells
us
that
these
kids
learn
that
those
kids
who
do
look
like
us
are
somebody
else
problem
the
children
of
america
are
not
those
kids
they
are
our
kids
and
we
will
not
let
them
fall
behind
in
economy
not
this
time
this
time
we
want
to
talk
about
how
the
lines
in
the
emergency
room
are
filled
with
whites
and
blacks
and
who
do
not
have
health
care
who
do
have
the
power
on
their
own
to
overcome
the
special
interests
in
washington
but
who
can
take
them
on
if
we
do
it
together
this
time
we
want
to
talk
about
the
shuttered
mills
that
once
provided
decent
life
for
men
and
women
of
every
race
and
the
homes
for
sale
that
once
belonged
to
americans
from
every
religion
every
region
every
walk
of
life
this
time
we
want
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
real
problem
is
not
that
someone
who
does
look
like
you
might
take
your
job
it
that
the
corporation
you
work
for
will
ship
it
overseas
for
nothing
more
than
profit
this
time
this
time
we
want
to
talk
about
the
men
and
women
of
every
and
creed
who
serve
together
and
fight
together
and
bleed
together
under
the
same
proud
flag
we
want
to
talk
about
how
to
bring
them
home
from
war
that
should
never
been
and
should
never
been
waged
and
we
want
to
talk
about
how
we
show
our
patriotism
by
caring
for
them
and
their
families
and
giving
them
the
benefits
that
they
have
earned
would
not
be
running
for
president
if
did
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
this
is
what
the
vast
majority
of
americans
want
for
this
country
this
union
may
never
be
perfect
but
generation
after
generation
has
shown
that
it
can
always
be
perfected
and
today
whenever
find
myself
feeling
doubtful
or
cynical
about
this
possibility
what
gives
me
the
most
hope
is
the
next
generation
the
young
people
whose
attitudes
and
beliefs
and
openness
to
change
have
already
made
history
in
this
election
there
one
story
in
particular
that
like
to
leave
you
with
today
story
told
when
had
the
great
of
speaking
on
king
birthday
at
his
home
church
baptist
in
atlanta
there
young
woman
white
woman
named
who
for
our
campaign
in
florence
south
she
been
working
to
mostly
community
since
the
beginning
of
this
campaign
and
one
day
she
was
at
discussion
where
everyone
went
around
telling
their
story
and
why
they
were
there
and
said
that
when
she
was
years
old
her
mother
got
cancer
and
because
she
had
to
miss
days
of
work
she
was
let
go
and
lost
her
health
care
they
had
to
file
for
bankruptcy
and
that
when
decided
that
she
had
to
do
something
to
help
her
mom
she
knew
that
food
was
one
of
their
most
expensive
costs
and
so
convinced
her
mother
that
what
she
really
liked
and
really
wanted
to
eat
more
than
anything
else
was
mustard
and
relish
sandwiches
because
that
was
the
cheapest
way
to
eat
that
the
mind
of
year
old
she
did
this
for
year
until
her
mom
got
better
and
so
told
everyone
at
the
that
the
reason
she
had
joined
our
campaign
was
so
that
she
could
help
the
millions
of
other
children
in
the
country
who
want
and
need
to
help
their
parents
too
now
might
have
made
different
choice
perhaps
somebody
told
her
along
the
way
that
the
source
of
her
mother
problems
were
blacks
who
were
on
welfare
and
too
lazy
to
work
or
who
were
coming
into
the
country
illegally
but
she
did
she
sought
out
allies
in
her
fight
against
injustice
anyway
finishes
her
story
and
then
goes
around
the
room
and
asks
everyone
else
why
they
supporting
the
campaign
they
all
have
different
stories
and
different
reasons
many
bring
up
specific
issue
and
finally
they
come
to
this
elderly
black
man
who
been
sitting
there
quietly
the
entire
time
and
asks
him
why
he
there
and
he
does
bring
up
specific
issue
he
does
not
say
health
care
or
the
economy
he
does
not
say
education
or
the
war
he
does
not
say
that
he
was
there
because
of
he
simply
says
to
everyone
in
the
room
am
here
because
of
here
because
of
now
by
itself
that
single
moment
of
recognition
between
that
young
white
girl
and
that
old
black
man
is
not
enough
it
is
not
enough
to
give
health
care
to
the
sick
or
jobs
to
the
jobless
or
education
to
our
children
but
it
is
where
we
start
it
is
where
our
union
grows
stronger
and
as
so
many
generations
have
come
to
over
the
course
of
the
years
since
band
of
patriots
signed
that
document
right
here
in
that
is
where
perfection
begins
thank
you
very
much
everyone
thank
you
thank
you
south
thank
you
to
the
rock
of
my
life
thank
you
to
and
who
have
seen
their
daddy
in
week
thank
you
to
for
his
outstanding
service
to
our
country
and
being
such
great
supporter
of
this
campaign
you
know
over
two
weeks
ago
we
saw
the
people
of
proclaim
that
our
time
for
change
has
come
but
there
were
those
who
doubted
this
country
desire
for
something
new
who
said
was
fluke
not
to
be
repeated
again
well
tonight
the
cynics
who
believed
that
what
began
in
the
snows
of
was
just
an
illusion
were
told
different
story
by
the
good
people
of
south
after
four
great
contests
in
every
corner
of
this
country
we
have
the
most
votes
the
most
delegates
and
the
most
diverse
coalition
of
americans
that
we
seen
in
long
long
time
you
can
see
it
in
the
faces
here
tonight
there
are
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
they
are
black
and
white
latino
and
asian
and
native
american
they
are
democrats
from
and
independents
from
concord
and
yes
some
republicans
from
rural
and
we
got
young
people
all
across
this
country
who
never
had
reason
to
participate
until
now
and
in
nine
days
in
nine
short
days
nearly
half
the
nation
will
have
the
chance
to
join
us
in
saying
that
we
are
tired
of
business
as
usual
in
washington
we
are
hungry
for
change
and
we
are
ready
to
believe
again
but
if
there
anything
though
that
we
been
reminded
of
since
it
that
the
kind
of
change
we
seek
will
not
come
easy
now
partly
because
we
have
fine
candidates
in
this
field
fierce
competitors
who
are
worthy
of
our
respect
and
our
admiration
and
as
contentious
as
this
campaign
may
get
we
have
to
remember
that
this
is
contest
for
the
democratic
nomination
and
that
all
of
us
share
an
abiding
desire
to
end
the
disastrous
policies
of
the
current
administration
but
there
are
real
differences
between
the
candidates
we
are
looking
for
more
than
just
change
of
party
in
the
white
house
we
looking
to
fundamentally
change
the
status
in
washington
it
status
that
extends
beyond
any
particular
party
and
right
now
that
status
is
fighting
back
with
everything
it
got
with
the
same
old
tactics
that
divide
and
distract
us
from
solving
the
problems
people
face
whether
those
problems
are
health
care
that
folks
afford
or
mortgage
they
can
not
pay
so
this
will
not
be
easy
make
no
mistake
about
what
we
up
against
we
up
against
the
belief
that
it
all
right
for
lobbyists
to
dominate
our
government
that
they
are
just
part
of
the
system
in
washington
but
we
know
that
the
undue
influence
of
lobbyists
is
part
of
the
problem
and
this
election
is
our
chance
to
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
let
them
stand
in
our
way
anymore
we
up
against
the
conventional
thinking
that
says
your
ability
to
lead
as
president
comes
from
longevity
in
washington
or
proximity
to
the
white
house
but
we
know
that
real
leadership
is
about
and
judgment
and
the
ability
to
rally
americans
from
all
walks
of
life
around
common
purpose
higher
purpose
we
up
against
decades
of
bitter
partisanship
that
cause
politicians
to
their
opponents
instead
of
coming
together
to
make
college
affordable
or
energy
cleaner
it
the
kind
of
partisanship
where
you
not
even
allowed
to
say
that
republican
had
an
idea
even
if
it
one
you
never
agreed
with
that
the
kind
of
politics
that
is
bad
for
our
party
it
is
bad
for
our
country
and
this
is
our
chance
to
end
it
once
and
for
all
we
up
against
the
idea
that
it
acceptable
to
say
anything
and
do
anything
to
win
an
election
but
we
know
that
this
is
exactly
what
wrong
with
our
politics
this
is
why
people
do
believe
what
their
leaders
say
anymore
this
is
why
they
tune
out
and
this
election
is
our
chance
to
give
the
american
people
reason
to
believe
again
but
let
me
say
this
south
what
we
seen
in
these
last
weeks
is
that
we
also
up
against
forces
that
are
not
the
fault
of
any
one
campaign
but
feed
the
habits
that
prevent
us
from
being
who
we
want
to
be
as
nation
it
politics
that
uses
religion
as
wedge
and
patriotism
as
bludgeon
politics
that
tells
us
that
we
have
to
think
act
and
even
vote
within
the
confines
of
the
categories
that
supposedly
define
us
the
assumption
that
young
people
are
apathetic
the
assumption
that
republicans
cross
over
the
assumption
that
the
wealthy
care
nothing
for
the
poor
and
that
the
poor
do
vote
the
assumption
that
support
the
white
candidate
whites
support
the
candidate
blacks
and
can
not
come
together
we
are
here
tonight
to
say
that
that
is
not
the
america
we
believe
in
did
not
travel
around
this
state
over
the
last
year
and
see
white
south
or
black
south
saw
south
because
in
the
end
we
not
up
just
against
the
ingrained
and
destructive
habits
of
washington
we
also
struggling
with
our
own
doubts
our
own
fears
our
own
cynicism
the
change
we
seek
has
always
required
great
struggle
and
great
sacrifice
and
so
this
is
battle
in
our
own
hearts
and
minds
about
what
kind
of
country
we
want
and
how
hard
we
willing
to
work
for
it
so
let
me
remind
you
tonight
that
change
will
not
be
easy
change
will
take
time
there
will
be
setbacks
and
false
starts
and
sometimes
we
make
mistakes
but
as
hard
as
it
may
seem
we
can
not
lose
hope
because
there
are
people
all
across
this
great
nation
who
are
counting
on
us
who
afford
another
four
years
without
health
care
they
afford
another
four
years
without
good
schools
they
afford
another
four
years
without
decent
wages
because
our
leaders
could
come
together
and
get
it
done
theirs
are
the
stories
and
voices
we
carry
on
from
south
the
mother
who
get
to
cover
all
the
needs
of
her
sick
child
she
needs
us
to
pass
health
care
plan
that
cuts
costs
and
makes
health
care
available
and
affordable
for
every
single
american
that
what
she
looking
for
the
teacher
who
works
another
shift
at
after
school
just
to
make
ends
meet
she
needs
us
to
reform
our
education
system
so
that
she
gets
better
pay
and
more
support
and
that
students
get
the
resources
that
they
need
to
achieve
their
dreams
the
worker
who
now
competing
with
his
own
teenager
for
job
at
the
local
because
the
factory
he
gave
his
life
to
shut
its
doors
he
needs
us
to
stop
giving
tax
breaks
to
companies
that
ship
our
jobs
overseas
and
start
putting
them
in
the
pockets
of
working
americans
who
deserve
it
and
put
them
in
the
pockets
of
struggling
homeowners
who
are
having
tough
time
and
looking
after
seniors
who
should
retire
with
dignity
and
respect
that
woman
who
told
me
that
she
has
been
able
to
breathe
since
the
day
her
nephew
left
for
iraq
or
the
soldier
who
does
know
his
child
because
he
on
his
third
or
fourth
or
even
fifth
tour
of
duty
they
need
us
to
come
together
and
put
an
end
to
war
that
should
have
never
been
and
should
have
never
been
waged
so
understand
this
south
the
choice
in
this
election
is
not
between
regions
or
religions
or
genders
it
not
about
rich
versus
poor
young
versus
old
and
it
is
not
about
black
versus
white
this
election
is
about
the
past
versus
the
future
it
about
whether
we
settle
for
the
same
divisions
and
distractions
and
drama
that
passes
for
politics
today
or
whether
we
reach
for
politics
of
common
sense
and
innovation
politics
of
shared
sacrifice
and
shared
prosperity
there
are
those
who
will
continue
to
tell
us
that
we
do
this
that
we
have
what
we
looking
for
that
we
have
what
we
want
that
we
peddling
false
hopes
but
here
what
know
know
that
when
people
say
we
overcome
all
the
big
money
and
influence
in
washington
think
of
that
elderly
woman
who
sent
me
contribution
the
other
day
an
envelope
that
had
money
order
for
along
with
verse
of
scripture
tucked
inside
the
envelope
so
do
tell
us
change
is
possible
that
woman
knows
change
is
possible
when
hear
the
cynical
talk
that
blacks
and
whites
and
join
together
and
work
together
reminded
of
the
latino
brothers
and
sisters
with
and
stood
with
and
fought
with
side
by
side
for
jobs
and
justice
on
the
streets
of
chicago
so
do
tell
us
change
happen
when
hear
that
we
never
overcome
the
racial
divide
in
our
politics
think
about
that
republican
woman
who
used
to
work
for
who
now
devoted
to
educating
children
and
who
went
out
into
the
streets
of
south
and
knocked
on
doors
for
this
campaign
do
tell
me
we
change
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
change
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
heal
this
nation
yes
we
can
seize
our
future
and
as
we
leave
this
great
state
with
new
wind
at
our
backs
and
we
take
this
journey
across
this
great
country
country
we
love
with
the
message
we
carried
from
the
plains
of
to
the
hills
of
new
from
the
desert
to
the
south
coast
the
same
message
we
had
when
we
were
up
and
when
we
were
down
that
out
of
many
we
are
one
that
while
we
breathe
we
will
hope
and
where
we
are
met
with
cynicism
and
doubt
and
fear
and
those
who
tell
us
that
we
we
will
respond
with
that
timeless
creed
that
sums
up
the
spirit
of
the
american
people
in
three
simple
words
yes
we
can
thank
you
south
love
you
scripture
tells
us
that
when
joshua
and
the
arrived
at
the
gates
of
jericho
they
could
not
enter
the
walls
of
the
city
were
too
steep
for
any
one
person
to
climb
they
were
too
strong
to
be
taken
down
by
brute
force
and
so
the
people
sat
for
days
unable
to
pass
on
through
but
god
had
plan
for
his
people
he
told
them
to
stand
together
and
march
together
around
the
city
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
told
them
that
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
horn
they
should
speak
with
one
voice
and
at
the
chosen
hour
when
the
horn
sounded
and
chorus
of
voices
cried
out
together
the
mighty
walls
of
jericho
came
tumbling
down
what
scripture
tells
us
and
there
are
many
lessons
to
take
from
this
passage
just
as
there
are
many
lessons
to
take
from
this
day
just
as
there
are
many
memories
that
fill
the
space
of
this
church
as
was
thinking
about
which
ones
we
needed
to
remember
at
this
hour
my
mind
went
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
modern
civil
rights
era
because
before
memphis
and
the
before
the
bridge
in
and
the
march
on
washington
before
and
the
beatings
the
fire
hoses
and
the
loss
of
those
four
little
girls
before
there
was
king
the
icon
and
his
magnificent
dream
there
was
king
the
young
preacher
and
people
who
found
themselves
suffering
under
the
yolk
of
oppression
and
on
the
eve
of
the
bus
boycotts
in
at
time
when
many
were
still
doubtful
about
the
possibilities
of
change
time
when
there
were
those
in
the
black
community
who
not
only
mistrusted
each
other
but
mistrusted
themselves
king
inspired
with
words
not
of
anger
but
of
an
urgency
fierce
urgency
that
still
speaks
to
us
today
he
said
the
great
need
of
the
is
the
great
need
of
the
unity
is
how
we
shall
overcome
what
king
understood
is
that
if
just
one
person
chose
to
walk
instead
of
the
bus
those
walls
of
oppression
would
not
be
moved
but
maybe
if
few
more
decided
to
walk
those
foundations
might
start
to
shake
if
just
few
women
were
willing
to
do
what
parks
had
been
willing
to
do
maybe
the
cracks
in
those
walls
would
start
to
show
if
teenagers
took
rides
from
north
to
south
maybe
few
bricks
would
come
loose
maybe
if
white
folks
marched
because
come
to
understand
that
their
freedom
was
wrapped
up
in
the
freedom
of
others
that
they
too
had
stake
in
the
impending
battle
the
walls
would
begin
to
sway
and
if
enough
americans
were
awakened
to
injustice
if
they
joined
together
north
and
south
rich
and
poor
jew
and
gentile
then
perhaps
that
wall
would
come
tumbling
down
and
justice
would
flow
like
waters
of
righteousness
like
mighty
stream
is
the
great
need
of
the
what
king
said
it
is
the
great
need
of
this
hour
as
well
not
because
it
sounds
pleasant
not
because
it
makes
us
feel
good
but
because
it
the
only
way
we
can
overcome
the
essential
deficit
that
exits
in
this
country
not
talking
about
the
budget
deficit
not
talking
about
the
trade
deficit
talking
about
the
moral
deficit
in
this
country
talking
about
an
empathy
deficit
the
inability
to
ourselves
in
one
another
to
understand
that
we
are
our
keeper
and
our
keeper
that
in
the
words
of
king
are
all
tied
together
in
single
garment
of
we
have
an
empathy
deficit
when
still
sending
our
children
down
corridors
of
shame
schools
in
the
forgotten
corners
of
america
where
the
of
your
skin
still
affects
the
content
of
your
education
we
have
deficit
when
are
making
more
in
ten
minutes
than
ordinary
workers
are
making
in
an
entire
year
when
families
lose
their
homes
so
unscrupulous
lenders
can
make
profit
when
mothers
afford
doctor
when
their
children
are
stricken
with
illness
we
have
deficit
in
this
country
when
we
have
scooter
justice
for
some
and
justice
for
others
when
our
children
see
hanging
nooses
from
school
yard
tree
today
in
the
present
in
the
century
we
have
deficit
when
homeless
veterans
sleep
on
the
streets
of
our
cities
when
innocents
are
slaughtered
in
the
deserts
of
when
young
americans
serve
tour
after
tour
after
tour
after
tour
of
duty
in
war
that
should
have
never
been
and
should
have
never
been
waged
we
have
an
empathy
deficit
in
this
country
that
has
to
be
closed
we
have
deficit
when
it
takes
breach
in
the
to
reveal
the
breach
in
our
compassion
when
it
takes
terrible
storm
to
reveal
the
hungry
that
god
calls
on
us
to
feed
the
sick
that
he
calls
on
us
to
care
for
the
least
of
these
that
he
commands
that
we
treat
as
our
own
so
we
have
deficit
to
close
we
have
walls
barriers
to
justice
and
equality
that
must
come
down
and
to
do
this
we
know
that
is
the
great
need
of
the
however
all
too
often
when
we
talk
about
unity
in
this
country
come
to
believe
that
it
can
be
purchased
on
the
cheap
come
to
believe
that
racial
reconciliation
can
come
easily
that
just
matter
of
few
ignorant
people
trapped
in
the
prejudices
of
the
past
and
that
if
the
demagogues
and
those
who
would
exploit
our
racial
divisions
will
simply
go
away
then
all
our
problems
will
be
solved
all
too
often
we
seek
to
ignore
the
profound
structural
and
institutional
barriers
that
stand
in
the
way
of
insuring
opportunity
for
all
of
our
children
or
decent
jobs
for
all
of
our
people
or
health
care
for
those
who
are
sick
we
offer
unity
but
we
are
not
willing
to
pay
the
price
that
required
of
course
true
unity
can
not
be
so
easily
purchased
it
starts
with
change
in
attitudes
it
starts
with
changing
our
hearts
and
changing
our
minds
broadening
our
spirit
not
easy
to
stand
in
somebody
shoes
not
easy
to
see
past
our
own
differences
all
encountered
this
in
our
own
lives
what
makes
it
even
more
difficult
is
that
we
have
politics
in
this
country
that
seeks
to
drive
us
apart
that
puts
up
walls
between
us
we
are
told
that
those
who
differ
from
us
on
few
things
differ
from
us
on
all
things
that
our
problems
are
the
fault
of
those
who
think
like
us
or
look
like
us
or
come
from
where
we
do
the
welfare
queen
taking
our
money
the
immigrant
taking
our
jobs
the
believer
condemns
the
nonbeliever
as
immoral
and
the
nonbeliever
chides
the
believer
for
being
intolerant
and
for
most
of
this
history
we
in
the
community
have
been
at
the
receiving
end
of
inhumanity
to
man
and
all
of
us
understand
insidious
all
of
us
understand
intimately
the
insidious
role
that
race
still
sometimes
plays
on
the
job
and
in
the
schools
in
our
health
care
system
and
in
our
criminal
justice
system
and
yet
if
we
are
honest
with
ourselves
we
must
admit
that
none
of
our
hands
are
entirely
clean
if
honest
with
ourselves
we
acknowledge
that
our
own
community
has
not
always
been
true
to
vision
of
beloved
community
if
honest
with
ourselves
we
have
to
admit
that
there
have
been
times
when
we
scorned
our
gay
brothers
and
sisters
instead
of
embracing
them
the
scourge
of
has
at
times
revealed
itself
in
our
community
for
too
long
some
of
us
have
seen
immigrants
only
as
competitors
for
jobs
instead
of
companions
in
the
fight
for
opportunity
everyday
our
politics
fuels
and
exploits
this
kind
of
division
across
all
races
and
regions
across
gender
and
party
it
is
played
out
on
television
it
is
by
the
media
last
week
it
crept
into
the
campaign
for
president
with
charges
and
that
serve
to
obscure
the
issues
instead
of
illuminating
the
critical
choices
we
face
as
nation
none
of
our
hands
are
clean
so
let
us
say
that
on
this
day
of
all
days
each
of
us
carries
with
us
the
task
of
changing
our
hearts
and
minds
the
divisions
the
stereotypes
the
the
ease
with
which
we
blame
the
plight
of
ourselves
on
others
all
of
that
distracts
us
from
the
common
challenges
that
we
face
war
and
poverty
inequality
and
injustice
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
build
ourselves
up
by
tearing
each
other
down
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
traffic
in
lies
or
fear
or
hate
it
the
poison
that
we
must
purge
from
our
politics
the
wall
that
we
must
tear
down
before
the
hour
grows
too
late
because
if
king
could
love
his
jailer
if
he
could
call
on
the
faithful
who
once
sat
where
you
do
to
forgive
those
who
had
set
dogs
and
fire
hoses
upon
them
then
surely
we
can
look
past
what
divides
us
in
our
time
and
bind
up
our
wounds
and
erase
the
sympathy
deficit
that
exists
in
our
hearts
but
if
changing
our
hearts
and
our
minds
is
the
first
critical
step
we
can
not
stop
there
not
enough
to
bemoan
the
plight
of
the
poor
in
this
country
and
remain
unwilling
to
push
our
elected
officials
to
provide
the
resources
to
fix
our
schools
it
not
enough
to
decry
the
disparities
of
health
care
and
yet
allow
the
insurance
companies
and
the
drug
companies
to
block
real
reform
in
our
health
care
system
not
enough
not
enough
for
us
to
abhor
the
costs
of
misguided
war
and
yet
we
continue
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
driven
by
politics
of
fear
that
sees
the
threat
of
an
attack
as
way
to
scare
up
votes
instead
of
call
to
come
together
in
common
effort
scripture
tells
us
that
we
are
judged
not
just
by
word
but
by
deed
and
if
we
are
truly
to
bring
about
the
unity
that
is
needed
that
is
so
crucial
in
this
time
we
have
to
find
it
within
ourselves
to
act
on
what
we
know
to
understand
that
living
up
to
this
ideals
and
its
possibilities
is
going
to
require
great
effort
and
great
resources
sacrifice
and
stamina
we
pass
law
called
no
child
left
behind
and
then
leave
the
money
behind
that
is
not
serious
effort
in
bringing
about
the
unity
that
is
needed
we
celebrate
dream
and
yet
still
have
insufficient
funds
to
cash
that
promissory
note
that
was
promised
at
the
beginning
of
this
nation
that
is
what
is
at
stake
in
this
great
debate
we
are
having
today
changes
that
are
needed
are
not
just
matter
of
tinkering
around
the
edges
they
will
not
come
if
politicians
simply
tell
us
what
we
want
to
hear
all
of
us
will
be
called
upon
to
make
some
sacrifice
none
of
us
will
be
exempt
from
responsibility
we
had
to
fight
to
fix
our
schools
but
we
also
have
to
challenge
ourselves
to
be
better
parents
and
turn
off
the
television
set
and
put
away
the
video
game
and
our
men
have
to
be
home
with
our
children
that
too
is
part
of
the
challenge
that
we
must
make
we
will
have
to
confront
the
biases
in
our
criminal
justice
system
but
we
also
have
to
acknowledge
the
violence
that
still
resides
in
our
own
communities
in
too
many
of
the
hearts
of
our
young
people
and
we
have
to
break
the
grip
of
that
violence
wherever
we
see
it
how
going
to
bring
about
the
change
that
we
seek
how
king
led
this
country
through
the
wilderness
he
did
it
with
words
words
that
he
spoke
not
just
to
the
children
of
slaves
but
the
children
of
slave
owners
words
that
inspired
not
just
black
but
also
white
not
just
christian
but
also
jew
and
muslim
and
and
atheists
not
just
the
southerner
but
also
the
northerner
he
led
with
words
but
he
also
led
with
deeds
he
also
led
by
example
he
led
by
marching
and
going
to
jail
and
suffering
threats
and
beatings
and
being
away
from
his
family
he
led
by
taking
stand
against
war
knowing
full
well
that
it
would
diminish
his
popularity
he
led
by
challenging
our
economic
structures
understanding
that
it
would
cause
discomfort
king
understood
that
unity
can
not
be
won
on
the
cheap
that
we
would
have
to
earn
it
through
great
effort
and
determination
the
unity
the
hard
earned
unity
that
we
need
right
now
that
is
the
effort
the
determination
that
can
transform
blind
optimism
into
hope
you
know
people
have
remarked
on
the
fact
that
talk
about
hope
lot
in
my
campaign
you
know
they
they
tease
me
little
bit
some
have
been
scornful
they
say
talking
about
hope
again
so
idealistic
so
hope
okay
true
talk
about
hope
talk
about
it
lot
because
the
odds
of
me
standing
here
today
are
so
small
so
remote
that
of
gotten
here
without
some
hope
you
know
my
my
daddy
left
me
when
was
two
years
old
needed
some
hope
to
get
here
was
raised
by
single
mother
needed
some
hope
to
get
here
got
in
trouble
when
was
teenager
did
some
things
folks
now
like
to
talk
about
needed
some
hope
to
get
here
born
into
money
or
great
wealth
or
great
privilege
or
status
was
given
love
an
education
and
some
hope
what
got
my
birthright
so
talk
about
hope
put
on
my
campaign
signs
it
even
have
my
name
on
them
sometimes
just
says
folks
know
who
voting
for
but
it
makes
them
feel
good
say
you
know
huh
spoke
about
hope
at
the
democratic
convention
wrote
book
called
the
audacity
of
hope
and
so
so
puzzled
when
when
some
people
some
of
the
other
candidates
make
mockery
of
the
idea
they
say
false
hopes
get
reality
check
they
tell
me
and
have
to
have
to
try
to
understand
what
they
saying
the
implication
is
is
that
if
you
are
hopeful
that
you
somehow
must
be
engaging
in
wishful
thinking
your
your
head
must
be
in
the
clouds
that
you
must
be
passive
and
just
sit
back
and
wait
for
things
to
happen
to
you
that
seems
to
be
the
implication
and
so
have
to
explain
to
people
not
what
hope
is
hope
is
not
blind
optimism
hope
is
not
ignorance
of
the
barriers
and
hurdles
and
hazards
that
stand
in
your
way
just
the
opposite
know
how
hard
it
will
be
to
provide
health
care
to
every
single
american
the
insurance
companies
drug
companies
they
want
to
give
up
their
profits
know
it
be
easy
to
have
energy
policy
that
makes
sense
for
america
because
the
oil
companies
like
writing
the
energy
bills
know
that
alleviating
poverty
or
making
sure
all
our
children
can
learn
or
eliminating
the
scourge
of
racism
in
our
society
none
of
those
things
lend
themselves
to
simple
solutions
know
because
fought
on
the
streets
as
community
in
poor
on
the
of
chicago
alongside
those
without
jobs
or
without
prospects
for
the
future
have
fought
in
the
courts
as
civil
rights
attorney
for
those
who
had
been
denied
opportunity
on
the
job
or
denied
access
to
the
ballot
box
seen
good
legislation
die
because
well
seen
that
too
seen
good
legislation
die
because
good
intentions
enough
because
they
fortified
with
political
majority
and
political
will
seen
this
country
this
judgment
clouded
by
fear
know
how
easily
country
can
be
misled
when
it
is
afraid
know
how
hard
it
is
everybody
here
understands
how
difficult
it
is
to
bring
about
true
change
change
that
we
can
believe
in
but
also
know
this
that
nothing
in
this
country
worthwhile
has
ever
happened
except
somebody
somewhere
decided
to
hope
how
this
country
was
founded
because
group
of
patriots
decided
they
were
going
to
take
on
the
british
empire
nobody
was
putting
their
money
on
them
how
slaves
and
abolitionists
resisted
that
evil
system
how
new
president
was
able
to
chart
course
to
insure
that
this
nation
would
no
longer
remain
half
slave
and
half
free
how
the
greatest
generation
defeated
fascism
and
overcame
great
depression
how
women
won
the
right
to
vote
how
workers
won
the
right
to
how
young
people
and
old
people
and
folks
were
willing
to
walk
instead
of
ride
the
bus
and
folks
came
down
on
freedom
rides
they
marched
and
they
sat
in
and
they
were
beaten
and
fire
houses
were
sent
on
them
and
dogs
were
sent
on
them
and
some
went
to
jail
and
some
died
for
freedom
cause
what
hope
is
imagining
and
then
fighting
for
and
struggling
for
and
sometimes
dying
for
what
seem
possible
before
nothing
about
that
there
are
no
false
hopes
in
that
believe
in
false
hopes
imagine
if
john
kennedy
had
looked
up
at
the
moon
and
said
well
too
far
false
hopes
we
go
there
if
king
had
stood
on
the
lincoln
memorial
and
said
go
home
we
overcome
no
such
thing
as
false
hopes
but
what
know
deep
in
my
heart
is
that
we
can
not
bring
about
change
unless
we
are
unified
unless
we
do
it
together
change
does
not
happen
from
the
top
down
in
america
or
anywhere
else
it
happens
from
the
bottom
up
it
happens
because
ordinary
people
dream
extraordinary
things
because
all
of
you
decide
that
change
must
come
that
know
it
just
one
voice
it
was
just
one
voice
that
shouted
out
before
the
walls
of
jericho
all
the
voices
came
together
chorus
of
voices
what
gives
me
hope
not
just
those
who
ascend
to
high
office
but
the
changes
that
are
happening
in
ordinary
places
the
stories
that
give
me
my
hope
happen
in
the
spotlight
when
think
about
king
suspect
he
was
sustained
not
by
having
dinner
with
presidents
not
by
getting
the
peace
prize
but
coming
back
to
church
and
seeing
the
mothers
of
the
church
and
the
deacons
those
who
maintained
their
dignity
were
standing
up
straight
in
the
face
of
injustice
where
he
drew
his
hope
he
saw
god
in
their
faces
those
stories
happen
on
presidential
stage
they
happen
in
the
quiet
quarters
of
our
lives
they
happen
in
the
moments
we
least
expect
so
let
me
close
by
giving
an
example
of
one
of
those
stories
there
is
young
woman
years
old
white
woman
named
who
for
our
campaign
in
florence
south
has
been
working
to
mostly
black
folks
in
florence
south
been
doing
it
since
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
and
the
other
day
she
set
up
round
table
discussion
where
everyone
around
was
telling
their
story
about
who
they
were
and
why
they
were
there
and
so
explained
she
started
things
off
by
explaining
why
she
was
there
and
she
explained
that
when
she
was
nine
years
old
her
mother
got
cancer
and
because
she
had
to
miss
day
of
work
she
was
let
go
and
she
lost
her
health
care
and
then
she
had
to
file
for
bankruptcy
they
were
on
hard
times
and
when
at
the
time
decided
she
had
to
do
something
to
help
her
mom
and
she
knew
that
food
was
one
of
their
most
expensive
costs
they
have
lot
of
money
lived
in
poor
household
and
so
convinced
her
mother
that
she
really
liked
and
really
wanted
to
eat
more
than
anything
else
mustard
and
relish
sandwiches
she
had
heard
that
condiments
like
mustard
and
relish
were
cheap
and
she
she
concocted
in
her
own
mind
at
the
age
of
nine
that
she
would
convince
her
mother
that
the
only
thing
she
wanted
to
eat
everyday
because
she
figured
that
would
be
way
of
saving
money
for
the
family
and
helping
them
alleviate
their
hardships
so
she
did
this
for
year
until
her
mom
got
better
and
in
that
round
table
she
told
everyone
that
the
reason
she
joined
our
campaign
was
so
that
she
could
help
millions
of
other
children
in
the
country
who
want
and
need
to
help
their
parents
too
she
had
heard
me
speak
about
my
mother
having
cancer
and
having
to
worry
about
maybe
not
getting
the
health
care
she
needed
because
of
condition
and
she
had
connected
with
that
she
thought
maybe
would
fight
for
my
mother
and
if
he
would
fight
for
my
mother
then
maybe
will
fight
alongside
him
what
had
brought
her
to
florence
so
finishes
her
story
and
then
goes
around
the
room
and
asks
everyone
else
why
supporting
the
campaign
they
all
have
different
stories
and
different
reasons
some
bring
up
specific
issues
some
talk
about
upset
about
affirmative
action
some
talk
about
you
know
want
to
see
more
jobs
in
the
community
some
are
frustrated
about
trade
some
just
like
me
so
they
all
got
bunch
of
different
reasons
and
finally
at
the
end
of
this
discussion
they
come
to
this
elderly
black
man
been
sitting
there
quiet
the
whole
time
been
saying
word
and
asks
him
why
is
he
there
and
he
bring
up
specific
issue
he
does
not
say
or
the
economy
he
talk
about
the
iraq
war
he
say
anything
about
education
he
say
that
there
because
he
likes
or
proud
of
the
possibility
of
the
first
african
american
president
he
simply
says
to
everyone
in
the
room
am
here
because
of
am
here
because
of
this
young
girl
and
the
fact
that
she
willing
to
fight
for
what
she
believes
in
and
that
reminds
me
that
still
have
some
fight
left
in
me
and
going
stand
up
for
what
believe
now
by
itself
that
single
moment
of
recognition
between
that
young
white
girl
and
that
old
black
man
not
enough
to
change
country
by
itself
not
enough
to
give
health
care
to
the
sick
or
jobs
to
the
jobless
or
education
to
our
children
but
it
is
where
we
begin
why
believe
that
the
walls
in
that
room
began
to
shake
at
that
moment
and
if
they
can
shake
in
that
room
then
they
can
shake
here
in
atlanta
and
if
they
can
shake
in
atlanta
then
they
can
shake
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
if
they
can
shake
in
georgia
they
can
shake
all
across
america
and
if
enough
of
our
voices
join
together
if
we
see
each
other
in
each
eyes
we
can
bring
those
walls
tumbling
down
the
walls
of
jericho
can
finally
come
tumbling
down
that
is
our
hope
but
only
if
we
pray
together
if
we
work
together
and
if
we
march
together
we
can
not
walk
alone
brothers
and
sisters
we
can
not
walk
alone
in
the
struggle
for
justice
and
for
equality
we
can
not
walk
alone
in
the
struggle
for
opportunity
and
justice
we
can
not
walk
alone
in
the
struggle
to
heal
this
nation
and
repair
the
world
we
can
not
walk
alone
so
ask
you
to
walk
with
me
and
march
with
me
and
join
your
voices
with
mine
and
together
we
will
sing
the
song
that
tears
down
the
walls
that
divide
us
and
lift
up
an
america
that
is
truly
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
the
great
pastor
of
this
church
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
new
love
you
back
thank
you
thank
you
well
thank
you
so
much
am
still
fired
up
and
ready
to
go
thank
you
thank
you
well
first
of
all
want
to
congratulate
senator
on
victory
here
in
new
she
did
an
outstanding
job
give
her
big
round
of
applause
you
know
few
weeks
ago
no
one
imagined
that
we
have
accomplished
what
we
did
here
tonight
in
new
no
one
could
have
imagined
it
for
most
of
this
campaign
we
were
far
behind
we
always
knew
our
climb
would
be
steep
but
in
record
numbers
you
came
out
and
you
spoke
up
for
change
and
with
your
voices
and
your
votes
you
made
it
clear
that
at
this
moment
in
this
election
there
is
something
happening
in
america
there
is
something
happening
when
men
and
women
in
and
in
lebanon
and
concord
come
out
in
the
snows
of
january
to
wait
in
lines
that
stretch
block
after
block
because
they
believe
in
what
this
country
can
be
there
is
something
happening
there
something
happening
when
americans
who
are
young
in
age
and
in
spirit
who
never
participated
in
politics
before
turn
out
in
numbers
we
have
never
seen
because
they
know
in
their
hearts
that
this
time
must
be
different
there
something
happening
when
people
vote
not
just
for
party
that
they
belong
to
but
the
hopes
that
they
hold
in
common
and
whether
we
are
rich
or
poor
black
or
white
latino
or
asian
whether
we
hail
from
or
new
or
south
we
are
ready
to
take
this
country
in
fundamentally
new
direction
that
what
happening
in
america
right
now
change
is
what
happening
in
america
you
all
of
you
who
are
here
tonight
all
who
put
so
much
heart
and
soul
and
work
into
this
campaign
you
can
be
the
new
majority
who
can
lead
this
nation
out
of
long
political
darkness
democrats
independents
and
republicans
who
are
tired
of
the
division
and
distraction
that
has
clouded
washington
who
know
that
we
can
disagree
without
being
disagreeable
who
understand
that
if
we
our
voices
to
challenge
the
money
and
influence
that
stood
in
our
way
and
challenge
ourselves
to
reach
for
something
better
there
is
no
problem
we
can
not
solve
there
is
no
destiny
that
we
can
not
our
new
american
majority
can
end
the
outrage
of
unaffordable
unavailable
health
care
in
our
time
we
can
bring
doctors
and
patients
workers
and
businesses
democrats
and
republicans
together
and
we
can
tell
the
drug
and
insurance
industry
that
while
they
get
seat
at
the
table
they
do
get
to
buy
every
chair
not
this
time
not
now
our
new
majority
can
end
the
tax
breaks
for
corporations
that
ship
our
jobs
overseas
and
put
tax
cut
in
the
pockets
of
working
americans
who
deserve
it
we
can
stop
sending
our
children
to
schools
with
corridors
of
shame
and
start
putting
them
on
pathway
to
success
we
can
stop
talking
about
how
great
teachers
are
and
start
rewarding
them
for
their
greatness
by
giving
them
more
pay
and
more
support
we
can
do
this
with
our
new
majority
we
can
harness
the
ingenuity
of
farmers
and
scientists
citizens
and
entrepreneurs
to
free
this
nation
from
the
tyranny
of
oil
and
save
our
planet
from
point
of
no
return
and
when
am
president
of
the
united
states
we
will
end
this
war
in
iraq
and
bring
our
troops
home
we
will
end
this
war
in
iraq
we
will
bring
our
troops
home
we
will
finish
the
job
we
will
finish
the
job
against
in
we
will
care
for
our
veterans
we
will
restore
our
moral
standing
in
the
world
and
we
will
never
use
as
way
to
scare
up
votes
because
it
is
not
tactic
to
win
an
election
it
is
challenge
that
should
unite
america
and
the
world
against
the
common
threats
of
the
century
terrorism
and
nuclear
weapons
climate
change
and
poverty
genocide
and
disease
all
of
the
candidates
in
this
race
share
these
goals
all
of
the
candidates
in
this
race
have
good
ideas
and
all
are
patriots
who
serve
this
country
but
the
reason
our
campaign
has
always
been
different
the
reason
we
began
this
improbable
journey
almost
year
ago
is
because
it
not
just
about
what
will
do
as
president
it
is
also
about
what
you
the
people
who
love
this
country
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america
can
do
to
change
it
that
what
this
election
is
all
about
that
why
tonight
belongs
to
you
it
belongs
to
the
and
the
volunteers
and
the
staff
who
believed
in
this
journey
and
rallied
so
many
others
to
join
the
cause
we
know
the
battle
ahead
will
be
long
but
always
remember
that
no
matter
what
obstacles
stand
in
our
way
nothing
can
stand
in
the
way
of
the
power
of
millions
of
voices
calling
for
change
we
have
been
told
we
can
not
do
this
by
chorus
of
cynics
and
they
will
only
grow
louder
and
more
dissonant
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
we
been
asked
to
pause
for
reality
check
we
been
warned
against
offering
the
people
of
this
nation
false
hope
but
in
the
unlikely
story
that
is
america
there
has
never
been
anything
false
about
hope
for
when
we
have
faced
down
impossible
odds
when
we
been
told
we
not
ready
or
that
we
should
try
or
that
we
generations
of
americans
have
responded
with
simple
creed
that
sums
up
the
spirit
of
people
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
it
was
creed
written
into
the
founding
documents
that
declared
the
destiny
of
nation
yes
we
can
it
was
whispered
by
slaves
and
abolitionists
as
they
blazed
trail
towards
freedom
through
the
darkest
of
nights
yes
we
can
it
was
sung
by
immigrants
as
they
struck
out
from
distant
shores
and
pioneers
who
pushed
westward
against
an
unforgiving
wilderness
yes
we
can
it
was
the
call
of
workers
who
women
who
reached
for
the
ballot
president
who
chose
the
moon
as
our
new
frontier
and
king
who
took
us
to
the
and
pointed
the
way
to
the
promised
land
yes
we
can
to
justice
and
equality
yes
we
can
to
opportunity
and
prosperity
yes
we
can
heal
this
nation
yes
we
can
repair
this
world
yes
we
can
and
so
tomorrow
as
we
take
the
campaign
south
and
west
as
we
learn
that
the
struggles
of
the
textile
workers
in
are
not
so
different
than
the
plight
of
the
dishwasher
in
las
that
the
hopes
of
the
little
girl
who
goes
to
the
crumbling
school
in
are
the
same
as
the
dreams
of
the
boy
who
learns
on
the
streets
of
we
will
remember
that
there
is
something
happening
in
america
that
we
are
not
as
divided
as
our
politics
suggest
that
we
are
one
people
we
are
one
nation
and
together
we
will
begin
the
next
great
chapter
in
the
american
story
with
three
words
that
will
ring
from
coast
to
coast
from
sea
to
shining
sea
yes
we
can
thank
you
new
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
you
know
they
said
they
said
they
said
this
day
would
never
come
they
said
our
sights
were
set
too
high
they
said
this
country
was
too
divided
too
disillusioned
to
ever
come
together
around
common
purpose
but
on
this
january
night
at
this
defining
moment
in
history
you
have
done
what
the
cynics
said
we
could
do
you
have
done
what
the
state
of
new
can
do
in
five
days
you
have
done
what
america
can
do
in
this
new
year
in
lines
that
stretched
around
schools
and
churches
in
small
towns
and
in
big
cities
you
came
together
as
democrats
republicans
and
independents
to
stand
up
and
say
that
we
are
one
nation
we
are
one
people
and
our
time
for
change
has
come
you
said
the
time
has
come
to
move
beyond
the
bitterness
and
pettiness
and
anger
that
consumed
washington
to
end
the
political
strategy
that
been
all
about
division
and
instead
make
it
about
addition
to
build
coalition
for
change
that
stretches
through
red
states
and
blue
states
because
that
how
we
win
in
november
and
that
how
we
finally
meet
the
challenges
that
we
face
as
nation
we
are
choosing
hope
over
fear
we
choosing
unity
over
division
and
sending
powerful
message
that
change
is
coming
to
america
you
said
the
time
has
come
to
tell
the
lobbyists
who
think
their
money
and
their
influence
speak
louder
than
our
voices
that
they
do
own
this
government
we
do
and
we
are
here
to
take
it
back
the
time
has
come
for
president
who
will
be
honest
about
the
choices
and
the
challenges
we
face
who
will
listen
to
you
and
learn
from
you
even
when
we
disagree
who
just
tell
you
what
you
want
to
hear
but
what
you
need
to
know
and
in
new
if
you
give
me
the
same
chance
that
did
tonight
will
be
that
president
for
america
be
president
who
finally
makes
health
care
affordable
and
available
to
every
single
american
the
same
way
expanded
health
care
in
illinois
by
by
bringing
democrats
and
republicans
together
to
get
the
job
done
be
president
who
ends
the
tax
breaks
for
companies
that
ship
our
jobs
overseas
and
put
tax
cut
into
the
pockets
of
working
americans
who
deserve
it
be
president
who
harnesses
the
ingenuity
of
farmers
and
scientists
and
entrepreneurs
to
free
this
nation
from
the
tyranny
of
oil
once
and
for
all
and
be
president
who
ends
this
war
in
iraq
and
finally
brings
our
troops
home
who
restores
our
moral
standing
who
understands
that
is
not
way
to
scare
up
votes
but
challenge
that
should
unite
america
and
the
world
against
the
common
threats
of
the
century
common
threats
of
terrorism
and
nuclear
weapons
climate
change
and
poverty
genocide
and
disease
tonight
we
are
one
step
closer
to
that
vision
of
america
because
of
what
you
did
here
in
and
so
especially
like
to
thank
the
and
the
precinct
captains
the
volunteers
and
the
staff
who
made
this
all
possible
and
while
at
it
on
thank
you
think
it
makes
sense
for
me
to
thank
the
love
of
my
life
the
rock
of
the
family
the
closer
on
the
campaign
trail
give
it
up
for
know
you
did
do
this
for
me
you
did
this
you
did
this
because
you
believed
so
deeply
in
the
most
american
of
ideas
that
in
the
face
of
impossible
odds
people
who
love
this
country
can
change
it
know
this
know
this
because
while
may
be
standing
here
tonight
never
forget
that
my
journey
began
on
the
streets
of
chicago
doing
what
so
many
of
you
have
done
for
this
campaign
and
all
the
campaigns
here
in
and
working
and
fighting
to
make
people
lives
just
little
bit
better
know
how
hard
it
is
it
comes
with
little
sleep
little
pay
and
lot
of
sacrifice
there
are
days
of
disappointment
but
sometimes
just
sometimes
there
are
nights
like
this
night
night
that
years
from
now
when
we
made
the
changes
we
believe
in
when
more
families
can
afford
to
see
doctor
when
our
children
when
and
and
your
children
inherit
planet
that
little
cleaner
and
safer
when
the
world
sees
america
differently
and
america
sees
itself
as
nation
less
divided
and
more
united
you
be
able
to
look
back
with
pride
and
say
that
this
was
the
moment
when
it
all
began
this
was
the
moment
when
the
improbable
beat
what
washington
always
said
was
inevitable
this
was
the
moment
when
we
tore
down
barriers
that
have
divided
us
for
too
long
when
we
rallied
people
of
all
parties
and
ages
to
common
cause
when
we
finally
gave
americans
who
had
never
participated
in
politics
reason
to
stand
up
and
to
do
so
this
was
the
moment
when
we
finally
beat
back
the
tics
of
fear
and
doubt
and
cynicism
the
politics
where
we
tear
each
other
down
instead
of
lifting
this
country
up
this
was
the
moment
years
from
now
you
look
back
and
you
say
that
this
was
the
moment
this
was
the
place
where
america
remembered
what
it
means
to
hope
for
many
months
we
been
teased
even
derided
for
talking
about
hope
but
we
always
knew
that
hope
is
not
blind
optimism
it
not
ignoring
the
enormity
of
the
tasks
ahead
or
the
roadblocks
that
stand
in
our
path
it
not
sitting
on
the
sidelines
or
shirking
from
fight
hope
is
that
thing
inside
us
that
insists
despite
all
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
something
better
awaits
us
if
we
have
the
courage
to
reach
for
it
and
to
work
for
it
and
to
fight
for
it
hope
is
what
saw
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
woman
in
cedar
rapids
who
works
the
night
shift
after
full
day
of
college
and
still
afford
health
care
for
sister
who
ill
young
woman
who
still
believes
that
this
country
will
give
her
the
chance
to
live
out
her
dreams
hope
is
what
heard
in
the
voice
of
the
new
woman
who
told
me
that
she
has
been
able
to
breathe
since
her
nephew
left
for
iraq
who
still
goes
to
bed
each
night
praying
for
his
safe
return
hope
is
what
led
band
of
colonists
to
rise
up
against
an
empire
what
led
the
greatest
of
generations
to
free
continent
and
heal
nation
what
led
young
women
and
young
men
to
sit
at
lunch
counters
and
brave
fire
hoses
and
march
through
and
for
freedom
cause
hope
hope
is
what
led
me
here
today
with
father
from
kenya
mother
from
and
story
that
could
only
happen
in
the
united
states
of
america
hope
is
the
bedrock
of
this
nation
the
belief
that
our
destiny
will
not
be
written
for
us
but
by
us
by
all
those
men
and
women
who
are
not
content
to
settle
for
the
world
as
it
is
who
have
the
courage
to
remake
the
world
as
it
should
be
that
is
what
we
started
here
in
and
that
is
the
message
we
can
now
carry
to
new
and
beyond
the
same
message
we
had
when
we
were
up
and
when
we
were
down
the
one
that
can
save
this
country
brick
by
brick
block
by
block
calloused
hand
by
calloused
hand
that
together
ordinary
people
can
do
extraordinary
things
because
we
are
not
collection
of
red
states
and
blue
states
we
are
the
united
states
of
america
and
in
this
moment
in
this
election
we
are
ready
to
believe
again
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
so
much
to
to
the
great
governor
of
and
lieutenant
governor
of
to
my
dear
friend
for
the
outstanding
work
that
he
does
to
the
congressional
delegation
of
that
is
doing
outstanding
work
and
to
madam
speaker
thank
you
all
for
the
wonderful
welcome
and
the
wonderful
hospitality
love
you
back
to
audience
little
less
than
one
year
from
today
you
will
go
into
the
voting
booth
and
you
will
select
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
now
the
good
news
the
name
george
bush
will
not
be
on
the
ballot
the
name
of
my
cousin
will
not
be
on
the
ballot
been
trying
to
hide
that
for
long
time
everybody
has
black
sheep
in
the
family
the
era
of
scooter
justice
and
brownie
incompetence
and
rove
politics
will
finally
be
over
but
the
question
going
to
have
to
ask
yourself
when
you
caucus
in
january
and
you
vote
in
november
is
next
for
america
we
are
in
defining
moment
in
our
history
our
nation
is
at
war
the
planet
is
in
peril
the
dream
that
so
many
generations
fought
for
feels
as
if
slowly
slipping
away
we
are
working
harder
for
less
never
paid
more
for
health
care
or
for
college
harder
to
save
and
harder
to
retire
and
most
of
all
lost
faith
that
our
leaders
can
or
will
do
anything
about
it
we
were
promised
compassionate
conservatism
and
all
we
got
was
and
we
were
promised
and
we
got
president
who
could
not
even
lead
the
half
of
the
country
that
voted
for
him
we
were
promised
more
ethical
and
more
efficient
government
and
instead
we
have
town
called
washington
that
is
more
corrupt
and
more
wasteful
than
it
was
before
and
the
only
mission
that
was
ever
accomplished
is
to
use
fear
and
falsehood
to
take
this
country
to
war
that
should
have
never
been
and
should
have
never
been
waged
it
is
because
of
these
failures
that
america
is
listening
intently
to
what
we
say
here
today
not
just
democrats
but
republicans
and
independents
lost
trust
in
their
government
but
want
to
believe
again
and
it
is
because
of
these
failures
that
we
not
only
have
moment
of
great
challenge
but
also
moment
of
great
opportunity
we
have
chance
to
bring
the
country
together
in
new
majority
to
finally
tackle
problems
that
george
bush
made
far
worse
but
that
had
festered
long
before
george
bush
ever
took
office
problems
that
talked
about
year
after
year
after
year
after
year
and
that
is
why
the
same
old
washington
textbook
campaigns
just
do
in
this
election
why
not
answering
questions
we
are
afraid
our
answers
be
popular
just
why
telling
the
american
people
what
we
think
they
want
to
hear
instead
of
telling
the
american
people
what
they
need
to
hear
just
do
triangulating
and
positions
because
worried
about
what
mitt
or
might
say
about
us
just
do
if
we
are
really
serious
about
wining
this
election
democrats
we
live
in
fear
of
losing
it
this
party
the
party
of
and
of
and
kennedy
has
always
made
the
biggest
difference
in
the
lives
of
the
american
people
when
we
led
not
by
polls
but
by
principle
not
by
calculation
but
by
conviction
when
we
summoned
the
entire
nation
to
common
purpose
higher
purpose
and
run
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
of
america
because
the
party
america
needs
us
to
be
right
now
party
that
offers
not
just
difference
in
policies
but
difference
in
leadership
party
that
just
focus
on
how
to
win
but
why
we
should
party
that
just
offer
change
as
slogan
but
real
meaningful
change
change
that
america
can
believe
in
why
in
this
race
why
am
running
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
of
america
to
offer
change
that
we
can
believe
in
am
in
this
race
to
tell
the
corporate
lobbyists
that
their
days
of
setting
the
agenda
in
washington
are
over
have
done
more
than
any
other
candidate
in
this
race
to
take
on
lobbyists
and
won
they
have
not
funded
my
campaign
they
will
not
get
job
in
my
white
house
and
they
will
not
drown
out
the
voices
of
the
american
people
when
am
president
in
this
race
to
take
those
tax
breaks
away
from
companies
that
are
moving
jobs
overseas
and
put
them
in
the
pockets
of
hard
working
americans
who
deserve
it
and
raise
the
minimum
wage
every
ten
years
will
raise
it
to
keep
pace
so
that
workers
fall
behind
that
is
why
am
in
it
to
protect
the
american
worker
to
fight
for
the
american
worker
in
this
race
because
want
to
stop
talking
about
the
outrage
of
million
americans
without
health
care
and
start
actually
doing
something
about
it
expanded
health
care
in
illinois
by
bringing
democrats
and
republicans
together
by
taking
on
the
insurance
industry
and
that
is
how
will
make
certain
that
every
single
american
in
this
country
has
health
care
they
can
count
on
and
do
it
twenty
years
from
now
do
it
ten
years
from
now
will
do
it
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
as
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
run
for
president
to
make
sure
that
every
american
child
has
the
best
education
that
we
have
to
offer
from
the
day
they
are
born
to
the
day
they
graduate
from
college
and
just
talk
about
how
great
teachers
are
as
president
will
reward
them
for
their
greatness
by
raising
salaries
and
giving
them
more
support
why
in
this
race
am
running
for
president
because
am
sick
and
tired
of
democrats
thinking
that
the
only
way
to
look
tough
on
national
security
is
by
talking
and
acting
and
voting
like
george
bush
republicans
when
am
this
nominee
my
opponent
will
not
be
able
to
say
that
voted
for
the
war
in
iraq
or
that
gave
george
bush
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
iran
or
that
supported
policies
of
not
talking
to
leaders
that
we
like
and
he
will
not
be
able
to
say
that
wavered
on
something
as
fundamental
as
whether
or
not
it
is
ok
for
america
to
torture
because
it
is
never
why
am
in
it
as
president
will
end
the
war
in
iraq
we
will
have
our
troops
home
in
sixteen
months
will
close
will
restore
corpus
will
finish
the
fight
against
and
will
lead
the
world
to
combat
the
common
threats
of
the
century
nuclear
weapons
and
terrorism
climate
change
and
poverty
genocide
and
disease
and
will
send
once
more
message
to
those
yearning
faces
beyond
our
shores
that
says
matter
to
us
your
future
is
our
future
and
our
moment
is
america
our
moment
is
now
our
moment
is
now
want
to
spend
the
next
year
or
the
next
four
years
the
same
fights
that
we
had
in
the
want
to
pit
red
america
against
blue
america
want
to
be
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
if
those
republicans
come
at
me
with
the
same
and
that
they
usually
do
then
will
take
them
head
on
because
believe
the
american
people
are
tired
of
fear
and
tired
of
distractions
and
tired
of
diversions
we
can
make
this
election
not
about
fear
but
about
the
future
and
that
just
be
democratic
victory
that
will
be
an
american
victory
and
that
is
victory
america
needs
right
now
am
not
in
this
race
to
some
ambitions
or
because
believe
somehow
owed
to
me
never
expected
to
be
here
always
knew
this
journey
was
improbable
never
been
on
journey
that
am
running
in
this
race
because
of
what
king
called
fierce
urgency
of
because
believe
that
such
thing
as
being
too
late
and
that
hour
is
almost
upon
us
want
to
wake
up
four
years
from
now
and
find
out
that
millions
of
americans
still
lack
health
care
because
we
take
on
the
insurance
industry
want
to
see
that
the
oceans
have
risen
few
more
inches
the
planet
has
reached
point
of
no
return
because
we
find
way
to
stop
buying
oil
from
dictators
want
to
see
more
american
lives
put
at
risk
because
no
one
had
the
judgment
or
the
courage
to
stand
up
against
misguided
war
before
we
sent
our
troops
into
fight
want
to
see
homeless
veterans
on
the
streets
want
to
send
another
generation
of
american
children
to
failing
schools
want
that
future
for
my
daughters
want
that
future
for
your
sons
do
not
want
that
future
for
america
in
this
race
for
the
same
reason
that
fought
for
jobs
for
the
jobless
and
hope
for
the
hopeless
on
the
streets
of
chicago
for
the
same
reason
fought
for
justice
and
equality
as
civil
rights
lawyer
for
the
same
reason
that
fought
for
illinois
families
for
over
decade
because
will
never
forget
that
the
only
reason
that
standing
here
today
is
because
somebody
somewhere
stood
up
for
me
when
it
was
risky
stood
up
when
it
was
hard
stood
up
when
it
popular
and
because
that
somebody
stood
up
few
more
stood
up
and
then
few
thousand
stood
up
and
then
few
million
stood
up
and
standing
up
with
courage
and
clear
purpose
they
somehow
managed
to
change
the
world
why
running
to
give
our
children
and
grandchildren
the
same
chances
somebody
gave
me
why
running
democrats
to
keep
the
american
dream
alive
for
those
who
still
hunger
for
opportunity
who
still
thirst
for
equality
why
asking
you
to
stand
with
me
why
asking
you
to
caucus
for
me
why
am
asking
you
to
stop
settling
for
what
the
cynics
say
we
have
to
accept
in
this
election
in
this
moment
let
us
reach
for
what
we
know
is
possible
nation
healed
world
repaired
an
america
that
believes
again
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
very
much
president
president
on
senator
and
hold
constituent
coffee
so
we
can
hear
from
the
folks
back
home
young
man
came
few
months
ago
who
was
about
years
old
he
had
been
in
iraq
for
year
the
first
he
had
been
back
from
iraq
for
year
the
first
six
months
of
that
year
had
been
spent
in
coma
an
explosion
had
shattered
his
face
blinded
him
in
both
eyes
has
left
him
without
the
use
of
one
arm
he
talked
to
us
about
how
he
was
going
through
he
introduced
us
to
his
family
he
has
wife
and
two
young
daughters
like
do
and
his
wife
talked
for
bit
about
the
adjustments
they
were
making
at
home
since
dad
got
hurt
and
found
myself
looking
at
not
just
him
but
his
wife
who
loves
him
so
much
and
thought
about
how
their
lives
were
forever
changed
because
of
the
decision
that
was
carried
out
four
years
ago
the
sacrifices
of
war
are
immeasurable
first
made
this
point
in
the
fall
of
at
the
end
of
the
that
gave
opposing
the
invasion
of
iraq
said
then
that
certainly
do
not
oppose
all
wars
rather
oppose
dumb
wars
rash
wars
wars
that
are
based
on
passion
as
opposed
to
wars
based
on
sober
assessment
of
our
national
security
interests
because
there
no
decision
more
profound
than
the
one
we
make
to
send
our
brave
men
and
women
into
way
thought
about
these
words
from
time
to
time
since
that
but
never
so
much
as
the
day
saw
that
young
man
and
his
wife
and
understood
the
degree
to
which
their
lives
had
been
turn
upside
down
the
sacrifices
of
war
are
immeasurable
too
many
have
returned
from
iraq
with
that
story
with
broken
bodies
and
shattered
nerves
and
wounds
that
even
the
best
care
may
not
heal
too
many
of
our
best
have
come
home
shrouded
in
the
flag
they
loved
too
many
moms
and
dads
and
husbands
and
wives
have
answered
that
knock
on
the
door
hardest
for
any
loved
one
to
hear
and
the
rest
of
us
have
seen
too
many
promises
of
swift
victories
and
dying
and
budding
democracy
giving
way
to
the
reality
of
brutal
civil
war
that
goes
on
and
on
and
on
to
this
day
the
sacrifices
of
war
president
are
immeasurable
it
was
not
impossible
to
see
back
then
that
we
might
arrive
at
the
place
at
today
said
then
that
war
based
not
on
reason
but
on
passion
not
on
principle
but
on
politics
would
lead
to
occupation
of
undetermined
length
at
undetermined
cost
with
undetermined
consequences
believed
that
an
invasion
of
iraq
without
clear
rationale
or
strong
international
support
would
only
strengthen
the
recruitment
arm
of
and
erode
the
good
standing
and
moral
authority
that
took
our
country
generations
to
build
there
were
other
experts
and
leaders
and
everyday
americans
who
believed
this
too
wish
had
been
wrong
wish
we
here
talking
about
this
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
year
because
the
consequences
of
this
war
have
been
profound
and
the
sacrifices
have
been
immeasurable
president
those
who
would
have
us
continue
this
war
in
perpetuity
like
to
say
that
this
is
matter
of
resolve
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
but
the
american
people
have
been
extraordinarily
resolved
they
seen
their
sons
and
daughters
killed
and
wounded
on
the
streets
of
they
spent
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
on
this
effort
money
that
could
have
been
devoted
to
strengthening
our
homeland
and
our
competitive
standing
as
nation
it
is
not
failure
of
resolve
that
has
led
us
into
this
chaos
but
failed
strategy
strategy
that
has
only
strengthened
strategic
position
increased
threats
posed
by
terrorist
reduced
credibility
and
influence
around
the
world
and
placed
israel
and
other
nations
friendly
to
the
united
states
in
the
region
in
greater
peril
iraq
has
not
been
failure
of
resolve
it
has
been
failure
of
strategy
and
that
strategy
must
change
it
is
time
to
bring
responsible
end
to
involvement
in
this
conflict
is
now
it
become
apparent
president
that
there
no
military
solution
to
this
war
no
amount
of
soldiers
not
more
not
more
not
almost
more
than
we
know
that
we
know
we
are
sending
can
solve
the
grievances
that
lay
at
the
heart
of
someone
civil
war
our
troops
can
not
serve
as
their
diplomats
and
we
can
no
longer
referee
their
civil
war
we
must
begin
phased
withdrawal
of
our
forces
starting
may
with
the
goal
of
removing
all
combat
forces
by
march
we
also
must
make
sure
that
not
as
careless
getting
out
of
this
war
as
we
were
getting
in
and
why
this
withdrawal
should
be
gradual
and
maintain
some
troops
in
the
region
to
prevent
wider
war
in
the
region
while
they
can
also
work
on
going
after
and
other
terrorists
but
this
phased
withdrawal
president
must
begin
soon
letting
the
iraqis
know
that
we
will
not
be
there
forever
is
our
last
best
hope
to
pressure
the
iraqis
to
take
ownership
of
their
country
and
bring
an
end
to
their
conflict
it
is
time
for
our
troops
to
start
coming
home
history
will
not
judge
president
the
architects
of
this
war
kindly
but
the
books
have
yet
to
be
written
on
our
effort
to
right
the
wrongs
we
see
in
iraq
the
story
has
yet
to
be
told
about
how
we
turned
from
this
moment
found
our
way
out
of
the
desert
and
took
to
heart
the
lessons
of
war
that
too
many
refused
to
heed
back
then
for
it
is
of
little
use
or
comfort
to
recall
past
advice
and
warnings
if
we
do
not
allow
them
to
guide
us
in
the
challenges
that
lie
ahead
president
threats
loom
large
in
an
age
where
terrorist
networks
thrive
and
there
will
certainly
be
times
when
we
have
to
call
on
our
brave
servicemen
and
women
to
risk
their
lives
again
but
before
we
make
that
most
profound
of
all
decisions
before
we
send
our
best
off
to
battle
we
must
remember
what
led
us
to
this
day
and
learn
from
the
principles
that
follow
we
must
remember
that
ideology
is
not
foreign
policy
we
must
not
embark
on
war
based
on
untested
theories
political
agendas
or
wishful
thinking
that
has
basis
that
has
little
basis
in
fact
or
reality
we
must
focus
our
efforts
on
the
threats
we
know
exist
and
we
must
evaluate
those
threats
with
sound
intelligence
that
is
never
manipulated
for
political
reasons
president
we
must
remember
that
the
cost
of
going
it
alone
is
immense
it
is
choice
we
sometimes
have
to
make
but
one
that
must
be
made
rarely
and
always
reluctantly
that
because
standing
in
the
world
is
precious
resource
not
easily
rebuilt
we
value
the
cooperation
and
goodwill
of
other
nations
not
because
it
makes
us
feel
good
but
because
it
makes
all
the
world
safer
because
the
only
way
to
battle
century
threats
that
race
across
the
borders
threats
like
terror
and
disease
and
nuclear
proliferation
is
to
enlist
the
resources
and
support
of
all
nations
to
win
our
wider
struggle
we
must
let
people
across
this
planet
know
that
there
is
another
more
hopeful
alternative
to
the
hateful
ideologies
the
terrorists
espouse
and
renewed
and
renewed
america
will
reflect
and
champion
that
vision
president
we
must
remember
that
planning
for
peace
is
just
as
critical
as
planning
for
war
iraq
was
not
just
failure
of
conception
but
failure
of
execution
and
so
when
conflict
does
arise
that
requires
our
involvement
we
must
understand
that
history
its
politics
its
ethnic
and
religious
divisions
before
our
troops
ever
set
foot
on
its
soil
we
must
understand
that
setting
up
ballot
boxes
does
not
democracy
make
that
real
freedom
and
real
stability
come
from
doing
the
hard
work
of
helping
to
build
strong
police
force
and
legitimate
government
and
ensuring
that
people
have
food
and
water
and
electricity
and
basic
services
and
we
must
be
honest
about
how
much
of
that
we
can
do
ourselves
and
how
much
must
come
from
the
people
themselves
finally
president
we
must
remember
that
when
we
send
our
servicemen
and
women
to
war
we
make
sure
we
give
them
the
training
they
need
and
the
equipment
that
will
keep
them
safe
and
mission
that
they
can
accomplish
we
must
respect
our
advice
not
just
when
its
politically
convenient
but
even
when
not
what
we
want
to
hear
and
when
our
troops
come
home
it
is
our
most
solemn
responsibility
to
make
sure
they
come
home
to
the
services
and
the
benefits
and
the
care
they
deserve
as
we
stand
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
year
of
this
war
president
let
us
remember
let
us
remember
that
young
man
from
illinois
and
his
wife
and
his
daughters
and
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
families
who
are
living
the
very
real
consequences
and
immeasurable
sacrifices
that
have
come
from
our
decision
to
invade
iraq
we
are
so
blessed
in
this
country
to
have
so
many
men
and
women
like
this
americans
willing
to
put
on
that
uniform
and
say
the
hard
goodbyes
and
risk
their
lives
in
far
off
land
because
they
know
that
such
consequences
and
sacrifices
are
sometimes
necessary
to
defend
our
country
and
achieve
lasting
peace
that
is
why
we
have
no
greater
responsibility
than
to
ensure
the
decision
to
place
them
in
way
is
the
right
one
and
that
is
why
we
must
learn
the
lessons
of
iraq
it
is
what
we
owe
our
soldiers
it
is
what
we
owe
their
families
and
it
is
what
we
owe
our
country
now
and
all
the
days
and
months
to
come
thank
you
president
yield
the
floor
president
rise
first
to
offer
strong
words
of
support
for
the
statement
that
was
just
offered
by
the
distinguished
senator
from
as
well
rise
today
to
speak
in
support
of
the
iraq
resolution
that
the
senate
will
consider
tomorrow
president
the
news
from
iraq
is
very
bad
last
week
suicide
bomber
stood
outside
and
killed
people
other
attacks
killed
pilgrims
on
sunday
car
bomb
went
off
in
central
baghdad
and
more
than
people
died
and
the
road
from
the
airport
into
baghdad
is
littered
with
debris
craters
from
improvised
explosive
devices
and
the
memories
of
our
sons
and
daughters
president
the
civil
war
in
iraq
rages
on
the
insurgents
have
started
to
change
their
tactics
they
hide
in
buildings
and
along
the
streets
and
wait
for
our
helicopters
they
shot
down
at
least
eight
helicopters
in
the
last
month
more
of
our
soldiers
are
dying
and
coming
home
with
their
bodies
broken
and
their
nerves
shattered
at
system
completely
unprepared
for
what
they
need
to
rebuild
their
lives
president
it
is
not
enough
for
the
president
to
tell
us
that
victory
in
this
war
is
simply
matter
of
american
resolve
the
american
people
have
been
extraordinarily
resolved
they
seen
their
sons
and
daughters
killed
or
wounded
in
the
streets
of
they
spent
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
on
this
effort
money
that
they
know
could
have
been
devoted
to
strengthening
our
homeland
security
and
our
competitive
standing
as
nation
the
failure
has
not
been
failure
of
resolve
that
not
what
led
us
into
chaos
it
been
failure
of
strategy
and
it
time
that
the
strategy
change
there
is
no
military
solution
president
to
the
civil
war
that
rages
on
in
iraq
and
it
time
for
us
to
redeploy
so
that
political
solution
becomes
possible
the
news
from
iraq
is
very
bad
and
it
been
that
way
for
at
least
four
years
we
all
wish
the
that
the
land
the
president
and
the
vice
president
speak
of
exists
we
wish
that
there
was
an
iraq
where
the
insurgency
was
in
the
last
where
the
people
work
with
security
where
children
play
outside
where
vibrant
new
democracy
lights
up
the
sky
we
wish
for
those
things
but
there
no
alternative
reality
to
what
we
see
and
read
about
in
the
news
to
what
we
experienced
these
long
four
years
repeat
president
there
is
no
military
solution
to
this
war
at
this
point
no
amount
of
soldiers
can
solve
the
grievances
at
the
heart
of
someone
else
civil
war
the
iraqi
people
and
must
come
to
the
table
and
reach
political
settlement
themselves
if
they
want
peace
they
must
do
the
hard
work
necessary
to
achieve
it
our
failed
strategy
in
iraq
has
strengthened
iran
strategic
position
reduced
credibility
and
influence
around
the
world
placed
israel
and
other
nations
friendly
to
the
united
states
in
the
region
in
greater
peril
these
are
not
the
signs
of
plan
it
time
for
profound
change
this
is
what
we
trying
to
do
here
today
we
saying
it
is
time
to
start
making
plans
to
redeploy
our
troops
so
that
they
can
focus
on
the
wider
struggle
against
terrorism
win
the
war
in
strengthen
our
position
in
the
middle
east
and
pressure
the
iraqis
to
reach
political
settlement
even
if
this
effort
falls
short
we
will
continue
to
try
to
accomplish
what
the
american
people
asked
for
last
november
glad
to
see
though
that
this
new
effort
is
gaining
consensus
and
want
to
commend
senator
for
his
efforts
he
took
the
time
to
listen
so
many
of
us
from
both
chambers
of
congress
could
help
develop
this
plan
the
decision
in
particular
to
begin
phased
redeployment
with
the
goal
of
redeploying
all
our
combat
forces
by
march
is
the
right
step
it
measure
the
iraq
study
group
spoke
of
an
idea
borrowed
from
them
an
idea
that
in
bill
introduced
now
has
more
than
from
house
and
senate
and
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
they
supported
this
plan
since
announced
similar
plan
in
january
the
decision
allows
some
forces
to
remain
in
iraq
with
clear
mission
to
protect
and
coalition
personnel
conduct
operations
and
to
train
and
equip
iraqi
forces
and
that
is
smart
decision
president
spoke
at
conference
and
warned
that
the
violence
in
iraq
could
spread
throughout
the
region
if
it
goes
unchecked
by
maintaining
strong
presence
in
iraq
and
the
middle
east
as
both
my
bill
and
the
leadership
bill
does
we
can
ensure
that
the
chaos
does
not
spread
should
also
add
that
the
decision
to
begin
this
phased
redeployment
within
days
is
practical
one
our
military
options
have
been
exhausted
it
time
to
seek
political
solution
to
this
war
and
with
this
decision
we
send
clear
signal
to
the
parties
involved
that
they
need
to
arrive
at
an
accommodation
president
while
strongly
believe
that
this
war
never
should
have
been
believe
we
must
be
as
careful
in
ending
the
war
as
we
were
careless
getting
in
while
prefer
my
approach
as
reflected
in
my
bill
believe
that
this
new
resolution
does
begin
to
point
policy
in
iraq
and
the
region
in
the
right
direction
an
end
to
the
war
and
achieving
political
solution
to
iraq
civil
war
will
not
happen
unless
we
demand
it
peace
with
stability
does
just
happen
because
we
wish
for
it
it
comes
when
we
never
give
in
and
never
give
up
and
never
tire
of
working
towards
life
on
earth
worthy
of
our
human
dignity
the
decisions
that
have
been
made
have
led
us
to
this
crossroads
moment
of
great
peril
president
we
have
choice
we
can
continue
down
the
road
that
weakened
our
credibility
and
damaged
our
strategic
interests
in
the
region
or
we
can
turn
toward
the
future
the
road
be
smooth
and
have
to
say
president
that
there
will
be
risks
with
any
approach
but
this
approach
is
our
last
best
hope
to
end
this
war
so
we
can
begin
to
bring
our
troops
home
and
begin
the
hard
work
of
securing
our
country
and
our
world
from
the
threats
that
we
face
the
president
has
said
he
will
continue
down
the
road
towards
more
troops
and
more
of
the
same
failed
policies
the
president
sought
and
won
from
congress
to
wage
this
war
from
the
start
but
he
is
now
dismissing
and
ignoring
the
will
of
the
american
people
that
is
tired
of
years
of
watching
the
human
and
financial
tolls
mount
president
the
news
from
iraq
is
very
bad
but
it
can
change
if
we
in
this
chamber
say
enough
let
this
day
be
the
day
that
begins
the
painful
and
difficult
work
of
moving
from
this
let
this
be
the
day
that
we
begin
pulling
towards
the
future
with
responsible
conclusion
to
this
painful
chapter
in
our
nation
history
president
let
this
be
the
day
when
we
finally
send
message
that
is
so
clear
and
so
emphatic
that
it
can
not
be
ignored
thank
you
president
yield
the
floor
thank
you
giving
all
praise
and
to
god
for
bringing
us
here
today
must
begin
because
at
the
unity
breakfast
this
morning
was
saving
for
last
and
the
list
was
so
long
left
him
out
after
that
introduction
so
going
to
start
by
saying
how
much
appreciate
the
friendship
and
the
support
and
the
outstanding
work
that
he
does
each
and
every
day

my

going
to
thank
reverend
because
he
stole
the
show
was
mentioning
earlier
know
we
got
in
the
audience
and
when
you
have
to
speak
in
front
of
somebody
who
martin
luther
king
said
was
the
greatest
preacher
he
ever
heard
then
you
got
some
problems
and
little
nervous
about
following
so
many
great
preachers
but
hoping
that
the
spirit
moves
me
and
to
all
my
colleagues
who
have
given
me
such
warm
welcome
thank
you
very
much

speak
to
you
here
today
you
know
several
weeks
ago
after
had
announced
that
was
running
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
stood
in
front
of
the
old
state
capitol
in
illinois
where
abraham
lincoln
delivered
his
declaring
drawing
in
scripture
that
house
divided
against
itself
could
not
stand
and
stood
and
announced
that
was
running
for
the
presidency
and
there
were
lot
of
commentators
as
they
are
prone
to
do
who
questioned
the
audacity
of
young
man
like
myself
have
been
in
washington
too
long
and
acknowledge
that
there
is
certain
presumptuousness
about
this
but
got
letter
from
friend
of
some
of
yours
named
reverend
moss
in
and
his
son
moss
is
the
pastor
at
my
church
and
must
send
greetings
from
jeremiah
wright
but
got
letter
giving
me
encouragement
and
saying
how
proud
he
was
that
had
announced
and
encouraging
me
to
stay
true
to
my
ideals
and
my
values
and
not
to
be
fearful
and
he
said
if
there
some
folks
out
there
who
are
questioning
whether
or
not
you
should
run
just
tell
them
to
look
at
the
story
of
joshua
because
you
part
of
the
joshua
generation
so
just
want
to
talk
little
about
moses
and
aaron
and
joshua
because
we
are
in
the
presence
today
of
lot
of
we
in
the
presence
today
of
giants
whose
shoulders
we
stand
on
people
who
battled
not
just
on
behalf
of
african
americans
but
on
behalf
of
all
of
america
that
battled
for
america
soul
that
shed
blood
that
endured
taunts
and
formant
and
in
some
cases
gave
torment
and
in
some
cases
gave
the
full
measure
of
their
devotion
like
moses
they
challenged
pharaoh
the
princes
powers
who
said
that
some
are
atop
and
others
are
at
the
bottom
and
that
how
it
always
going
to
be
there
were
people
like
anna
cooper
and
foster
and
jimmy
lee
and
reverend
john
who
said
we
can
imagine
something
different
and
we
know
there
is
something
out
there
for
us
too
thank
god
he
made
us
in
his
image
and
we
reject
the
notion
that
we
will
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
be
confined
to
station
of
inferiority
that
we
aspire
to
the
highest
of
heights
that
our
talents
be
expressed
to
their
fullest
and
so
because
of
what
they
endured
because
of
what
they
marched
they
led
people
out
of
bondage
they
took
them
across
the
sea
that
folks
thought
could
not
be
parted
they
wandered
through
desert
but
always
knowing
that
god
was
with
them
and
that
if
they
maintained
that
trust
in
god
that
they
would
be
all
right
and
it
because
they
marched
that
the
next
generation
has
been
bloodied
so
much
it
because
they
marched
that
we
elected
congressmen
it
is
because
they
marched
that
we
have
and
it
is
because
they
marched
that
got
the
kind
of
education
got
law
degree
seat
in
the
illinois
senate
and
ultimately
in
the
united
states
senate
it
is
because
they
marched
that
stand
before
you
here
today
was
mentioning
at
the
unity
breakfast
this
morning
my
at
the
unity
breakfast
this
morning
that
my
debt
is
even
greater
than
that
because
not
only
is
my
career
the
result
of
the
work
of
the
men
and
women
who
we
here
today
my
very
existence
might
not
have
been
possible
had
it
not
been
for
some
of
the
folks
here
today
mentioned
at
the
unity
breakfast
that
lot
of
people
been
asking
well
you
know
your
father
was
from
africa
your
mother
she
white
woman
from
not
sure
that
you
have
the
same
experience
and
tried
to
explain
you
do
understand
you
see
my
grandfather
was
cook
to
the
british
in
kenya
grew
up
in
small
village
and
all
his
life
that
all
he
was
cook
and
house
boy
and
that
what
they
called
him
even
when
he
was
years
old
they
called
him
house
boy
they
would
call
him
by
his
last
name
sound
familiar
he
had
to
carry
around
because
africans
in
their
own
land
in
their
own
country
at
that
time
because
it
was
british
colony
could
not
move
about
freely
they
could
only
go
where
they
were
told
to
go
they
could
only
work
where
they
were
told
to
work
yet
something
happened
back
here
in
alabama
something
happened
in
that
sent
out
what
bobby
kennedy
called
ripples
of
hope
all
around
the
world
something
happened
when
bunch
of
women
decided
they
were
going
to
walk
instead
of
ride
the
bus
after
long
day
of
doing
somebody
else
laundry
looking
after
somebody
else
children
when
men
who
had
decided
that
enough
and
we
going
to
stand
up
for
our
dignity
that
sent
shout
across
oceans
so
that
my
grandfather
began
to
imagine
something
different
for
his
son
his
son
who
grew
up
herding
goats
in
small
village
in
africa
could
suddenly
set
his
sights
little
higher
and
believe
that
maybe
black
man
in
this
world
had
chance
what
happened
in
alabama
and
also
stirred
the
conscience
of
the
nation
it
worried
folks
in
the
white
house
who
said
you
know
we
battling
communism
how
are
we
going
to
win
hearts
and
minds
all
across
the
world
if
right
here
in
our
own
country
john
we
not
observing
the
ideals
set
fort
in
our
constitution
we
might
be
accused
of
being
hypocrites
so
the
kennedy
decided
we
going
to
do
an
air
lift
we
going
to
go
to
africa
and
start
bringing
young
africans
over
to
this
country
and
give
them
scholarships
to
study
so
they
can
learn
what
wonderful
country
america
is
this
young
man
named
got
one
of
those
tickets
and
came
over
to
this
country
he
met
this
woman
whose
great
had
owned
slaves
but
she
had
good
idea
there
was
some
craziness
going
on
because
they
looked
at
each
other
and
they
decided
that
we
know
that
the
world
as
it
has
been
it
might
not
be
possible
for
us
to
get
together
and
have
child
there
was
something
stirring
across
the
country
because
of
what
happened
in
alabama
because
some
folks
are
willing
to
march
across
bridge
so
they
got
together
and
was
born
so
do
tell
me
do
have
claim
on
alabama
do
tell
me
not
coming
home
to
alabama
here
because
somebody
marched
here
because
you
all
sacrificed
for
me
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
thank
the
moses
generation
but
we
got
to
remember
now
that
joshua
still
had
job
to
do
as
great
as
moses
was
despite
all
that
he
did
leading
people
out
of
bondage
he
did
cross
over
the
river
to
see
the
promised
land
god
told
him
your
job
is
done
you
see
it
you
be
at
the
mountain
top
and
you
can
see
what
promised
what
promised
to
abraham
and
and
jacob
you
will
see
that
fulfilled
that
promise
but
you
go
there
we
going
to
leave
it
to
the
joshua
generation
to
make
sure
it
happens
there
are
still
battles
that
need
to
be
fought
some
rivers
that
need
to
be
crossed
like
moses
the
task
was
passed
on
to
those
who
might
not
have
been
as
deserving
might
not
have
been
as
courageous
find
themselves
in
front
of
the
risks
that
their
parents
and
grandparents
and
great
grandparents
had
taken
that
does
mean
that
they
do
still
have
burden
to
shoulder
that
they
do
have
some
responsibilities
the
previous
generation
the
moses
generation
pointed
the
way
they
took
us
of
the
way
there
we
still
got
that
in
order
to
cross
over
to
the
other
side
so
the
question
guess
that
have
today
is
what
called
of
us
in
this
joshua
generation
what
do
we
do
in
order
to
that
legacy
to
the
obligations
and
the
debt
that
we
owe
to
those
who
allowed
us
to
be
here
today
now
do
think
we
could
ever
fully
repay
that
debt
think
that
we
always
going
to
be
looking
back
but
there
are
at
least
few
suggestions
that
would
have
in
terms
of
how
we
might
that
enormous
legacy
the
first
is
to
our
history
john
talked
about
why
we
here
today
but
worry
sometimes
we
got
black
history
month
we
come
down
and
march
every
year
once
year
we
occasionally
celebrate
the
various
events
of
the
civil
rights
movement
we
celebrate
king
birthday
but
it
strikes
me
that
understanding
our
history
and
knowing
what
it
means
is
an
everyday
activity
moses
told
the
joshua
generation
do
forget
where
you
came
from
worry
sometimes
that
the
joshua
generation
in
its
success
forgets
where
it
came
from
thinks
it
does
have
to
make
as
many
sacrifices
thinks
that
the
very
height
of
ambition
is
to
make
as
much
money
as
you
can
to
drive
the
biggest
car
and
have
the
biggest
house
and
wear
watch
and
get
your
own
private
jet
get
some
of
that
money
and
think
that
good
thing
there
nothing
wrong
with
making
money
but
if
you
know
your
history
then
you
know
that
there
is
certain
poverty
of
ambition
involved
in
simply
striving
just
for
money
materialism
alone
will
not
the
possibilities
of
your
existence
you
have
to
fill
that
with
something
else
you
have
to
fill
it
with
the
golden
rule
you
got
to
fill
it
with
thinking
about
others
and
if
we
know
our
history
then
we
will
understand
that
that
is
the
highest
mark
of
service
second
thing
that
the
joshua
generation
needs
to
understand
is
that
the
principles
of
equality
that
were
set
fort
and
were
battled
for
have
to
be
fought
each
and
every
day
it
is
not
thing
was
remarking
at
the
unity
breakfast
on
the
fact
that
the
single
most
significant
concern
that
this
justice
department
under
this
administration
has
had
with
respect
to
discrimination
has
to
do
with
affirmative
action
that
they
have
basically
spent
all
their
time
worrying
about
colleges
and
universities
around
the
country
that
are
given
little
break
to
young
african
americans
and
to
make
sure
that
they
can
go
to
college
too
had
school
in
southern
illinois
that
set
up
program
for
in
math
and
science
for
african
americans
and
the
reason
they
had
set
it
up
is
because
we
only
had
less
than
of
the
in
science
and
math
go
to
african
americans
at
time
when
we
are
competing
in
global
economy
when
we
not
competing
just
against
folks
in
north
or
florida
or
california
we
competing
against
folks
in
china
and
india
and
we
need
math
and
science
majors
this
university
thought
this
might
be
nice
thing
to
do
and
the
justice
department
wrote
them
letter
saying
we
are
going
to
threaten
to
sue
you
for
reverse
discrimination
unless
you
cease
this
program
and
it
reminds
us
that
we
still
got
lot
of
work
to
do
and
that
the
basic
enforcement
of
laws
the
injustice
that
still
exists
within
our
criminal
justice
system
the
disparity
in
terms
of
how
people
are
treated
in
this
country
continues
it
has
gotten
better
and
we
should
never
deny
that
it
gotten
better
but
we
should
forget
that
better
is
not
good
enough
that
until
we
have
absolute
equality
in
this
country
in
terms
of
people
being
treated
on
the
basis
of
their
or
their
gender
that
that
is
something
that
we
got
to
continue
to
work
on
and
the
joshua
generation
has
significant
task
in
making
that
happen
third
thing
we
got
to
that
we
fought
for
civil
rights
but
we
still
got
lot
of
economic
rights
that
have
to
be
dealt
with
we
got
million
people
uninsured
in
this
country
despite
spending
more
money
on
health
care
than
any
nation
on
earth
it
makes
no
sense
as
consequence
we
got
what
known
as
health
care
disparity
in
this
nation
because
many
of
the
uninsured
are
african
american
or
latino
life
expectancy
is
lower
almost
every
disease
is
higher
within
minority
communities
the
health
care
gap
blacks
are
less
likely
in
their
schools
to
have
adequate
funding
we
have
teachers
in
those
schools
we
have
fewer
textbooks
in
those
schools
we
got
in
some
schools
rats
outnumbering
computers
that
called
the
achievement
gap
you
got
health
care
gap
and
you
got
an
achievement
gap
you
got
still
undone
went
down
to
new
three
weeks
ago
it
still
looks
bombed
out
still
not
rebuilt
when
happened
the
federal
government
had
special
program
of
grants
to
help
rebuild
they
waived
any
requirement
that
would
have
to
pay
of
the
cost
of
rebuilding
when
hurricane
andrew
happened
in
florida
requirement
they
waived
it
because
they
understood
that
some
disasters
are
so
devastating
that
we
expect
community
to
rebuild
new
the
largest
national
catastrophe
in
our
history
the
federal
government
says
where
your
there
is
an
empathy
gap
there
is
gap
in
terms
of
for
the
folks
in
new
it
not
gap
that
the
american
people
felt
because
we
saw
how
they
responded
but
somehow
our
government
did
respond
with
that
same
sense
of
compassion
with
that
same
sense
of
kindness
and
here
is
the
worst
part
the
tragedy
in
new
happened
well
before
the
hurricane
struck
because
many
of
those
communities
there
were
so
many
young
men
in
prison
so
many
kids
dropping
out
so
little
hope
hope
gap
hope
gap
that
still
pervades
too
many
communities
all
across
the
country
and
right
here
in
alabama
so
the
question
is
then
what
are
we
the
joshua
generation
doing
to
close
those
gaps
are
we
doing
every
single
thing
that
we
can
do
in
congress
in
order
to
make
sure
that
early
education
is
adequately
funded
and
making
sure
that
we
are
raising
the
minimum
wage
so
people
can
have
dignity
and
respect
are
we
ensuring
that
if
somebody
loses
job
that
they
getting
retrained
and
that
if
they
lost
their
health
care
and
pension
somebody
is
there
to
help
them
get
back
on
their
feet
are
we
making
sure
we
giving
second
chance
to
those
who
have
strayed
and
gone
to
prison
but
want
to
start
new
life
government
alone
solve
all
those
problems
but
government
can
help
it
the
responsibility
of
the
joshua
generation
to
make
sure
that
we
have
government
that
is
as
responsive
as
the
need
that
exists
all
across
america
that
brings
me
to
one
other
point
about
the
joshua
generation
and
that
is
this
that
it
not
enough
just
to
ask
what
the
government
can
do
for
us
it
important
for
us
to
ask
what
we
can
do
for
ourselves
one
of
the
signature
aspects
of
the
civil
rights
movement
was
the
degree
of
discipline
and
fortitude
that
was
instilled
in
all
the
people
who
participated
imagine
young
people
backs
straight
eyes
clear
suit
and
tie
sitting
down
at
lunch
counter
knowing
somebody
is
going
to
spill
milk
on
you
but
you
have
the
discipline
to
understand
that
you
are
not
going
to
retaliate
because
in
showing
the
world
how
disciplined
we
were
as
people
we
were
able
to
win
over
the
conscience
of
the
nation
say
for
certain
that
we
have
instilled
that
same
sense
of
moral
clarity
and
purpose
in
this
generation
bishop
sometimes
feel
like
we
lost
it
little
bit
fighting
to
make
sure
that
our
schools
are
adequately
funded
all
across
the
country
with
the
inequities
of
relying
on
property
taxes
and
people
who
are
born
in
wealthy
districts
getting
better
schools
than
folks
born
in
poor
districts
and
that
now
how
it
supposed
to
be
that
not
the
american
way
but
tell
you
what
even
as
fight
on
behalf
of
more
education
funding
more
equity
have
to
also
say
that
if
parents
do
turn
off
the
television
set
when
the
child
comes
home
from
school
and
make
sure
they
sit
down
and
do
their
homework
and
go
talk
to
the
teachers
and
find
out
how
they
doing
and
if
we
do
start
instilling
sense
in
our
young
children
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
about
in
educational
achievement
do
know
who
taught
them
that
reading
and
writing
and
conjugating
your
verbs
was
something
white
we
got
to
get
over
that
mentality
that
is
part
of
what
the
moses
generation
teaches
us
not
saying
to
ourselves
we
do
something
but
telling
ourselves
that
we
can
achieve
we
can
do
that
we
got
power
in
our
hands
folks
are
complaining
about
the
quality
of
our
government
understand
there
something
to
be
complaining
about
in
washington
see
what
going
on
see
those
powers
and
principalities
have
back
in
there
that
they
writing
the
energy
bills
and
the
drug
laws
we
understand
that
but
tell
you
what
also
know
that
if
cousin
would
vote
get
off
the
couch
and
register
some
folks
and
go
to
the
polls
we
might
have
different
kind
of
politics
that
what
the
moses
generation
teaches
us
take
off
your
bedroom
slippers
put
on
your
marching
shoes
go
do
some
politics
change
this
country
that
what
we
need
we
have
too
many
children
in
poverty
in
this
country
and
everybody
should
be
ashamed
but
do
tell
me
it
does
have
little
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we
got
too
many
daddies
not
acting
like
daddies
do
think
that
fatherhood
ends
at
conception
know
something
about
that
because
my
father
was
around
when
was
young
and
struggled
those
of
you
who
read
my
book
know
went
through
some
difficult
times
know
what
it
means
when
you
do
have
strong
male
figure
in
the
house
which
is
why
the
hardest
thing
about
me
being
in
politics
sometimes
is
not
being
home
as
much
as
like
and
just
blessed
that
got
such
wonderful
wife
at
home
to
hold
things
together
do
tell
me
that
we
do
better
by
our
children
that
we
take
more
responsibility
for
making
sure
we
instilling
in
them
the
values
and
the
ideals
that
the
moses
generation
taught
us
about
sacrifice
and
dignity
and
honesty
and
hard
work
and
discipline
and
that
comes
from
us
we
got
to
transmit
that
to
the
next
generation
and
guess
the
point
that
making
is
that
the
civil
rights
movement
was
just
fight
against
the
oppressor
it
was
also
fight
against
the
oppressor
in
each
of
us
sometimes
it
easy
to
just
point
at
somebody
else
and
say
it
their
fault
but
oppression
has
way
of
creeping
into
it
reverend
it
has
way
of
stunting
yourself
you
start
telling
yourself
bishop
do
something
read
go
to
college
start
business
run
for
congress
run
for
the
presidency
people
start
telling
you
you
do
something
after
while
you
start
believing
it
and
part
of
what
the
civil
rights
movement
was
about
was
that
we
have
to
transform
ourselves
in
order
to
transform
the
world
mahatma
gandhi
great
hero
of
king
and
the
person
who
helped
create
the
nonviolent
movement
around
the
world
he
once
said
that
you
change
the
world
if
you
have
changed
if
you
want
to
change
the
world
the
change
has
to
happen
with
you
first
and
that
is
something
that
the
greatest
and
most
of
generations
has
taught
us
but
the
final
thing
that
think
the
moses
generation
teaches
us
is
to
remind
ourselves
that
we
do
what
we
do
because
god
is
with
us
you
know
when
moses
was
first
called
to
lead
people
out
of
the
promised
land
he
said
do
think
can
do
it
lord
do
speak
like
reverend
do
feel
brave
and
courageous
and
the
lord
said
will
be
with
you
throw
down
that
rod
pick
it
back
up
show
you
what
to
do
the
same
thing
happened
with
the
joshua
generation
joshua
said
you
know
scared
not
sure
that
am
up
to
the
challenge
the
lord
said
to
him
every
place
that
the
sole
of
your
foot
will
tread
upon
have
given
you
be
strong
and
have
courage
for
am
with
you
wherever
you
go
be
strong
and
have
courage
it
prayer
for
journey
prayer
that
kept
woman
in
her
seat
when
the
bus
driver
told
her
to
get
up
prayer
that
led
nine
children
through
the
doors
of
the
little
rock
school
prayer
that
carried
our
brothers
and
sisters
over
bridge
right
here
in
alabama
be
strong
and
have
courage
when
you
see
row
and
row
of
state
trooper
facing
you
the
horses
and
the
tear
gas
how
else
can
you
walk
towards
them
unarmed
unafraid
when
they
come
start
beating
your
friends
and
how
else
can
you
simply
kneel
down
bow
your
head
and
ask
the
lord
for
salvation
when
you
see
heads
gashed
open
and
eyes
burning
and
children
lying
hurt
on
the
side
of
the
road
when
you
are
john
and
you
been
beaten
within
an
inch
of
your
life
on
sunday
how
do
you
wake
up
monday
and
keep
on
marching
be
strong
and
have
courage
for
am
with
you
wherever
you
go
we
come
long
way
in
this
journey
but
we
still
have
long
way
to
travel
we
because
god
was
with
us
it
not
how
far
we
come
that
bridge
outside
was
crossed
by
blacks
and
whites
northerners
and
southerners
teenagers
and
children
the
beloved
community
of
god
children
they
wanted
to
take
those
steps
together
but
it
was
left
to
the
joshua
to
finish
the
journey
moses
had
begun
and
today
we
called
to
be
the
joshua
of
our
time
to
be
the
generation
that
finds
our
way
across
this
river
there
will
be
days
when
the
water
seems
wide
and
the
journey
too
far
but
in
those
moments
we
must
remember
that
throughout
our
history
there
has
been
running
thread
of
ideals
that
have
guided
our
travels
and
pushed
us
forward
even
when
they
just
beyond
our
reach
liberty
in
the
face
of
tyranny
opportunity
where
there
was
none
and
hope
over
the
most
crushing
despair
those
ideals
and
values
beckon
us
still
and
when
we
have
our
doubts
and
our
fears
just
like
joshua
did
when
the
road
looks
too
long
and
it
seems
like
we
may
lose
our
way
remember
what
these
people
did
on
that
bridge
keep
in
your
heart
the
prayer
of
that
journey
the
prayer
that
god
gave
to
joshua
be
strong
and
have
courage
in
the
face
of
injustice
be
strong
and
have
courage
in
the
face
of
prejudice
and
hatred
in
the
face
of
joblessness
and
helplessness
and
hopelessness
be
strong
and
have
courage
brothers
and
sisters
those
who
are
gathered
here
today
in
the
face
of
our
doubts
and
fears
in
the
face
of
in
the
face
of
cynicism
in
the
face
of
mighty
river
be
strong
and
have
courage
and
let
us
cross
over
that
promised
land
together
thank
you
so
much
everybody
god
bless
you
hello
look
at
all
of
you
look
at
all
of
you
goodness
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
so
much
giving
all
praise
and
to
god
for
bringing
us
here
today
thank
you
so
much
am
am
so
grateful
to
see
all
of
you
you
guys
are
still
cheering
back
there
to
audience
on
left
let
me
let
me
begin
by
saying
thanks
to
all
you
who
from
far
and
wide
to
brave
the
cold
today
know
it
little
chilly
but
fired
up
you
know
we
all
made
this
journey
for
reason
it
humbling
to
see
crowd
like
this
but
in
my
heart
know
you
did
just
come
here
for
me
you
came
here
because
you
believe
in
what
this
country
can
be
in
the
face
of
war
you
believe
there
can
be
peace
in
the
face
of
despair
you
believe
there
can
be
hope
in
the
face
of
politics
that
shut
you
out
that
told
you
to
settle
that
divided
us
for
too
long
you
believe
that
we
can
be
one
people
reaching
for
what
possible
building
that
more
perfect
union
that
the
journey
we
on
today
but
let
me
tell
you
how
came
to
be
here
as
most
of
you
know
not
native
of
this
great
state
moved
to
illinois
over
two
decades
ago
was
young
man
then
just
year
out
of
college
knew
no
one
in
chicago
when
arrived
was
without
money
or
family
connections
but
group
of
churches
had
offered
me
job
as
community
for
the
grand
sum
of
dollars
year
and
accepted
the
job
sight
unseen
motivated
then
by
single
simple
powerful
idea
that
might
play
small
part
in
building
better
america
my
work
took
me
to
some
of
chicago
poorest
joined
with
pastors
and
to
deal
with
communities
that
had
been
ravaged
by
plant
closings
saw
that
the
problems
people
faced
were
simply
local
in
nature
that
the
decisions
to
close
steel
mill
was
made
by
distant
executives
that
the
lack
of
textbooks
and
computers
in
school
could
be
traced
to
skewed
priorities
of
politicians
thousand
miles
away
and
that
when
child
turns
to
violence
came
to
that
there
hole
in
that
boy
heart
that
no
government
alone
can
fill
it
was
in
these
that
received
the
best
education
that
ever
had
and
where
learned
the
meaning
of
my
christian
faith
after
three
years
of
this
work
went
to
law
school
because
wanted
to
understand
how
the
law
should
work
for
those
in
need
became
civil
rights
lawyer
and
taught
constitutional
law
and
after
time
came
to
understand
that
our
cherished
rights
of
liberty
and
equality
depend
on
the
active
participation
of
an
awakened
electorate
it
was
with
these
ideas
in
mind
that
arrived
in
this
capital
city
as
state
senator
it
it
was
here
in
where
saw
all
that
is
america
converge
farmers
and
teachers
businessmen
and
all
of
them
with
story
to
tell
all
of
them
seeking
seat
at
the
table
all
of
them
to
be
heard
made
lasting
friendships
here
friends
that
see
here
in
the
audience
today
it
was
here
it
was
here
where
we
learned
to
disagree
without
being
disagreeable
that
it
possible
to
compromise
so
long
as
you
know
those
principles
that
can
never
be
compromised
and
that
so
long
as
we
willing
to
listen
to
each
other
we
can
assume
the
best
in
people
instead
of
the
worst
that
why
we
were
able
to
reform
death
penalty
system
that
was
broken
that
why
we
were
able
to
give
health
insurance
to
children
in
need
that
why
we
made
the
tax
system
right
here
in
more
fair
and
just
for
working
families
and
that
why
we
passed
ethics
reform
that
the
cynics
said
could
never
ever
be
passed
it
was
here
in
where
north
south
east
and
west
come
together
that
was
reminded
of
the
essential
decency
of
the
american
people
where
came
to
believe
that
through
this
decency
we
can
build
more
hopeful
america
and
that
is
why
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
state
capitol
where
lincoln
once
called
on
house
divided
to
stand
together
where
common
hopes
and
common
dreams
still
live
stand
before
you
today
to
announce
my
candidacy
for
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
now
now
listen
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
to
audience
chanting
look
that
there
is
certain
presumptuousness
in
this
certain
audacity
to
this
announcement
know
that
have
spent
lot
of
time
learning
the
ways
of
washington
but
been
there
long
enough
to
know
that
the
ways
of
washington
must
change
the
genius
of
our
founders
is
that
they
designed
system
of
government
that
can
be
changed
and
we
should
take
heart
because
we
changed
this
country
before
in
the
face
of
tyranny
band
of
patriots
brought
an
empire
to
its
knees
in
the
face
of
secession
we
unified
nation
and
set
the
captives
free
in
the
face
of
depression
we
put
people
back
to
work
and
lifted
millions
out
of
poverty
we
welcomed
immigrants
to
our
shores
we
opened
to
the
west
we
landed
man
on
the
moon
and
we
heard
king
call
to
let
justice
roll
down
like
waters
and
righteousness
like
mighty
stream
we
done
this
before
each
and
every
time
new
generation
has
risen
up
and
done
what
needed
to
be
done
today
we
are
called
once
more
and
it
is
time
for
our
generation
to
answer
that
call
for
that
is
our
unyielding
faith
that
in
in
the
face
of
impossible
odds
people
who
love
their
country
can
change
it
that
what
abraham
lincoln
understood
he
had
his
doubts
he
had
his
defeats
he
had
his
he
had
his
setbacks
but
through
his
will
and
his
words
he
moved
nation
and
helped
free
people
it
because
of
the
millions
who
rallied
to
his
cause
that
we
no
longer
divided
north
and
south
slave
and
free
it
because
men
and
women
of
every
race
from
every
walk
of
life
continued
to
march
for
freedom
long
after
lincoln
was
laid
to
rest
that
today
we
have
the
chance
to
face
the
challenges
of
this
millennium
together
as
one
people
as
americans
all
of
us
know
what
those
challenges
are
today
war
with
no
end
dependence
on
oil
that
threatens
our
future
schools
where
too
many
children
are
learning
and
families
struggling
to
despite
working
as
hard
as
they
can
we
know
the
challenges
we
heard
them
we
talked
about
them
for
years
what
stopped
us
from
meeting
these
challenges
is
not
the
absence
of
sound
policies
and
sensible
plans
what
stopped
us
is
the
failure
of
leadership
the
smallness
the
smallness
of
our
politics
the
ease
with
which
we
distracted
by
the
petty
and
trivial
our
chronic
avoidance
of
tough
decisions
our
preference
for
scoring
cheap
political
points
instead
of
rolling
up
our
sleeves
and
building
working
consensus
to
tackle
the
big
problems
of
america
for
the
past
six
years
we
been
told
that
our
mounting
debts
do
matter
we
been
told
that
the
anxiety
americans
feel
about
rising
health
care
costs
and
stagnant
wages
are
an
illusion
we
been
told
that
climate
change
is
hoax
we
been
told
that
tough
talk
and
an
war
can
replace
diplomacy
and
strategy
and
foresight
and
when
all
else
fails
when
happens
or
the
death
toll
in
iraq
mounts
we
been
told
that
our
crises
are
somebody
else
fault
we
distracted
from
our
real
failures
and
told
to
blame
the
other
party
or
gay
people
or
immigrants
and
as
people
have
looked
away
in
disillusionment
and
frustration
we
know
what
filled
the
void
the
cynics
the
lobbyists
the
special
interests
who
turned
our
government
into
game
only
they
can
afford
to
play
they
write
the
checks
and
you
get
stuck
with
the
bill
they
get
the
access
while
you
get
to
write
letter
they
think
they
own
this
government
but
we
here
today
to
take
it
back
the
time
for
that
kind
of
politics
is
over
it
is
through
it
time
to
turn
the
page
right
here
and
right
now
now
look
audience
chants
okay
alright
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
look
look
we
have
made
some
progress
already
was
proud
to
help
lead
the
fight
in
congress
that
led
to
the
most
sweeping
ethics
reforms
since
but
washington
has
long
way
to
go
and
it
be
easy
that
why
we
have
to
set
priorities
we
have
to
make
hard
choices
and
although
government
will
play
crucial
role
in
bringing
about
the
changes
that
we
need
more
money
and
programs
alone
will
not
get
us
to
where
we
need
to
go
each
of
us
in
our
own
lives
will
have
to
accept
responsibility
for
instilling
an
ethic
of
achievement
in
our
children
for
adapting
to
more
competitive
economy
for
strengthening
our
communities
and
sharing
some
measure
of
sacrifice
so
let
us
begin
let
us
begin
this
hard
work
together
let
us
transform
this
nation
let
us
be
the
generation
that
reshapes
our
economy
to
compete
in
the
digital
age
let
set
high
standards
for
our
schools
and
give
them
the
resources
they
need
to
succeed
let
recruit
new
army
of
teachers
and
give
them
better
pay
and
more
support
in
exchange
for
more
accountability
let
make
college
more
affordable
and
let
invest
in
scientific
research
and
let
lay
down
broadband
lines
through
the
heart
of
inner
cities
and
rural
towns
all
across
america
we
can
do
that
and
as
our
economy
changes
let
be
the
generation
that
ensures
our
nation
workers
are
sharing
in
our
prosperity
let
protect
the
benefits
their
companies
have
promised
let
make
it
possible
for
hardworking
americans
to
save
for
retirement
let
allow
our
unions
and
their
to
lift
up
this
country
again
we
can
do
that
let
be
the
generation
that
ends
poverty
in
america
every
single
person
willing
to
work
should
be
able
to
get
job
training
that
leads
to
job
and
earn
living
wage
that
can
pay
the
bills
and
afford
child
care
so
their
kids
can
have
safe
place
to
go
when
they
work
we
can
do
this
and
let
be
the
generation
that
finally
after
all
these
years
tackles
our
health
care
crisis
we
can
control
costs
by
focusing
on
prevention
by
providing
better
treatment
to
the
chronically
ill
and
using
technology
to
cut
the
bureaucracy
let
be
the
generation
that
says
right
here
right
now
we
will
have
universal
health
care
in
america
by
the
end
of
the
next
president
first
term
we
can
do
that
let
be
the
generation
that
finally
frees
america
from
the
tyranny
of
oil
we
can
harness
alternative
fuels
like
ethanol
and
spur
the
production
of
more
cars
we
can
set
up
system
for
capping
greenhouse
gases
we
can
turn
this
crisis
of
global
warming
into
moment
of
opportunity
for
innovation
and
job
creation
and
an
incentive
for
businesses
that
will
serve
as
model
for
the
world
let
be
the
generation
that
makes
future
generations
proud
of
what
we
did
here
most
of
all
let
be
the
generation
that
never
forgets
what
happened
on
that
september
day
and
confront
the
terrorists
with
everything
we
got
politics
does
have
to
divide
us
on
this
anymore
we
can
work
together
to
keep
our
country
safe
worked
with
the
republican
senator
to
pass
law
that
will
secure
and
destroy
some
of
the
world
deadliest
weapons
we
can
work
together
to
track
down
terrorists
with
stronger
military
we
can
tighten
the
net
around
their
finances
we
can
improve
our
intelligence
capabilities
and
finally
get
homeland
security
right
but
let
also
understand
that
ultimate
victory
against
our
enemies
will
only
come
by
rebuilding
our
alliances
and
exporting
those
ideals
that
bring
hope
and
opportunity
to
millions
of
people
around
the
globe
we
can
do
those
things
but
all
of
this
can
not
come
to
pass
until
we
bring
an
end
to
this
war
in
iraq
most
of
you
know
most
of
you
know
that
opposed
this
war
from
the
start
thought
it
was
tragic
mistake
today
we
grieve
for
the
families
who
have
lost
loved
ones
the
hearts
that
have
been
broken
and
the
young
lives
that
could
have
been
america
it
is
time
to
start
bringing
our
troops
home
it
time
it
time
to
admit
that
no
amount
of
american
lives
can
resolve
the
political
disagreement
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
someone
else
civil
war
that
why
have
plan
that
will
bring
our
combat
troops
home
by
march
of
let
the
iraqis
know
letting
the
iraqis
know
that
we
will
not
be
there
forever
is
our
last
best
hope
to
pressure
the
and
to
come
to
the
table
and
find
peace
and
there
one
other
thing
that
it
not
too
late
to
get
right
about
this
war
and
that
is
the
homecoming
of
the
men
and
women
our
veterans
who
have
sacrificed
the
most
let
us
their
courage
by
providing
the
care
they
need
and
rebuilding
the
military
they
love
let
us
be
the
generation
that
begins
that
work
know
there
are
those
who
do
believe
we
can
do
all
these
things
understand
the
after
all
every
four
years
candidates
from
both
parties
make
similar
promises
and
expect
this
year
will
be
no
different
all
of
us
running
for
president
will
travel
around
the
country
offering
plans
and
making
grand
speeches
all
of
us
will
trumpet
those
qualities
we
believe
make
us
uniquely
qualified
to
lead
this
country
but
too
many
times
after
the
election
is
over
and
the
confetti
is
swept
away
all
those
promises
fade
from
memory
and
the
lobbyists
and
special
interests
move
in
and
people
turn
away
disappointed
as
before
left
to
struggle
on
their
own
that
why
this
campaign
only
be
about
me
it
must
be
about
us
it
must
be
about
what
we
can
do
together
this
campaign
must
be
the
occasion
the
vehicle
of
your
hopes
and
your
dreams
it
will
take
your
time
your
energy
and
your
advice
to
push
us
forward
when
we
doing
right
and
let
us
know
when
we
not
this
campaign
has
to
be
about
reclaiming
the
meaning
of
citizenship
restoring
our
sense
of
common
purpose
and
that
few
obstacles
can
withstand
the
power
of
millions
of
voices
calling
for
change
by
ourselves
this
change
will
not
happen
divided
we
are
bound
to
fail
but
the
life
of
tall
gangly
lawyer
tells
us
that
different
future
is
possible
he
tells
us
that
there
is
power
in
words
he
tells
us
that
there
power
in
conviction
that
beneath
all
the
differences
of
race
and
region
faith
and
station
we
are
one
people
he
tells
us
that
there
power
in
hope
as
lincoln
the
forces
arrayed
against
slavery
he
was
heard
to
say
this
of
strange
discordant
and
even
hostile
elements
we
gathered
from
the
four
winds
and
formed
and
fought
to
battle
through
that
is
our
purpose
here
today
that
is
why
am
in
this
race
not
just
to
hold
an
office
but
to
gather
with
you
to
transform
nation
want
want
to
win
that
next
battle
for
justice
and
opportunity
want
to
win
that
next
battle
for
better
schools
and
better
jobs
and
better
health
care
for
all
want
us
to
take
up
the
unfinished
business
of
perfecting
our
union
and
building
better
america
and
if
you
will
join
with
me
in
this
improbable
quest
if
you
feel
destiny
calling
and
see
as
see
the
future
of
endless
possibility
stretching
out
before
us
if
you
sense
as
sense
that
the
time
is
now
to
shake
off
our
slumber
and
slough
off
our
fears
and
make
good
on
the
debt
we
owe
past
and
future
generations
then
am
ready
to
take
up
the
cause
and
march
with
you
and
work
with
you
today
together
we
can
finish
the
work
that
needs
to
be
done
and
usher
in
new
birth
of
freedom
on
this
earth
thank
you
very
much
everybody
let
get
to
work
love
you
thank
you
as
many
of
you
know
over
the
last
few
months
been
thinking
hard
about
my
plans
for
running
for
the
presidency
is
profound
decision
decision
no
one
should
make
on
the
basis
of
media
hype
or
personal
ambition
alone
and
so
before
committed
myself
and
my
family
to
this
race
wanted
to
be
sure
that
this
was
right
for
us
and
more
importantly
right
for
the
country
certainly
did
expect
to
find
myself
in
this
position
year
ago
but
as
spoken
to
many
of
you
in
my
travels
across
the
states
these
past
months
as
read
your
and
read
your
letters
been
struck
by
how
hungry
we
all
are
for
different
kind
of
politics
so
spent
some
time
thinking
about
how
could
best
advance
the
cause
of
change
and
progress
that
we
so
desperately
need
the
decisions
that
have
been
made
in
washington
these
past
six
years
and
the
problems
that
have
been
ignored
have
put
our
country
in
precarious
place
our
economy
is
changing
rapidly
and
that
means
profound
changes
for
working
people
many
of
you
have
shared
with
me
your
stories
about
health
care
bills
the
pensions
you
lost
and
your
struggles
to
pay
for
college
for
your
kids
our
continued
dependence
on
oil
has
put
our
security
and
our
very
planet
at
risk
and
we
still
mired
in
tragic
and
costly
war
that
should
have
never
been
waged
but
challenging
as
they
are
it
not
the
magnitude
of
our
problems
that
concerns
me
the
most
it
the
smallness
of
our
politics
america
faced
big
problems
before
but
today
our
leaders
in
washington
seem
incapable
of
working
together
in
practical
common
sense
way
politics
has
become
so
bitter
and
partisan
so
gummed
up
by
money
and
influence
that
we
tackle
the
big
problems
that
demand
solutions
and
that
what
we
have
to
change
first
we
have
to
change
our
politics
and
come
together
around
our
common
interests
and
concerns
as
americans
this
happen
by
itself
change
in
our
politics
can
only
come
from
you
from
people
across
our
country
who
believe
there
better
way
and
are
willing
to
work
for
it
years
ago
as
community
in
chicago
learned
that
meaningful
change
always
begins
at
the
grassroots
and
that
engaged
citizens
working
together
can
accomplish
extraordinary
things
so
even
in
the
midst
of
the
enormous
challenges
we
face
today
have
great
faith
and
hope
about
the
future
because
believe
in
you
and
that
why
wanted
to
tell
you
first
that
be
filing
papers
today
to
create
presidential
exploratory
committee
for
the
next
several
weeks
going
to
talk
with
people
from
around
the
country
listening
and
learning
more
about
the
challenges
we
face
as
nation
the
opportunities
that
lie
before
us
and
the
role
that
presidential
campaign
might
play
in
bringing
our
country
together
and
on
february
at
the
end
of
these
discussions
and
in
my
home
state
of
illinois
share
my
plans
with
my
friends
and
fellow
americans
in
the
meantime
want
to
thank
all
of
you
for
your
time
your
suggestions
your
encouragement
and
your
prayers
and
look
forward
to
continuing
our
conversation
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
thank
you
lee
for
hosting
me
here
at
the
and
for
your
leadership
of
both
the
commission
and
the
iraq
study
group
you
have
been
steady
voice
of
reason
in
an
unsteady
time
let
me
also
say
that
my
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
your
colleague
and
her
family
have
made
my
position
known
to
the
iranian
government
it
is
time
for
to
be
released
it
is
time
for
to
come
home
thanks
to
the
commission
we
know
that
six
years
ago
this
week
president
bush
received
briefing
with
the
headline
determined
to
strike
in
it
came
during
what
the
commission
called
the
of
threat
when
the
was
blinking
about
an
impending
attack
but
despite
the
briefing
many
felt
the
danger
was
overseas
threat
to
embassies
and
military
installations
the
extremism
the
resentment
the
terrorist
training
camps
and
the
killers
were
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
world
far
away
from
the
american
homeland
then
one
bright
and
beautiful
tuesday
morning
they
were
here
was
driving
to
state
legislative
hearing
in
chicago
when
heard
the
news
on
my
car
radio
plane
had
hit
the
by
the
time
got
to
my
meeting
the
second
plane
had
hit
and
we
were
told
to
evacuate
people
gathered
in
the
streets
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
the
sears
tower
transformed
from
workplace
to
target
we
feared
for
our
families
and
our
country
we
mourned
the
terrible
loss
suffered
by
our
fellow
citizens
back
at
my
law
office
watched
the
images
from
new
york
plane
vanishing
into
glass
and
steel
men
and
women
clinging
to
then
letting
go
tall
towers
crumbling
to
dust
it
seemed
all
of
the
misery
and
all
of
the
evil
in
the
world
were
in
that
rolling
black
cloud
blocking
out
the
september
sun
what
we
saw
that
morning
forced
us
to
that
in
new
world
of
threats
we
are
no
longer
protected
by
our
own
power
and
what
we
saw
that
morning
was
challenge
to
new
generation
the
history
of
one
of
tragedy
turned
into
triumph
and
so
war
over
secession
became
an
opportunity
to
set
the
captives
free
an
attack
on
pearl
led
to
wave
of
freedom
rolling
across
the
pacific
an
iron
curtain
was
punctured
by
democratic
values
new
institutions
at
home
and
strong
international
partnerships
abroad
after
our
calling
was
to
write
new
chapter
in
the
american
story
to
devise
new
strategies
and
build
new
alliances
to
secure
our
homeland
and
safeguard
our
values
and
to
serve
just
cause
abroad
we
were
ready
americans
were
united
friends
around
the
world
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
us
we
had
the
might
and
that
was
the
legacy
of
generations
of
americans
the
tide
of
history
seemed
poised
to
turn
once
again
toward
hope
but
then
everything
changed
we
did
not
finish
the
job
against
in
we
did
not
develop
new
capabilities
to
defeat
new
enemy
or
launch
comprehensive
strategy
to
dry
up
the
base
of
support
we
did
not
reaffirm
our
basic
values
or
secure
our
homeland
instead
we
got
politics
of
fear
patriotism
as
the
possession
of
one
political
party
the
diplomacy
of
refusing
to
talk
to
other
countries
rigid
century
ideology
that
insisted
that
the
stateless
terrorism
could
be
defeated
through
the
invasion
and
occupation
of
state
deliberate
strategy
to
misrepresent
to
sell
war
against
country
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
and
so
little
more
than
year
after
that
bright
september
day
was
in
the
streets
of
this
time
speaking
at
rally
in
opposition
to
war
in
iraq
did
not
oppose
all
wars
said
was
strong
supporter
of
the
war
in
but
said
could
not
support
dumb
war
rash
in
iraq
worried
about
occupation
of
undetermined
length
at
undetermined
cost
with
undetermined
in
the
heart
of
the
muslim
world
pleaded
that
we
the
fight
with
bin
and
the
political
winds
were
blowing
in
different
direction
the
president
was
determined
to
go
to
war
there
was
just
one
obstacle
the
congress
nine
days
after
spoke
that
obstacle
was
removed
congress
the
rush
to
war
giving
the
president
the
broad
and
authority
he
uses
to
this
day
with
that
vote
congress
became
of
catastrophic
war
and
we
went
off
to
fight
on
the
wrong
battlefield
with
no
appreciation
of
how
many
enemies
we
would
create
and
no
plan
for
how
to
get
out
because
of
war
in
iraq
that
should
never
have
been
and
should
never
have
been
waged
we
are
now
less
safe
than
we
were
before
according
to
the
national
intelligence
estimate
the
threat
to
our
homeland
from
is
and
iraqis
training
ground
for
terror
torn
apart
by
civil
war
is
more
violent
than
it
has
been
since
has
sanctuary
in
pakistan
israel
is
besieged
by
emboldened
enemies
talking
openly
of
its
destruction
now
presenting
the
broadest
strategic
challenge
to
the
united
states
in
the
middle
east
in
generation
groups
affiliated
with
or
inspired
by
operate
worldwide
six
years
after
we
are
again
in
the
midst
of
of
threat
with
bin
and
many
more
terrorists
determined
to
strike
in
states
more
in
the
dark
halls
of
and
the
detention
cells
we
have
compromised
our
most
precious
values
what
could
have
been
call
to
generation
has
become
an
excuse
for
unchecked
presidential
power
tragedy
that
united
us
was
turned
into
political
wedge
issue
used
to
divide
us
it
is
time
to
turn
the
page
it
is
time
to
write
new
chapter
in
our
response
to
just
because
the
president
misrepresents
our
enemies
does
not
mean
we
do
not
have
them
the
terrorists
are
at
war
with
us
the
threat
is
from
violent
extremists
who
are
small
minority
of
the
billion
muslims
but
the
threat
is
real
they
distort
islam
they
kill
man
woman
and
child
christian
and
hindu
jew
and
muslim
they
seek
to
create
repressive
to
defeat
this
enemy
we
must
understand
who
we
are
fighting
against
and
what
we
are
fighting
for
the
president
would
have
us
believe
that
every
bomb
in
part
of
war
against
us
not
an
iraqi
civil
war
he
elevates
in
iraq
which
exist
before
our
invasion
and
overlooks
the
people
who
hit
us
on
who
are
training
new
recruits
he
lumps
together
groups
with
very
different
goals
and
iran
militias
and
insurgents
he
confuses
our
mission
and
worse
he
is
fighting
the
war
the
terrorists
want
us
to
fight
bin
and
his
allies
know
they
can
not
defeat
us
on
the
field
of
battle
or
in
genuine
battle
of
ideas
but
they
can
provoke
the
reaction
seen
in
iraq
misguided
invasion
of
muslim
country
that
sparks
new
ties
down
our
military
busts
our
budgets
increases
the
pool
of
terrorist
recruits
alienates
america
gives
democracy
bad
name
and
prompts
the
american
people
to
question
our
engagement
in
the
world
by
refusing
to
end
the
war
in
iraq
president
bush
is
giving
the
terrorists
what
they
really
want
and
what
the
congress
voted
to
give
them
in
occupation
of
undetermined
length
at
undetermined
cost
with
undetermined
consequences
it
is
time
to
turn
the
page
when
am
president
we
will
wage
the
war
that
has
to
be
won
with
comprehensive
strategy
with
five
elements
getting
out
of
iraq
and
on
to
the
right
battlefield
in
and
pakistan
developing
the
capabilities
and
partnerships
we
need
to
take
out
the
terrorists
and
the
most
deadly
weapons
engaging
the
world
to
dry
up
support
for
terror
and
extremism
restoring
our
values
and
securing
more
resilient
homeland
the
first
step
must
be
getting
off
the
wrong
battlefield
in
iraq
and
taking
the
fight
to
the
terrorists
in
and
pakistan
introduced
plan
in
january
that
would
have
already
started
bringing
our
troops
out
of
iraq
with
goal
of
removing
all
combat
brigades
by
march
if
the
president
continues
to
veto
this
plan
then
ending
this
war
will
be
my
first
priority
when
take
office
there
is
no
military
solution
in
iraq
only
leaders
can
settle
the
grievances
at
the
heart
of
civil
war
we
must
apply
pressure
on
them
to
act
and
our
best
leverage
is
reducing
our
troop
presence
and
we
must
also
do
the
hard
and
sustained
diplomatic
work
in
the
region
on
behalf
of
peace
and
stability
in
ending
the
war
we
must
act
with
more
wisdom
than
we
started
it
that
is
why
my
plan
would
maintain
sufficient
forces
in
the
region
to
target
within
iraq
but
we
must
that
is
not
the
primary
source
of
violence
in
iraq
and
has
little
support
not
from
and
who
has
targeted
or
tribes
hostile
to
foreigners
on
the
contrary
appeal
within
iraq
is
enhanced
by
our
troop
presence
ending
the
war
will
help
isolate
and
give
iraqis
the
incentive
and
opportunity
to
take
them
out
it
will
also
allow
us
to
direct
badly
needed
resources
to
our
troops
have
fought
valiantly
there
but
iraq
has
deprived
them
of
the
support
they
deserve
as
result
parts
of
are
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
and
mix
of
terrorism
drugs
and
corruption
threatens
to
overwhelm
the
country
as
president
would
deploy
at
least
two
additional
brigades
to
our
operations
and
support
efforts
against
the
as
we
step
up
our
commitment
our
european
friends
must
do
the
same
and
without
the
burdensome
restrictions
that
have
hampered
efforts
we
must
also
put
more
of
an
afghan
face
on
security
by
improving
the
training
and
equipping
of
the
afghan
army
and
police
and
including
afghan
soldiers
in
and
nato
operations
we
must
not
however
repeat
the
mistakes
of
iraq
the
solution
in
is
not
just
military
it
is
political
and
economic
as
president
would
increase
our
aid
by
billion
these
resources
should
fund
projects
at
the
local
level
to
impact
ordinary
afghans
including
the
development
of
alternative
livelihoods
for
poppy
farmers
and
we
must
seek
better
performance
from
the
afghan
government
and
support
that
performance
through
tough
safeguards
on
aid
and
increased
international
support
to
develop
the
rule
of
law
across
the
country
above
all
will
send
clear
message
we
will
not
repeat
the
mistake
of
the
past
when
we
turned
our
back
on
following
soviet
withdrawal
as
showed
us
the
security
of
and
america
is
shared
and
today
that
security
is
most
threatened
by
the
and
sanctuary
in
the
tribal
regions
of
terrorists
train
travel
and
maintain
global
communications
in
this
the
pursues
hit
and
run
strategy
striking
in
then
skulking
across
the
border
to
safety
this
is
the
wild
frontier
of
our
world
there
are
deserts
and
mountains
there
are
tribes
that
see
borders
as
nothing
more
than
lines
on
map
and
governments
as
forces
that
come
and
go
there
are
blood
ties
deeper
than
alliances
of
convenience
and
pockets
of
extremism
that
follow
religion
to
violence
tough
place
but
that
is
no
excuse
there
must
be
no
for
terrorists
who
threaten
america
we
can
not
fail
to
act
because
action
is
hard
as
president
would
make
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
military
aid
to
pakistan
conditional
and
would
make
our
conditions
clear
make
substantial
progress
in
closing
down
the
training
camps
evicting
foreign
fighters
and
preventing
the
from
using
pakistan
as
staging
area
for
attacks
understand
that
president
has
his
own
challenges
but
let
me
make
this
clear
there
are
terrorists
holed
up
in
those
mountains
who
murdered
americans
they
are
plotting
to
strike
again
it
was
terrible
mistake
to
fail
to
act
when
we
had
chance
to
take
out
an
leadership
meeting
in
if
we
have
actionable
intelligence
about
terrorist
targets
and
president
act
we
will
and
pakistan
needs
more
than
to
combat
extremism
as
the
government
increases
investment
in
secular
education
to
counter
radical
my
administration
will
increase
commitment
we
must
invest
in
the
provinces
along
the
afghan
border
so
that
the
program
of
hate
is
met
with
one
of
hope
and
we
must
not
turn
blind
eye
to
elections
that
are
neither
free
nor
fair
our
goal
is
not
simply
an
ally
in
pakistan
it
is
democratic
ally
there
is
core
of
terrorists
probably
in
the
tens
of
thousands
who
have
made
their
choice
to
attack
america
so
the
second
step
in
my
strategy
will
be
to
build
our
capacity
and
our
partnerships
to
track
down
capture
or
kill
terrorists
around
the
world
and
to
deny
them
the
most
dangerous
weapons
will
not
hesitate
to
use
military
force
to
take
out
terrorists
who
pose
direct
threat
to
america
this
requires
broader
set
of
capabilities
as
outlined
in
the
army
and
marine
new
manual
will
ensure
that
our
military
becomes
more
stealth
agile
and
lethal
in
its
ability
to
capture
or
kill
terrorists
we
need
to
recruit
train
and
equip
our
armed
forces
to
better
target
terrorists
and
to
help
foreign
to
do
the
same
this
must
include
program
to
bolster
our
ability
to
speak
different
languages
understand
different
cultures
and
coordinate
complex
missions
with
our
civilian
agencies
to
succeed
we
must
improve
our
civilian
capacity
the
finest
military
in
the
world
is
adapting
to
the
challenges
of
the
century
but
it
can
not
counter
insurgent
and
terrorist
threats
without
civilian
counterparts
who
can
carry
out
economic
and
political
reconstruction
missions
sometimes
in
dangerous
places
as
president
will
strengthen
these
civilian
capacities
recruiting
our
best
and
brightest
to
take
on
this
challenge
will
increase
both
the
numbers
and
capabilities
of
our
diplomats
development
experts
and
other
civilians
who
can
work
alongside
our
military
we
just
say
there
is
no
military
solution
to
these
problems
we
need
to
integrate
all
aspects
of
american
might
one
component
of
this
integrated
approach
will
be
new
mobile
development
teams
that
bring
together
personnel
from
the
state
department
the
pentagon
and
these
teams
will
work
with
civil
society
and
local
governments
to
make
an
immediate
impact
in
lives
and
to
turn
the
tide
against
extremism
where
people
are
most
vulnerable
where
the
light
of
hope
has
grown
dark
and
where
we
are
in
position
to
make
real
difference
in
advancing
security
and
opportunity
that
is
where
these
teams
will
go
will
also
strengthen
our
intelligence
this
is
about
more
than
an
chart
we
need
leadership
that
forces
our
agencies
to
share
information
and
leadership
that
never
ever
twists
the
facts
to
support
bad
policies
but
we
must
also
build
our
capacity
to
better
collect
and
information
and
to
carry
out
operations
to
disrupt
terrorist
plots
and
break
up
terrorist
networks
this
can
not
just
be
an
american
mission
and
its
allies
operate
in
nearly
countries
the
united
states
can
not
steal
every
secret
penetrate
every
cell
act
on
every
tip
or
track
down
every
terrorist
nor
should
we
have
to
do
this
alone
this
is
not
just
about
our
security
it
is
about
the
common
security
of
all
the
world
as
president
will
create
shared
security
partnership
program
to
forge
an
international
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
infrastructure
to
take
down
terrorist
networks
from
the
remote
islands
to
the
sprawling
cities
of
africa
this
program
will
provide
billion
over
three
years
for
cooperation
with
countries
around
the
world
including
information
sharing
funding
for
training
operations
border
security
programs
technology
and
targeting
terrorist
financing
and
this
effort
will
focus
on
helping
our
partners
succeed
without
repressive
tactics
because
brutality
breeds
terror
it
does
not
defeat
it
we
must
also
do
more
to
safeguard
the
most
dangerous
weapons
we
know
seeks
nuclear
weapon
we
know
they
would
not
hesitate
to
use
one
yet
there
is
still
about
tons
of
highly
enriched
uranium
some
of
it
poorly
secured
at
civilian
nuclear
facilities
in
over
forty
countries
there
are
still
about
to
nuclear
weapons
and
stockpiles
of
uranium
and
plutonium
scattered
across
time
zones
in
the
former
soviet
union
that
is
why
worked
in
the
senate
with
to
pass
law
that
would
help
the
united
our
allies
detect
and
stop
the
smuggling
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
that
is
why
am
introducing
bill
with
chuck
that
seeks
to
prevent
nuclear
terrorism
reduce
global
nuclear
arsenals
and
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
that
is
why
as
president
will
lead
global
effort
to
secure
all
nuclear
weapons
and
material
at
vulnerable
sites
within
four
years
while
we
work
to
secure
existing
stockpiles
we
should
also
negotiate
verifiable
global
ban
on
the
production
of
new
nuclear
weapons
material
and
hesitate
to
use
the
power
of
american
diplomacy
to
stop
countries
from
obtaining
these
weapons
or
sponsoring
terror
the
lesson
of
the
bush
years
is
that
not
talking
does
not
work
go
down
the
list
of
countries
ignored
and
see
how
successful
that
strategy
has
been
we
talked
to
iran
and
they
continue
to
build
their
nuclear
program
we
talked
to
syria
and
they
continue
support
for
terror
we
tried
not
talking
to
north
korea
and
they
now
have
enough
material
for
to
more
nuclear
weapons
time
to
turn
the
page
on
the
diplomacy
of
tough
talk
and
no
action
time
to
turn
the
page
on
conventional
wisdom
that
agreement
must
be
reached
before
you
meet
that
talking
to
other
countries
is
some
kind
of
reward
and
that
presidents
can
only
meet
with
people
who
will
tell
them
what
they
want
to
hear
president
kennedy
said
it
best
us
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
but
let
us
never
fear
to
only
by
knowing
your
adversary
can
you
defeat
them
or
drive
wedges
between
them
as
president
will
work
with
our
friend
and
allies
but
our
diplomacy
in
to
the
or
our
diplomacy
to
the
chinese
will
do
the
careful
preparation
needed
and
let
these
countries
know
stands
they
will
no
longer
have
the
excuse
of
american
intransigence
they
will
have
our
terms
no
support
for
terror
and
no
nuclear
weapons
but
america
must
be
about
more
than
taking
out
terrorists
and
locking
up
weapons
or
else
new
terrorists
will
rise
up
to
take
the
place
of
every
one
we
capture
or
kill
that
is
why
the
third
step
in
my
strategy
will
be
drying
up
the
rising
well
of
support
for
extremism
when
you
travel
to
the
trouble
spots
as
united
states
senator
much
of
what
you
see
is
from
helicopter
so
you
look
out
with
the
buzz
of
the
rotor
in
your
ear
maybe
door
gunner
nearby
and
you
see
the
refugee
camp
in
the
flood
near
the
bombed
out
block
in
baghdad
you
see
thousands
of
desperate
faces
new
recruits
come
from
africa
and
asia
the
middle
europe
many
come
from
disaffected
communities
and
disconnected
corners
of
our
interconnected
world
and
it
makes
you
stop
and
wonder
when
those
faces
look
up
at
an
american
helicopter
do
they
feel
hope
or
do
they
feel
hate
we
know
where
extremists
thrive
in
conflict
zones
that
are
incubators
of
resentment
and
anarchy
in
weak
states
that
can
not
control
their
borders
or
territory
or
meet
the
basic
needs
of
their
people
from
central
asia
to
the
pacific
nearly
countries
stand
on
the
brink
of
conflict
or
collapse
the
extremists
encourage
the
exploitation
of
these
hopeless
places
on
their
and
we
know
what
the
extremists
say
about
us
america
is
just
an
occupying
army
in
muslim
lands
the
shadow
of
shrouded
figure
standing
on
box
at
the
power
behind
the
throne
of
repressive
leader
they
say
we
are
at
war
with
islam
that
is
the
whispered
line
of
the
extremist
who
has
nothing
to
offer
in
this
battle
of
ideas
but
blame
blame
progress
blame
jews
and
often
he
offers
something
along
with
the
hate
sense
of
empowerment
maybe
an
education
at
some
charity
for
your
family
some
basic
services
in
the
and
then
mission
and
gun
we
know
we
are
not
who
they
say
we
are
america
is
at
war
with
terrorists
who
killed
on
our
soil
we
are
not
at
war
with
islam
compassionate
nation
that
wants
better
future
for
all
people
the
vast
majority
of
the
billion
muslims
have
no
use
for
bin
or
his
bankrupt
ideas
but
too
often
since
the
extremists
have
defined
us
not
the
other
way
around
when
am
president
that
will
change
we
will
author
our
own
story
we
do
need
to
stand
for
democracy
and
will
but
democracy
is
about
more
than
ballot
box
show
through
deeds
as
well
as
words
that
we
stand
with
those
who
seek
better
life
that
child
looking
up
at
the
helicopter
must
see
america
and
feel
hope
as
president
will
make
it
focus
of
my
foreign
policy
to
roll
back
the
tide
of
hopelessness
that
gives
rise
to
hate
freedom
must
mean
freedom
from
fear
not
the
freedom
of
anarchy
will
never
shrug
my
shoulders
and
say
as
secretary
did
is
will
focus
our
support
on
helping
nations
build
independent
judicial
systems
honest
police
forces
and
financial
systems
that
are
transparent
and
accountable
freedom
must
also
mean
freedom
from
want
not
freedom
lost
to
an
empty
stomach
so
will
make
poverty
reduction
key
part
of
helping
other
nations
reduce
anarchy
will
double
our
annual
investments
to
meet
these
challenges
to
billion
by
and
will
support
billion
global
education
fund
to
counter
the
radical
often
funded
by
money
from
within
saudi
that
have
filled
young
minds
with
messages
of
hate
we
must
work
for
world
where
every
child
everywhere
is
taught
to
build
and
not
to
destroy
and
as
we
lead
we
will
ask
for
more
from
our
friends
in
europe
and
asia
as
well
more
support
for
our
diplomacy
more
support
for
multilateral
peacekeeping
and
more
support
to
rebuild
societies
ravaged
by
conflict
will
also
launch
program
of
public
diplomacy
that
is
coordinated
effort
across
my
administration
not
small
group
of
political
officials
at
the
state
department
explaining
misguided
war
we
will
open
in
cities
across
the
islamic
world
with
internet
libraries
english
lessons
stories
of
muslims
and
the
strength
they
add
to
our
country
and
vocational
programs
through
new
voice
we
will
recruit
train
and
send
out
into
the
field
talented
young
americans
who
can
speak
with
and
listen
to
the
people
who
today
hear
about
us
only
from
our
enemies
as
president
will
lead
this
effort
in
the
first
days
of
my
administration
will
travel
to
major
islamic
forum
and
deliver
an
address
to
redefine
our
struggle
will
make
clear
that
we
are
not
at
war
with
islam
that
we
will
stand
with
those
who
are
willing
to
stand
up
for
their
future
and
that
we
need
their
effort
to
defeat
the
prophets
of
hate
and
violence
will
speak
directly
to
that
child
who
looks
up
at
that
helicopter
and
my
message
will
be
clear
matter
to
us
your
future
is
our
future
and
our
moment
is
this
brings
me
to
the
fourth
step
in
my
strategy
will
make
clear
that
the
days
of
compromising
our
values
are
over
major
general
paul
had
long
and
distinguished
career
serving
this
country
it
included
training
the
iraqi
army
after
his
senior
iraqi
came
into
his
office
and
said
have
no
idea
how
this
will
play
out
on
the
streets
of
baghdad
and
the
rest
of
the
arab
world
how
can
this
be
this
was
not
the
america
he
had
looked
up
to
as
the
manual
reminds
us
we
can
not
win
war
unless
we
maintain
the
high
ground
and
keep
the
people
on
our
side
but
because
the
administration
decided
to
take
the
low
road
our
troops
have
more
enemies
because
the
administration
cast
aside
international
norms
that
reflect
american
values
we
are
less
able
to
promote
our
values
when
am
president
america
will
reject
torture
without
is
the
country
that
stood
against
that
kind
of
and
we
will
do
so
again
also
will
reject
legal
framework
that
does
not
work
there
has
been
only
one
conviction
at
it
was
for
guilty
plea
on
material
support
for
terrorism
the
sentence
was
months
there
has
not
been
one
conviction
of
terrorist
act
have
faith
in
courts
and
have
faith
in
our
as
president
will
close
reject
the
military
commissions
act
and
adhere
to
the
geneva
conventions
our
constitution
and
our
uniform
code
of
military
justice
provide
framework
for
dealing
with
the
terrorists
this
administration
also
puts
forward
false
choice
between
the
liberties
we
cherish
and
the
security
we
demand
will
provide
our
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
agencies
with
the
tools
they
need
to
track
and
take
out
the
terrorists
without
undermining
our
constitution
and
our
freedom
that
means
no
more
illegal
of
american
citizens
no
more
national
security
letters
to
spy
on
citizens
who
are
not
suspected
of
crime
no
more
tracking
citizens
who
do
nothing
more

protest
misguided
war
no
more
ignoring
the
law
when
it
is
inconvenient
that
is
not
who
we
are
and
it
is
not
what
is
necessary
to
defeat
the
terrorists
the
court
works
the
separation
of
powers
works
our
constitution
works
we
will
again
set
an
example
for
the
world
that
the
law
is
not
subject
to
the
whims
of
stubborn
rulers
and
that
justice
is
not
arbitrary
this
administration
acts
like
violating
civil
liberties
is
the
way
to
enhance
our
security
it
is
not
there
are
no
to
protecting

and
that
is
why
the
fifth
part
of
my
strategy
is
doing
the
hard
and
patient
work
to
secure
more
resilient
homeland
too
often
this
approach
to
homeland
security
has
been
to
scatter
money
around
and
avoid
hard
choices
or
to
scare
americans
without
telling
them
what
to
be
scared
of
or
what
to
do
department
set
up
to
make
americans
feel
safer
even
show
up
when
bodies
drifted
through
the
streets
in
new
not
acceptable
my
administration
will
take
an
approach
to
homeland
security
guided
by
risk
will
establish
review
at
the
department
of
homeland
security
just
like
at
the
pentagon
to
undertake
top
to
bottom
review
of
the
threats
we
face
and
our
ability
to
confront
them
and
will
develop
comprehensive
national
infrastructure
protection
plan
that
draws
on
both
local
and
national
priorities
we
have
to
put
resources
where
our
infrastructure
is
most
vulnerable
that
means
tough
and
permanent
standards
for
securing
our
chemical
plants
improving
our
capability
to
screen
cargo
and
investing
in
safeguards
that
will
prevent
the
disruption
of
our
ports
and
making
sure
our
energy
sector
our
refineries
and
pipelines
and
power
grids
is
protected
so
that
terrorists
can
not
cripple
our
economy
we
also
have
to
get
past
approach
folks
across
america
are
the
ones
on
the
front
lines
on
it
was
citizens
empowered
by
their
knowledge
of
trade
attacks
who
protected
our
government
by
heroically
taking
action
on
flight
to
keep
it
from
reaching
our
capital
when
have
information
that
can
empower
americans
will
share
it
with
them
information
sharing
with
state
and
local
governments
must
be
street
because
we
never
know
where
the
two
pieces
of
the
puzzle
are
that
might
fit
together
the
tip
from
and
the
cop
who
sees
something
suspicious
on
michigan
avenue
will
increase
funding
to
help
train
police
to
gather
information
and
connect
it
to
the
intelligence
they
receive
from
the
federal
government
will
address
the
problem
in
our
prisons
where
the
most
disaffected
and
disconnected
americans
are
being
explicitly
targeted
for
conversion
by
and
its
ideological
allies
and
my
administration
will
not
permit
more
lives
to
be
lost
because
emergency
responders
are
not
with
the
communications
capability
and
protective
equipment
their
job
requires
or
because
the
federal
government
is
too
slow
to
respond
when
disaster
strikes
been
through
that
on
been
through
it
during
will
ensure
that
we
have
the
resources
and
competent
federal
leadership
we
need
to
support
our
communities
when
american
lives
are
at
stake
but
this
effort
just
be
about
what
we
ask
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
it
just
be
about
how
we
spend
our
time
or
our
money
about
the
kind
of
country
we
are
we
are
in
the
early
stages
of
long
struggle
yet
since
heard
lot
about
what
do
or
do
or
even
try
we
vote
against
misguided
war
because
that
would
make
us
look
weak
or
talk
to
other
countries
because
that
would
be
reward
we
reach
out
to
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
muslims
who
reject
terror
because
we
worry
they
hate
us
we
protect
the
homeland
because
there
are
too
many
targets
or
secure
our
people
while
staying
true
to
our
values
we
get
past
the
america
of
red
and
blue
the
politics
of
up
and
down
that
is
not
the
know
know
is
the
last
best
hope
for
that
child
looking
up
at
helicopter
the
country
that
put
man
on
the
moon
that
defeated
fascism
and
helped
country
whose
strength
abroad
is
measured
not
just
by
armies
but
rather
by
the
power
of
our
ideals
and
by
our
purpose
to
forge
an
ever
more
perfect
union
at
home
the
know
we
just
have
to
act
like
it
again
to
write
that
next
chapter
in
the
american
story
if
we
do
we
can
keep
while
extending
security
and
opportunity
around
the
world
we
can
hold
true
to
our
values
and
in
doing
so
advance
those
values
abroad
and
we
can
be
what
that
child
looking
up
at
helicopter
needs
us
to
be
the
relentless
opponent
of
terror
and
tyranny
and
the
light
of
hope
to
the
world
to
make
this
story
reality
going
to
take
americans
coming
together
and
changing
the
fundamental
direction
of
this
country
going
to
take
the
service
of
new
generation
of
young
people
going
to
take
facing
tragedy
and
turning
it
into
the
next
triumph
that
is
challenge
that
welcome
because
when
we
do
make
that
change
do
more
than
win
war
live
up
to
that
calling
to
make
america
and
the
world
safer
freer
and
more
hopeful
than
we
found
it
president
rise
today
both
humbled
and
by
the
opportunity
to
express
my
support
for
renewal
of
the
expiring
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
want
to
thank
the
many
people
inside
and
outside
congress
who
have
worked
so
hard
over
the
past
year
to
get
us
here
we
owe
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
leadership
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
and
we
owe
special
thanks
to
chairmen
and
ranking
members
and
and
representative
watt
without
their
work
and
dedication
and
the
support
of
voting
rights
advocates
across
the
country
doubt
that
this
bill
would
have
come
before
us
so
soon
want
to
thank
both
chambers
and
both
sides
of
the
aisle
as
well
for
getting
this
done
with
the
same
broad
support
that
drove
the
original
act
years
ago
at
time
when
americans
are
frustrated
with
the
partisan
bickering
that
too
often
stalls
our
work
the
refreshing
display
of
we
seeing
today
reflects
our
collective
belief
in
the
success
of
the
act
and
reminds
us
of
how
effective
we
can
be
when
we
work
together
nobody
can
deny
that
we
come
long
way
since
look
at
the
registration
numbers
only
two
years
after
the
passage
of
the
original
act
registration
numbers
for
minority
voters
in
some
states
doubled
soon
after
not
single
state
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
had
registered
less
than
half
of
its
minority
voting
age
population
look
at
the
influence
of
elected
officials
at
every
single
level
of
government
there
are
members
of
congress
since
our
nation
top
has
been
african
american
in
fact
most
of
america
elected
officials
come
from
states
covered
by
section
of
the
voting
rights
act
states
like
and
alabama
and
georgia
but
to
me
the
most
striking
evidence
of
our
progress
can
be
found
right
across
this
building
in
my
dear
friend
congressman
john
who
was
on
the
front
lines
of
the
civil
rights
movement
risking
life
and
limb
for
freedom
and
on
march
he
led
peaceful
protesters
demanding
the
right
to
vote
across
the
bridge
in
alabama
now
often
thought
about
the
people
on
the
bridge
that
day
not
only
john
and
who
led
the
march
but
the
hundreds
of
everyday
americans
who
left
their
homes
and
their
churches
to
join
it
blacks
and
whites
teenagers
children
teachers
bankers
shopkeepers
what
king
called
beloved
community
of
god
children
ready
to
stand
for
freedom
and
wonder
sometimes
where
did
they
find
that
kind
of
courage
you
know
when
you
facing
row
after
row
of
state
troopers
on
horseback
armed
with
billy
clubs
and
tear
gas
when
they
coming
toward
you
spewing
hatred
and
violence
how
do
you
simply
stop
kneel
down
and
pray
to
the
lord
for
salvation
but
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
is
that
after
that
day
after
john
was
beaten
within
an
inch
of
his
life
after
people
heads
were
gashed
open
and
their
eyes
were
burned
and
they
watched
their
children
innocence
literally
beaten
out
of
them
after
all
that
they
went
back
and
marched
again
they
marched
again
they
crossed
the
bridge
they
awakened
nation
conscience
and
not
five
months
later
the
voting
rights
act
of
was
signed
into
law
it
was
in
in
and
now
in
john
the
physical
scars
of
those
marches
still
visible
is
an
original
of
the
fourth
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
he
was
joined
last
week
by
of
his
house
colleagues
in
voting
for
its
passage
there
were
some
in
the
house
and
there
may
be
some
in
the
senate
who
argue
that
the
act
is
no
longer
needed
that
the
protections
of
section
requirement
requirement
that
ensures
certain
states
are
upholding
the
right
to
vote
are
targeting
the
wrong
states
unfortunately
the
evidence
refutes
that
notion
of
the
objections
issued
by
the
department
of
justice
since
percent
occurred
since
the
last
in
over
half
have
occurred
since
so
despite
the
progress
these
states
have
made
in
upholding
the
right
to
vote
it
clear
that
problems
still
exist
now
there
are
others
who
would
argue
that
we
should
renew
section
protection
of
language
minorities
these
arguments
have
been
tied
to
debates
over
immigration
and
they
tend
to
muddle
issue
protecting
the
right
to
vote
with
one
of
today
most
contentious
debates
but
let
remember
you
request
language
assistance
if
you
not
voter
and
you
be
voter
if
you
are
not
citizen
and
while
voters
as
citizens
must
be
proficient
in
english
many
are
simply
more
confident
that
they
can
cast
ballots
printed
in
their
native
languages
without
making
errors
it
not
an
unreasonable
assumption
representative
of
the
voter
registration
project
is
quoted
as
saying
quote
citizens
who
prefer
spanish
registration
cards
do
so
because
they
feel
more
connected
to
the
process
they
also
feel
they
trust
the
process
more
when
they
fully
understand
these
sentiments
connection
to
and
trust
in
our
democratic
process
are
exactly
what
we
want
from
our
voting
rights
legislation
our
challenges
of
course
do
end
at
the
voting
rights
act
we
have
to
prevent
the
problems
we
seen
in
recent
elections
from
happening
again
we
seen
political
operatives
purge
voters
from
registration
rolls
for
no
legitimate
reason
prevent
eligible
from
casting
ballots
distribute
polling
equipment
unevenly
and
deceive
voters
about
the
time
location
and
rules
of
elections
and
unfortunately
these
efforts
have
been
directed
primarily
at
minority
voters
the
disabled
individuals
and
other
historically
disenfranchised
groups
the
help
america
vote
act
or
was
big
step
in
the
right
direction
but
we
got
to
do
more
we
need
to
fully
fund
if
we
going
to
move
forward
in
the
next
stage
of
securing
the
right
to
vote
for
every
citizen
we
need
to
enforce
critical
requirements
like
registration
databases
we
need
to
make
sure
polling
equipment
is
distributed
equitably
and
equipment
actually
works
and
we
need
to
work
on
getting
more
people
to
the
polls
on
election
day
we
need
to
make
sure
that
minority
voters
are
not
the
subject
of
some
deplorable
intimidation
tactics
when
they
do
go
to
the
polls
you
know
in
native
american
voters
in
south
were
confronted
by
men
posing
as
law
enforcement
these
hired
joked
about
jail
time
for
ballot
missteps
and
followed
voters
to
their
cars
to
record
their
license
plates
in
lake
county
ohio
some
voters
received
memo
on
bogus
board
of
election
letterhead
informing
voters
who
registered
through
democratic
and
drives
that
they
could
not
vote
in
flier
purporting
to
be
from
the
black
voters
league
was
circulated
in
predominantly
with
the
following
message
if
you
already
voted
in
any
election
this
year
you
vote
in
the
presidential
election
if
you
violate
any
of
these
laws
you
can
get
ten
years
in
prison
and
your
children
will
get
taken
away
from
you
now
think
about
that
we
got
lot
more
work
to
do
this
occasion
is
cause
for
celebration
but
it
also
an
opportunity
to
renew
our
commitment
to
voting
rights
as
congressman
said
last
week
it
clear
that
we
come
great
distance
but
we
still
have
great
distance
to
now
the
memory
of
still
lives
on
in
the
spirit
of
the
voting
rights
act
since
that
day
the
voting
rights
act
has
been
critical
tool
in
ensuring
that
all
americans
not
only
have
the
right
to
vote
but
have
the
right
to
have
their
vote
counted
and
those
of
us
concerned
about
protecting
those
rights
afford
to
sit
on
our
laurels
upon
of
this
bill
we
need
to
take
advantage
of
this
rare
united
front
and
continue
to
fight
to
ensure
unimpeded
access
to
the
polls
of
all
americans
in
other
words
we
need
to
take
the
spirit
that
existed
on
that
bridge
and
we
have
to
spread
it
across
this
country
you
know
two
weeks
after
the
first
march
was
turned
back
king
spoke
and
he
told
gathering
of
and
activists
and
community
members
he
said
that
they
should
not
despair
because
the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
is
long
but
it
bends
toward
justice
the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
is
long
but
it
bends
toward
justice
that
because
of
the
work
that
each
of
us
do
that
it
bends
toward
justice
it
because
of
people
like
john
and
and
king
and
parks
all
the
giants
upon
whose
shoulders
we
stand
that
we
are
beneficiaries
of
that
arc
bending
toward
justice
that
why
stand
here
today
would
not
be
in
the
united
states
senate
had
it
not
been
for
the
efforts
and
courage
of
so
many
parents
and
grandparents
and
ordinary
people
who
were
willing
to
reach
up
and
bend
that
arc
in
the
direction
of
justice
hope
we
continue
to
see
that
spirit
live
on
not
just
during
this
debate
but
throughout
all
our
work
here
in
the
senate
thank
you
president
yield
the
floor
thank
you
very
much
president
today
we
mourn
the
passing
of
king
and
when
think
about
king
think
about
the
little
girl
who
walked
five
miles
to
school
on
those
rural
alabama
roads
and
felt
the
heat
of
racism
each
day
she
passed
the
door
of
the
school
so
much
closer
to
home
it
did
matter
because
she
studied
and
succeeded
and
excelled
beyond
most
of
her
classmates
black
and
white
she
earned
college
degree
and
an
acceptance
to
prestigious
graduate
school
up
north
and
one
day
she
met
young
preacher
from
atlanta
and
she
fell
in
love
with
him
and
he
told
her
his
dreams
and
she
believed
in
those
dreams
and
she
decided
that
she
would
help
to
make
them
real
not
just
as
wife
or
as
friend
but
as
partner
in
freedom
cause
over
the
next
years
king
did
that
in
so
many
ways
we
even
imagine
she
raised
family
she
marched
through
the
streets
she
inspired
through
song
she
led
through
even
dodged
the
countless
attempts
on
her
family
life
and
one
of
when
one
of
those
attempts
finally
took
her
love
from
this
world
she
made
the
selfless
decision
to
carry
on
with
no
time
to
even
cry
or
mourn
to
wallow
in
anger
or
vengeance
king
took
to
the
streets
just
four
days
after
the
assassination
and
led
through
the
streets
of
memphis
in
march
for
the
kind
of
justice
that
her
husband
had
given
his
life
for
she
spent
the
rest
of
here
marching
for
that
same
justice
leading
the
king
for
nonviolent
social
change
in
atlanta
and
spreading
her
family
message
of
hope
to
every
corner
of
this
world
you
know
had
the
great
of
of
knowing
king
and
the
occasion
to
visit
with
her
in
atlanta
last
year
she
was
an
extraordinarily
gracious
woman
we
sat
and
chatted
in
her
living
room
we
she
showed
me
an
album
of
photographs
of
her
and
king
and
the
children
and
then
she
told
me
what
her
husband
had
said
to
her
once
at
time
when
she
was
feeling
burdened
understandably
by
all
the
stress
and
strain
that
had
been
placed
on
the
family
as
consequence
of
his
role
in
the
civil
rights
movement
she
said
her
husband
suggested
that
when
you
are
willing
to
make
sacrifices
for
great
cause
you
will
never
be
alone
because
you
will
have
divine
companionship
and
the
support
of
good
people
that
was
her
husband
advice
to
her
that
when
you
are
willing
to
make
sacrifices
for
great
cause
you
will
never
be
alone
king
died
in
her
sleep
last
night
she
certainly
was
not
alone
she
was
joined
by
the
companionship
and
support
of
loving
family
and
grateful
nation
inspired
by
her
cause
dedicated
to
her
work
and
mournful
of
her
passing
my
thoughts
condolences
today
are
with
her
children
and
ask
that
she
and
her
husband
now
rest
together
in
eternal
peace
thank
you
very
much
president
you
know
four
years
ago
following
the
most
devastating
attack
in
our
history
this
body
passed
the
patriot
act
in
order
to
give
our
nation
law
enforcement
the
tools
they
needed
to
track
down
terrorists
who
plot
and
lurk
within
our
own
borders
and
all
over
the
world
terrorists
who
right
now
are
looking
to
exploit
weaknesses
in
our
laws
and
our
security
to
carry
out
attacks
that
may
be
even
deadlier
than
those
that
took
place
on
september
we
all
agree
that
we
need
legislation
to
make
it
harder
for
suspected
terrorists
to
go
undetected
in
this
country
and
we
all
agree
that
we
needed
to
make
it
harder
for
them
to
and
and
get
flight
licenses
and
sneak
across
our
borders
americans
everywhere
wanted
to
do
that
but
soon
after
the
patriot
act
passed
few
years
before
even
arrived
here
in
the
senate
began
hearing
concerns
from
people
of
every
background
and
political
leaning
that
this
law
the
very
purpose
of
which
was
to
protect
us
was
also
threatening
to
violate
some
of
the
rights
and
freedoms
that
we
hold
most
dear
that
it
did
just
provide
law
enforcement
the
powers
it
needed
to
keep
us
safe
but
powers
that
it
did
need
to
invade
our
privacy
without
cause
or
suspicion
now
in
washington
this
issue
has
tended
to
degenerate
into
the
typical
debate
either
we
protect
our
people
from
terror
or
we
protect
our
most
cherished
principles
would
suggest
president
that
this
is
false
choice
it
asks
too
little
of
us
and
it
assumes
too
little
about
america
that
why
as
it
come
to
time
to
the
patriot
act
we
been
working
in
bipartisan
way
to
do
both
to
show
american
people
that
we
can
track
down
terrorists
without
trampling
on
our
civil
liberties
to
show
the
american
people
that
the
federal
government
will
only
issue
warrants
and
execute
searches
because
it
needs
to
do
so
not
because
it
can
do
so
what
we
have
been
trying
to
achieve
under
the
leadership
of
bipartisan
group
of
senators
is
some
accountability
in
this
process
to
get
answers
and
see
evidence
where
there
is
suspicion
several
weeks
ago
these
efforts
bore
fruit
the
judiciary
committee
and
the
senate
managed
to
pass
piece
of
bipartisan
legislation
that
while
say
is
perfect
was
able
to
address
some
of
the
most
serious
problems
in
the
existing
law
unfortunately
that
strong
bipartisan
legislation
has
been
tossed
aside
in
conference
instead
we
been
forced
to
consider
piece
of
rushed
legislation
that
fails
to
address
the
concerns
of
members
of
both
parties
as
well
as
the
american
people
this
is
legislation
that
puts
our
own
justice
department
above
the
law
when
national
security
letters
are
issued
they
allow
federal
agents
to
conduct
any
search
on
any
american
no
matter
how
extensive
how
wide
ranging
without
ever
going
before
judge
to
prove
that
the
search
is
necessary
all
that
is
needed
is
from
local
agent
that
it
once
business
or
person
receives
notification
that
they
will
be
searched
they
are
prohibited
from
telling
anyone
about
it
and
they
even
prohibited
from
challenging
this
automatic
gag
order
in
court
even
though
judges
have
already
found
that
similar
restrictions
violate
the
first
amendment
this
conference
report
disregards
the
case
law
and
the
right
to
challenge
the
gag
order
if
you
do
decide
to
consult
an
attorney
for
legal
advice
hold
on
you
will
have
to
tell
the
that
you
done
so
think
about
that
you
want
to
talk
to
lawyer
about
whether
or
not
your
actions
are
going
to
be
causing
you
to
get
into
trouble
you
got
to
tell
the
that
you
consulting
lawyer
this
is
unheard
of
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
any
other
area
of
the
law
see
no
reason
why
it
justified
here
and
if
someone
wants
to
know
why
their
own
government
has
decided
to
go
on
fishing
expedition
through
every
personal
record
or
private
document
through
the
library
books
that
you
read
the
phone
calls
that
you
made
the
that
you
sent
this
legislation
gives
people
no
rights
to
appeal
the
need
for
such
search
in
court
of
law
no
judge
will
hear
your
plea
no
jury
will
hear
your
case
this
is
just
plain
wrong
and
there
are
republican
senators
as
well
as
democratic
senators
that
that
it
plain
wrong
giving
law
enforcement
the
tools
they
need
to
investigate
suspicious
activities
is
one
thing
and
it
the
right
thing
but
doing
it
without
any
real
oversight
seriously
the
rights
of
all
americans
and
the
ideals
america
stands
for
now
supporters
of
this
conference
report
have
argued
we
should
just
hold
our
noses
and
support
this
legislation
because
it
not
going
to
get
any
better
that
is
not
good
argument
we
can
do
better
we
got
time
to
do
better
it
does
convince
me
that
should
support
this
report
believe
we
owe
it
to
the
nation
we
owe
it
to
those
who
fought
for
our
civil
liberties
we
owe
it
to
the
future
and
our
children
to
make
sure
that
we
craft
the
kind
of
legislation
that
would
make
us
proud
not
just
legislation
that
we
would
settle
for
because
we
in
rush
we
do
have
to
settle
for
patriot
act
that
sacrifices
our
liberties
or
our
safety
we
can
have
one
that
secures
both
now
there
have
been
proposals
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
and
in
both
houses
of
congress
to
extend
the
patriot
act
for
three
months
so
that
we
can
reach
an
agreement
on
this
bill
that
is
well
thought
through
support
these
efforts
and
will
oppose
on
what
consider
to
be
this
unacceptable
conference
report
president
thank
you
yield
the
floor
good
morning
president
taylor
board
of
trustees
faculty
parents
family
friends
the
community
of
the
class
of
which
understand
was
out
last
night
and
yet
still
showed
up
here
on
time
and
most
of
all
the
class
of
congratulations
on
your
graduation
and
thank
you
thank
you
for
the
of
allowing
me
to
be
part
of
it
thank
you
also
president
for
this
honorary
degree
it
was
only
couple
of
years
ago
that
stopped
paying
my
student
loans
in
law
school
had
known
it
was
this
easy
would
have
ran
sic
for
the
united
states
senate
earlier
you
know
it
has
been
about
six
months
now
since
you
sent
me
to
washington
as
your
united
states
senator
that
not
all
of
you
voted
for
me
so
for
those
of
you
muttering
under
your
breath
send
you
anywhere
that
ok
too
maybe
hold
what
do
you
call
it
little
after
the
ceremony
change
your
mind
for
the
next
time
it
has
been
fascinating
journey
thus
far
each
time
walk
onto
the
senate
floor
reminded
of
the
history
for
good
and
for
ill
that
has
been
made
there
but
there
have
been
few
surreal
moments
for
example
remember
the
day
before
was
sworn
in
myself
and
my
staff
we
decided
to
hold
press
conference
in
our
office
now
keep
in
mind
that
am
ranked
in
seniority
was
proud
that
ranked
dead
last
until
found
out
that
just
because
illinois
is
bigger
than
so
in
seniority
and
all
the
reporters
are
crammed
into
the
tiny
transition
office
that
have
which
is
right
next
to
the
closet
in
the
basement
of
the
office
building
my
first
day
in
the
building
have
not
taken
single
vote
have
not
introduced
one
bill
had
not
even
sat
down
in
my
desk
and
this
very
earnest
reporter
raises
his
hand
and
says
what
is
your
place
in
history
did
what
you
just
did
which
is
laugh
out
loud
said
place
in
history
thought
he
was
kidding
at
that
point
even
sure
the
other
senators
would
save
place
for
me
at
the
cool
table
but
as
was
thinking
about
the
words
to
share
with
this
class
about
next
about
possible
and
what
opportunities
lay
ahead
actually
think
not
bad
question
for
you
the
class
of
to
ask
yourselves
what
will
be
your
place
in
history
in
other
eras
across
distant
lands
this
question
could
be
answered
with
relative
ease
and
certainty
as
servant
in
rome
you
knew
spend
your
life
forced
to
build
somebody
empire
as
peasant
in
century
china
you
knew
that
no
matter
how
hard
you
worked
the
local
warlord
might
come
and
take
everything
you
had
and
you
also
knew
that
famine
might
come
knocking
at
the
door
as
subject
of
king
george
you
knew
that
your
freedom
of
worship
and
your
freedom
to
speak
and
to
build
your
own
life
would
be
ultimately
limited
by
the
throne
and
then
america
happened
place
where
destiny
was
not
destination
but
journey
to
be
shared
and
shaped
and
remade
by
people
who
had
the
gall
the
temerity
to
believe
that
against
all
odds
they
could
form
more
perfect
on
this
new
frontier
and
as
people
around
the
world
began
to
hear
the
tale
of
the
lowly
colonists
who
overthrew
an
empire
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
they
started
to
come
across
oceans
and
the
ages
they
settled
in
boston
and
chicago
and
louis
and
to
try
and
build
their
own
american
dream
this
collective
dream
moved
forward
imperfectly
it
was
scarred
by
our
treatment
of
native
peoples
betrayed
by
slavery
clouded
by
the
subjugation
of
women
shaken
by
war
and
depression
and
yet
brick
by
brick
rail
by
rail
calloused
hand
by
calloused
hand
people
kept
dreaming
and
building
and
working
and
marching
and
petitioning
their
government
until
they
made
america
land
where
the
question
of
our
place
in
history
is
not
answered
for
us
answered
by
us
have
we
failed
at
times
absolutely
will
you
occasionally
fail
when
you
embark
on
your
own
american
journey
you
surely
will
but
the
test
is
not
perfection
the
true
test
of
the
american
ideal
is
whether
able
to
our
failings
and
then
rise
together
to
meet
the
challenges
of
our
time
whether
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
shaped
by
events
and
history
or
whether
we
act
to
shape
them
whether
chance
of
birth
or
circumstance
decides
big
winners
and
losers
or
whether
we
build
community
where
at
the
very
least
everyone
has
chance
to
work
hard
get
ahead
and
reach
their
dreams
we
have
faced
this
choice
before
at
the
end
of
the
civil
war
when
farmers
and
their
families
began
moving
into
the
cities
to
work
in
the
big
factories
that
were
sprouting
up
all
across
america
we
had
to
decide
do
we
do
nothing
and
allow
captains
of
industry
and
robber
barons
to
run
roughshod
over
the
economy
and
workers
by
competing
to
see
who
can
pay
the
lowest
wages
at
the
worst
working
conditions
or
do
we
try
to
make
the
system
work
by
setting
up
basic
rules
for
the
market
instituting
the
first
public
schools
busting
up
monopolies
letting
workers
into
unions
we
chose
to
act
and
we
rose
together
when
the
irrational
exuberance
of
the
roaring
twenties
came
crashing
down
with
the
stock
market
we
had
to
decide
do
we
follow
the
call
of
leaders
who
would
do
nothing
or
the
call
of
leader
who
perhaps
because
of
his
physical
paralysis
refused
to
accept
political
paralysis
we
chose
to
act
regulating
the
market
putting
people
back
to
work
expanding
bargaining
rights
to
include
health
care
and
secure
retirement
and
together
we
rose
when
world
war
required
the
most
massive
home
front
in
history
and
we
needed
every
single
american
to
lend
hand
we
had
to
decide
do
we
listen
to
who
told
us
it
possible
to
produce
that
many
tanks
and
planes
or
did
we
build
arsenal
for
democracy
and
grow
our
economy
even
further
by
providing
our
returning
with
chance
to
go
to
college
and
own
their
own
home
again
we
chose
to
act
and
again
we
rose
together
today
at
the
beginning
of
this
young
century
we
have
to
decide
again
but
this
time
it
is
your
turn
to
choose
here
in
you
know
what
this
new
challenge
is
seen
it
all
of
you
your
first
year
in
college
saw
what
happened
at
already
been
noted
the
degree
to
which
your
lives
will
be
intertwined
with
the
war
on
terrorism
that
currently
is
taking
place
but
what
also
seen
perhaps
not
as
spectacularly
is
the
fact
that
when
you
drive
by
the
old
plant
around
lunchtime
no
one
walks
out
anymore
saw
it
during
the
campaign
when
met
union
guys
who
worked
at
the
plant
for
years
and
now
wonder
what
do
at
the
age
of
without
pension
or
health
care
when
met
the
man
son
needed
new
liver
but
because
been
laid
off
know
if
he
could
afford
to
provide
his
child
the
care
that
he
needed
as
if
someone
changed
the
rules
in
the
middle
of
the
game
and
no
wonder
no
one
bothered
to
tell
these
folks
and
in
reality
the
rules
have
changed
it
started
with
technology
and
automation
that
rendered
entire
occupations
obsolete
when
was
the
last
time
anybody
here
stood
in
line
for
the
bank
teller
instead
of
going
to
the
or
talked
to
switchboard
operator
then
it
continued
when
companies
like
were
able
to
pick
up
and
move
their
factories
to
some
under
developed
country
where
workers
were
lot
cheaper
than
they
are
in
the
united
states
as
points
out
in
his
new
book
the
world
is
flat
over
the
last
decade
or
so
these
forces
technology
and
have
combined
like
never
before
so
that
while
most
of
us
have
been
paying
attention
to
how
much
easier
technology
has
made
our
own
lives
sending
back
and
forth
on
our
blackberries
surfing
the
web
on
our
cell
phones
instant
messaging
with
friends
across
the
world
quiet
revolution
has
been
breaking
down
barriers
and
connecting
the
economies
now
business
not
only
has
the
ability
to
move
jobs
wherever
factory
but
wherever
an
internet
connection
countries
like
india
and
china
this
they
understand
that
they
no
longer
need
to
be
just
source
of
cheap
or
cheap
exports
they
can
compete
with
us
on
global
scale
the
one
resource
they
needed
were
skilled
educated
workers
so
they
started
schooling
their
kids
earlier
longer
with
greater
emphasis
on
math
and
science
and
technology
until
their
most
talented
students
they
have
to
come
to
america
to
have
decent
life
they
can
stay
right
where
they
are
the
result
china
is
graduating
four
times
the
number
of
engineers
that
the
united
states
is
graduating
not
only
are
those
employees
competing
with
chinese
and
indian
and
and
mexican
workers
you
are
too
today
accounting
firms
are
your
tax
returns
to
workers
in
india
who
will
figure
them
out
and
send
them
back
to
you
as
fast
as
any
worker
in
illinois
or
indiana
could
when
you
lose
your
luggage
in
boston
at
an
airport
tracking
it
down
may
involve
call
to
an
agent
in
who
will
find
it
by
making
phone
call
to
even
the
associated
press
has
some
of
their
jobs
to
writers
all
over
the
world
who
can
send
in
story
at
click
of
mouse
as
prime
minister
tony
has
said
in
this
new
economy
talent
is
the
century
wealth
if
you
got
the
skills
you
got
the
education
and
you
have
the
opportunity
to
upgrade
and
improve
both
be
able
to
compete
and
win
anywhere
if
not
the
fall
will
be
further
and
harder
than
it
ever
was
before
so
what
do
we
do
about
this
how
does
america
find
its
way
in
this
new
global
economy
what
will
our
place
in
history
be
like
so
much
of
the
american
story
once
again
we
face
choice
once
again
there
are
those
who
believe
that
there
much
we
can
do
about
this
as
nation
that
the
best
idea
is
to
give
everyone
one
big
refund
on
their
government
it
up
by
individual
portions
in
the
form
of
tax
breaks
hand
it
out
and
encourage
everyone
to
use
their
share
to
go
buy
their
own
health
care
their
own
retirement
plan
their
own
child
care
their
own
education
and
so
on
in
washington
they
call
this
the
ownership
society
but
in
our
past
there
has
been
another
term
for
it
social
every
man
or
woman
for
him
or
herself
tempting
idea
because
it
require
much
thought
or
ingenuity
it
allows
us
to
say
that
those
whose
health
care
or
tuition
may
rise
faster
than
they
can
afford
tough
luck
it
allows
us
to
say
to
the
workers
who
have
lost
their
job
life
fair
it
us
say
to
the
child
who
was
born
into
poverty
pull
yourself
up
by
your
bootstraps
and
it
is
especially
tempting
because
each
of
us
believes
we
will
always
be
the
winner
in
lottery
that
the
one
who
will
be
the
next
trump
or
at
least
we
be
the
chump
who
trump
says
fired
but
there
is
problem
it
work
it
ignores
our
history
it
ignores
the
fact
that
been
government
research
and
investment
that
made
the
railways
possible
and
the
internet
possible
been
the
creation
of
massive
middle
class
through
decent
wages
and
benefits
and
public
schools
that
allowed
us
all
to
prosper
our
economic
dependence
depended
on
individual
initiative
it
depended
on
belief
in
the
free
market
but
it
has
also
depended
on
our
sense
of
mutual
regard
for
each
other
the
idea
that
everybody
has
stake
in
the
country
that
all
in
it
together
and
got
shot
at
opportunity
produced
our
political
stability
and
so
if
we
do
nothing
in
the
face
of
more
people
will
continue
to
lose
their
health
care
fewer
kids
will
be
able
to
afford
the
diploma
about
to
receive
more
companies
like
united
airlines
be
able
to
provide
pensions
for
their
employees
and
those
workers
will
be
joined
in
the
unemployment
line
by
any
worker
whose
skills
can
be
bought
and
sold
on
the
global
market
so
today
here
to
tell
you
what
most
of
you
already
know
this
is
not
us
the
option
that
just
mentioned
doing
nothing
not
how
our
story
ends
not
in
this
country
america
is
land
of
big
dreamers
and
big
hopes
it
is
this
hope
that
has
sustained
us
through
revolution
and
civil
war
depression
and
world
war
struggle
for
civil
and
social
rights
and
the
brink
of
nuclear
crisis
and
it
is
because
our
dreamers
dreamed
that
we
have
emerged
from
each
challenge
more
united
more
prosperous
and
more
admired
than
before
so
dream
instead
of
doing
nothing
or
simply
defending
century
solutions
imagine
together
what
we
could
do
to
give
every
american
fighting
chance
in
the
century
what
if
we
prepared
every
child
in
america
with
the
education
and
skills
they
need
to
compete
in
the
new
economy
if
we
made
sure
that
college
was
affordable
for
everyone
who
wanted
to
go
if
we
walked
up
to
those
workers
and
we
said
old
job
is
not
coming
back
but
new
job
will
be
there
because
going
to
seriously
retrain
you
and
education
waiting
for
you
the
sorts
of
opportunities
that
has
created
with
the
strong
futures
scholarship
program
what
if
no
matter
where
you
worked
or
how
many
times
you
switched
jobs
you
had
health
care
and
pension
that
stayed
with
you
always
so
you
all
had
the
flexibility
to
move
to
better
job
or
start
new
business
what
if
instead
of
cutting
budgets
for
research
and
development
and
science
we
the
genius
and
the
innovation
that
will
lead
to
the
new
jobs
and
new
industries
of
the
future
right
now
all
across
america
there
are
amazing
discoveries
being
made
if
we
supported
these
discoveries
on
national
level
if
we
committed
ourselves
to
investing
in
these
possibilities
just
imagine
what
it
could
do
for
town
like
ten
or
twenty
years
down
the
road
that
old
plant
could
its
doors
as
an
ethanol
refinery
that
turned
corn
into
fuel
down
the
street
biotechnology
research
lab
could
open
up
on
the
cusp
of
discovering
cure
for
cancer
and
across
the
way
new
auto
company
could
be
busy
churning
out
electric
cars
the
new
jobs
created
would
be
filled
by
american
workers
trained
with
new
skills
and
education
all
of
that
is
possible
but
none
of
it
will
come
easy
every
one
of
us
is
going
to
have
to
work
more
read
more
train
more
think
more
we
will
have
to
slough
off
some
bad
habits
like
driving
gas
guzzlers
that
weaken
our
economy
and
feed
our
enemies
abroad
our
children
will
have
to
turn
off
the
set
once
in
while
and
put
away
the
video
games
and
start
hitting
the
books
have
to
reform
institutions
like
our
public
schools
that
were
designed
for
an
earlier
time
republicans
will
have
to
our
collective
responsibilities
even
as
democrats
that
we
have
to
do
more
than
just
defend
old
programs
it
be
easy
but
it
can
be
done
it
can
be
our
future
we
have
the
talent
and
the
resources
and
brainpower
but
now
we
need
the
political
will
we
need
national
commitment
and
we
need
each
of
you
now
no
one
can
force
you
to
meet
these
challenges
if
you
want
it
will
be
pretty
easy
for
you
to
leave
here
today
and
not
give
another
thought
to
towns
like
and
the
challenges
they
face
there
is
no
community
service
requirement
in
the
real
world
no
one
is
forcing
you
to
care
you
can
take
your
diploma
walk
off
this
stage
and
go
chasing
after
the
big
house
and
the
nice
suits
and
all
the
other
things
that
our
money
culture
says
that
you
should
want
that
you
should
aspire
to
that
you
can
buy
but
hope
you
walk
away
from
the
challenge
focusing
your
life
solely
on
making
buck
shows
certain
poverty
of
ambition
it
asks
too
little
of
yourself
you
need
to
take
up
the
challenges
that
we
face
as
nation
and
make
them
your
own
not
because
you
have
debt
to
those
who
helped
you
get
here
although
you
do
have
that
debt
not
because
you
have
an
obligation
to
those
who
are
less
fortunate
than
you
although
do
think
you
do
have
that
obligation
primarily
because
you
have
an
obligation
to
yourself
because
individual
salvation
has
always
depended
on
collective
salvation
because
only
when
you
hitch
your
wagon
to
something
larger
than
yourself
that
you
your
true
potential
and
know
that
all
of
you
are
wondering
how
do
this
the
challenges
seem
so
big
they
seem
so
difficult
for
one
person
to
make
difference
but
we
know
it
can
be
done
because
where
sitting
in
this
very
place
in
this
town
happened
before
nearly
two
centuries
ago
before
civil
rights
before
voting
rights
before
abraham
lincoln
before
the
civil
war
before
all
of
that
america
was
stained
by
the
sin
of
slavery
in
the
sweltering
heat
of
southern
plantations
men
and
women
who
looked
like
me
could
not
escape
the
life
of
pain
and
servitude
in
which
they
were
sold
and
yet
year
after
year
as
this
moral
cancer
ate
away
at
the
american
ideals
of
liberty
and
equality
the
nation
was
silent
but
its
people
stay
silent
for
long
one
by
one
abolitionists
emerged
to
tell
their
fellow
americans
that
this
would
not
be
our
place
in
history
that
this
was
not
the
america
that
had
captured
the
imagination
of
the
world
this
resistance
that
they
met
was
fierce
and
some
paid
with
their
lives
but
they
would
not
be
deterred
and
they
soon
spread
out
across
the
country
to
fight
for
their
cause
one
man
from
new
york
went
west
all
the
way
to
the
prairies
of
illinois
to
start
colony
and
here
in
freedom
found
home
here
in
the
main
depot
for
the
underground
railroad
in
illinois
escaped
slaves
could
roam
freely
on
the
streets
and
take
shelter
in
homes
and
when
their
masters
or
the
police
would
come
for
them
the
people
of
this
town
would
help
them
escape
north
some
literally
carrying
them
in
their
arms
to
freedom
think
about
the
risks
that
involved
if
they
were
caught
abetting
fugitive
you
been
jailed
or
lynched
it
would
have
been
simple
for
these
townspeople
to
turn
the
other
way
to
go
live
their
lives
in
private
peace
and
yet
they
do
that
why
because
they
knew
that
we
were
all
americans
that
we
were
all
brothers
and
sisters
the
same
reason
that
century
later
young
men
and
women
your
age
would
take
freedom
rides
down
south
to
work
for
the
civil
rights
movement
the
same
reason
that
black
women
would
walk
instead
of
ride
bus
after
long
day
of
doing
somebody
laundry
and
cleaning
somebody
kitchen
because
they
were
marching
for
freedom
today
on
this
day
of
possibility
we
stand
in
the
shadow
of
lanky
man
with
little
formal
education
who
once
took
the
stage
at
old
main
and
told
the
nation
that
if
anyone
did
not
believe
the
american
principles
of
freedom
and
equality
that
those
principles
were
timeless
and
they
should
go
rip
that
page
out
of
the
declaration
of
independence
my
hope
for
all
of
you
is
that
as
you
leave
here
today
you
decide
to
keep
these
principles
alive
in
your
own
life
and
in
the
life
of
this
country
you
will
be
tested
you
always
succeed
but
know
that
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
try
that
generations
who
have
come
before
you
faced
these
same
fears
and
uncertainties
in
their
own
time
and
that
through
our
collective
and
through
providence
and
our
willingness
to
shoulder
each
burdens
america
will
continue
on
its
precious
journey
towards
that
distant
horizon
and
better
day
thank
you
so
much
class
of
and
congratulations
on
your
graduation
thank
you
senator
thank
you
very
much
president
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
senate
have
to
say
that
did
anticipate
speaking
today
but
the
importance
think
of
this
issue
is
one
in
which
feel
it
important
for
me
to
address
this
body
you
know
during
the
election
had
the
occasion
of
meeting
woman
who
had
supported
me
in
my
campaign
and
she
decided
to
come
to
shake
my
hand
and
take
photograph
wonderful
woman
she
was
asking
for
anything
and
was
very
grateful
that
she
took
time
to
come
by
it
was
unexceptional
moment
except
for
the
fact
that
she
was
born
in
and
her
name
was
an
woman
who
had
been
born
in
born
in
the
shadow
of
slavery
born
at
time
when
were
commonplace
born
at
time
when
and
women
could
not
vote
and
yet
over
the
course
of
decades
she
had
participated
in
broadening
our
democracy
and
ensuring
that
in
fact
at
some
point
if
not
herself
then
her
children
and
her
grandchildren
and
her
would
be
in
position
in
which
they
could
too
call
themselves
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
make
certain
that
this
government
works
not
just
on
behalf
of
the
mighty
and
the
powerful
but
also
on
behalf
of
people
like
her
and
so
the
fact
that
she
voted
and
that
her
vote
was
counted
in
this
election
was
of
supreme
importance
to
her
and
it
is
the
memory
of
talking
to
her
and
shaking
her
hand
that
causes
me
to
rise
on
this
occasion
am
absolutely
convinced
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
george
bush
won
this
election
also
believe
that
he
got
more
votes
in
ohio
think
as
has
already
been
said
by
some
of
the
speakers
in
this
body
he
is
not
some
this
is
not
an
issue
in
which
we
are
challenging
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
think
it
important
for
us
to
separate
out
the
issue
of
the
election
outcome
with
the
election
process
was
not
in
this
body
four
years
ago
but
what
observed
as
voter
as
citizen
of
illinois
four
years
ago
were
troubling
evidence
of
the
fact
that
not
every
vote
was
being
counted
and
think
that
it
is
unfortunate
four
years
later
that
we
continue
to
see
circumstances
in
which
people
who
believe
that
they
have
the
right
to
vote
who
show
up
at
the
polls
still
continue
to
confront
the
sort
of
problems
that
have
been
documented
as
taking
place
not
just
in
ohio
but
in
places
all
across
the
country
would
strongly
urge
that
this
chamber
as
well
as
the
house
of
representatives
take
it
upon
itself
once
and
for
all
to
reform
this
system
there
is
no
reason
at
time
when
we
have
enormous
battles
taking
place
ideologically
all
across
the
globe
at
time
when
we
try
to
make
certain
that
we
encourage
democracy
in
iraq
and
and
other
places
throughout
the
world
that
we
have
the
legitimacy
of
our
elections
challenged
rightly
or
wrongly
by
people
who
are
not
certain
as
to
whether
our
processes
are
fair
and
just
this
is
something
that
we
can
fix
we
have
experts
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
who
know
how
to
fix
it
what
we
lacked
is
the
political
will
would
strongly
urge
that
in
circumstance
in
which
too
many
voters
have
stood
in
long
lines
for
hours
in
which
too
many
voters
have
cast
votes
on
machines
that
jam
or
malfunction
or
suck
the
votes
without
trace
in
which
too
many
voters
try
to
register
to
vote
only
to
discover
that
their
names
do
appear
on
the
roles
or
that
partisan
political
interests
and
those
that
serve
them
have
worked
hard
to
throw
up
every
barrier
to
them
as
lawful
in
which
too
many
voters
will
know
that
there
are
different
elections
for
different
parts
of
the
country
and
that
these
differences
turn
shamefully
on
differences
of
wealth
or
of
race
in
which
too
many
voters
have
to
contend
with
state
officials
servants
of
the
public
who
put
partisan
or
personal
political
interests
ahead
of
the
public
in
administering
our
elections
in
such
circumstances
we
have
an
obligation
to
fix
the
problem
and
have
to
add
that
this
is
not
problem
unique
to
this
election
and
it
is
not
partisan
problem
keep
in
mind
come
from
cook
county
from
chicago
in
which
there
is
long
record
of
these
kinds
of
problems
taking
place
and
republicans
as
well
as
democrats
so
would
ask
that
all
of
us
rise
up
and
use
this
occasion
senate
president
senator
time
has
expired
senator
to
amend
this
problem
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
you
make
us
all
proud
on
behalf
of
the
great
state
of
illinois
crossroads
of
nation
land
of
lincoln
let
me
express
my
deepest
gratitude
for
the
privilege
of
addressing
this
convention
tonight
is
particular
for
me
because
face
it
my
presence
on
this
stage
is
pretty
unlikely
my
father
was
foreign
student
born
and
raised
in
small
village
in
kenya
he
grew
up
herding
goats
went
to
school
in
shack
his
father
my
grandfather
was
cook
domestic
servant
to
the
british
but
my
grandfather
had
larger
dreams
for
his
son
through
hard
work
and
perseverance
my
father
got
scholarship
to
study
in
magical
place
america
that
shone
as
beacon
of
freedom
and
opportunity
to
so
many
who
had
come
before
while
studying
here
my
father
met
my
mother
she
was
born
in
town
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
in
her
father
worked
on
oil
rigs
and
farms
through
most
of
the
depression
the
day
after
pearl
my
grandfather
signed
up
for
duty
joined
army
marched
across
europe
back
home
my
grandmother
raised
baby
and
went
to
work
on
bomber
assembly
line
after
the
war
they
studied
on
the
bill
bought
house
through
and
later
moved
west
all
the
way
to
hawaii
in
search
of
opportunity
and
they
too
had
big
dreams
for
their
daughter
common
dream
born
of
two
continents
my
parents
shared
not
only
an
improbable
love
they
shared
an
abiding
faith
in
the
possibilities
of
this
nation
they
would
give
me
an
african
name
or
believing
that
in
tolerant
america
your
name
is
no
barrier
to
success
they
imagined
they
imagined
me
going
to
the
best
schools
in
the
land
even
though
they
rich
because
in
generous
america
you
have
to
be
rich
to
achieve
your
potential
they
both
passed
away
now
and
yet
know
that
on
this
night
they
look
down
on
me
with
great
pride
they
stand
here
and
stand
here
today
grateful
for
the
diversity
of
my
heritage
aware
that
my
dreams
live
on
in
my
two
precious
daughters
stand
here
knowing
that
my
story
is
part
of
the
larger
american
story
that
owe
debt
to
all
of
those
who
came
before
me
and
that
in
no
other
country
on
earth
is
my
story
even
possible
tonight
we
gather
to
affirm
the
greatness
of
our
nation
not
because
of
the
height
of
our
skyscrapers
or
the
power
of
our
military
or
the
size
of
our
economy
our
pride
is
based
on
very
simple
premise
summed
up
in
declaration
made
over
two
hundred
years
ago
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
is
the
true
genius
of
america
faith
faith
in
simple
dreams
an
insistence
on
small
miracles
that
we
can
tuck
in
our
children
at
night
and
know
that
they
are
fed
and
clothed
and
safe
from
harm
that
we
can
say
what
we
think
write
what
we
think
without
hearing
sudden
knock
on
the
door
that
we
can
have
an
idea
and
start
our
own
business
without
paying
bribe
that
we
can
participate
in
the
political
process
without
fear
of
retribution
and
that
our
votes
will
be
counted
at
least
most
of
the
time
this
year
in
this
election
we
are
called
to
reaffirm
our
values
and
our
commitments
to
hold
them
against
hard
reality
and
see
how
we
measuring
up
to
the
legacy
of
our
and
the
promise
of
future
generations
and
fellow
americans
democrats
republicans
independents
say
to
you
tonight
we
have
more
work
to
do
more
work
to
do
for
the
workers
met
in
illinois
who
are
losing
their
union
jobs
at
the
plant
moving
to
mexico
and
now
are
having
to
compete
with
their
own
children
for
jobs
that
pay
seven
bucks
an
hour
more
to
do
for
the
father
that
met
who
was
losing
his
job
and
choking
back
the
tears
wondering
how
he
would
pay
dollars
month
for
the
drugs
his
son
needs
without
the
health
benefits
that
he
counted
on
more
to
do
for
the
young
woman
in
east
louis
and
thousands
more
like
her
who
has
the
grades
has
the
drive
has
the
will
but
have
the
money
to
go
to
college
now
get
me
wrong
the
people
meet
in
small
towns
and
big
cities
in
diners
and
office
parks
they
expect
government
to
solve
all
their
problems
they
know
they
have
to
work
hard
to
get
ahead
and
they
want
to
go
into
the
collar
counties
around
chicago
and
people
will
tell
you
they
want
their
tax
money
wasted
by
welfare
agency
or
by
the
pentagon
go
in
go
into
any
inner
city
and
folks
will
tell
you
that
government
alone
teach
our
kids
to
learn
they
know
that
parents
have
to
teach
that
children
achieve
unless
we
raise
their
expectations
and
turn
off
the
television
sets
and
eradicate
the
slander
that
says
black
youth
with
book
is
acting
white
they
know
those
things
people
expect
people
do
expect
government
to
solve
all
their
problems
but
they
sense
deep
in
their
bones
that
with
just
slight
change
in
priorities
we
can
make
sure
that
every
child
in
america
has
decent
shot
at
life
and
that
the
doors
of
opportunity
remain
open
to
all
they
know
we
can
do
better
and
they
want
that
choice
in
this
election
we
offer
that
choice
our
party
has
chosen
man
to
lead
us
who
embodies
the
best
this
country
has
to
offer
and
that
man
is
john
john
understands
the
ideals
of
community
faith
and
service
because
defined
his
life
from
his
heroic
service
to
to
his
years
as
prosecutor
and
lieutenant
governor
through
two
decades
in
the
united
states
senate
he
devoted
himself
to
this
country
again
and
again
seen
him
make
tough
choices
when
easier
ones
were
available
his
values
and
his
record
affirm
what
is
best
in
us
john
believes
in
an
america
where
hard
work
is
rewarded
so
instead
of
offering
tax
breaks
to
companies
shipping
jobs
overseas
he
offers
them
to
companies
creating
jobs
here
at
home
john
believes
in
an
america
where
all
americans
can
afford
the
same
health
coverage
our
politicians
in
washington
have
for
themselves
john
believes
in
energy
independence
so
we
held
hostage
to
the
profits
of
oil
companies
or
the
sabotage
of
foreign
oil
fields
john
believes
in
the
constitutional
freedoms
that
have
made
our
country
the
envy
of
the
world
and
he
will
never
sacrifice
our
basic
liberties
nor
use
faith
as
wedge
to
divide
us
and
john
believes
that
in
dangerous
world
war
must
be
an
option
sometimes
but
it
should
never
be
the
first
option
you
know
while
back
awhile
back
met
young
man
named
in
hall
in
east
illinois
he
was
kid
six
two
six
three
clear
eyed
with
an
easy
smile
he
told
me
joined
the
marines
and
was
heading
to
iraq
the
following
week
and
as
listened
to
him
explain
why
enlisted
the
absolute
faith
he
had
in
our
country
and
its
leaders
his
devotion
to
duty
and
service
thought
this
young
man
was
all
that
any
of
us
might
ever
hope
for
in
child
but
then
asked
myself
are
we
serving
as
well
as
he
is
serving
us
thought
of
the
men
and
women
sons
and
daughters
husbands
and
wives
friends
and
who
be
returning
to
their
own
thought
of
the
families
met
who
were
struggling
to
get
by
without
loved
full
income
or
whose
loved
ones
had
returned
with
limb
missing
or
nerves
shattered
but
still
lacked
health
benefits
because
they
were
reservists
when
we
send
our
young
men
and
women
into
way
we
have
solemn
obligation
not
to
fudge
the
numbers
or
shade
the
truth
about
why
going
to
care
for
their
families
while
gone
to
tend
to
the
soldiers
upon
their
return
and
to
never
ever
go
to
war
without
enough
troops
to
win
the
war
secure
the
peace
and
earn
the
respect
of
the
world
now
now
let
me
be
clear
let
me
be
clear
we
have
real
enemies
in
the
world
these
enemies
must
be
found
they
must
be
pursued
and
they
must
be
defeated
john
knows
this
and
just
as
lieutenant
did
not
hesitate
to
risk
his
life
to
protect
the
men
who
served
with
him
in
president
will
not
hesitate
one
moment
to
use
our
military
might
to
keep
america
safe
and
secure
john
believes
in
america
and
he
knows
that
not
enough
for
just
some
of
us
to
prosper
for
alongside
our
famous
individualism
another
ingredient
in
the
american
saga
belief
that
all
connected
as
one
people
if
there
is
child
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
who
read
that
matters
to
me
even
if
not
my
child
if
there
is
senior
citizen
somewhere
who
pay
for
their
prescription
drugs
and
having
to
choose
between
medicine
and
the
rent
that
makes
my
life
poorer
even
if
not
my
grandparent
if
an
arab
american
family
being
rounded
up
without
benefit
of
an
attorney
or
due
process
that
threatens
my
civil
liberties
it
is
that
fundamental
belief
it
is
that
fundamental
belief
am
my
keeper
am
my
keeper
that
makes
this
country
work
what
allows
us
to
pursue
our
individual
dreams
and
yet
still
come
together
as
one
american
family
out
of
many
one
now
even
as
we
speak
there
are
those
who
are
preparing
to
divide
us
the
spin
masters
the
negative
peddlers
who
embrace
the
politics
of
anything
goes
well
say
to
them
tonight
there
is
not
liberal
america
and
conservative
america
there
is
the
united
states
of
america
there
is
not
black
america
and
white
america
and
latino
america
and
asian
america
the
united
states
of
america
the
pundits
the
pundits
like
to
our
country
into
red
states
and
blue
states
red
states
for
republicans
blue
states
for
democrats
but
got
news
for
them
too
we
worship
an
awesome
god
in
the
blue
states
and
we
like
federal
agents
poking
around
in
our
libraries
in
the
red
states
we
coach
little
league
in
the
blue
states
and
yes
got
some
gay
friends
in
the
red
states
there
are
patriots
who
opposed
the
war
in
iraq
and
there
are
patriots
who
supported
the
war
in
iraq
we
are
one
people
all
of
us
pledging
allegiance
to
the
stars
and
stripes
all
of
us
defending
the
united
states
of
america
in
the
end
in
the
end
in
the
end
what
this
election
is
about
do
we
participate
in
politics
of
cynicism
or
do
we
participate
in
politics
of
hope
john
calls
on
us
to
hope
john
calls
on
us
to
hope
not
talking
about
blind
optimism
here
the
almost
ignorance
that
thinks
unemployment
will
go
away
if
we
just
think
about
it
or
the
health
care
crisis
will
solve
itself
if
we
just
ignore
it
not
what
talking
about
talking
about
something
more
substantial
the
hope
of
slaves
sitting
around
fire
singing
freedom
songs
the
hope
of
immigrants
setting
out
for
distant
shores
the
hope
of
young
naval
lieutenant
bravely
patrolling
the
delta
the
hope
of
son
who
dares
to
defy
the
odds
the
hope
of
skinny
kid
with
funny
name
who
believes
that
america
has
place
for
him
too
hope
hope
in
the
face
of
difficulty
hope
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
the
audacity
of
hope
in
the
end
that
is
greatest
gift
to
us
the
bedrock
of
this
nation
belief
in
things
not
seen
belief
that
there
are
better
days
ahead
believe
that
we
can
give
our
middle
class
relief
and
provide
working
families
with
road
to
opportunity
believe
we
can
provide
jobs
to
the
jobless
homes
to
the
homeless
and
reclaim
young
people
in
cities
across
america
from
violence
and
despair
believe
that
we
have
righteous
wind
at
our
backs
and
that
as
we
stand
on
the
crossroads
of
history
we
can
make
the
right
choices
and
meet
the
challenges
that
face
us
america
tonight
if
you
feel
the
same
energy
that
do
if
you
feel
the
same
urgency
that
do
if
you
feel
the
same
passion
that
do
if
you
feel
the
same
hopefulness
that
do
if
we
do
what
we
must
do
then
have
no
doubt
that
all
across
the
country
from
florida
to
from
washington
to
maine
the
people
will
rise
up
in
november
and
john
will
be

in
as
president

more
than
one
billion
indians
and
the
largest
democracy
bring
the
greetings
and
friendship
of
the
oldest
democracy
the
united
states
of
america
including
nearly
three
million
proud
and
patriotic
over
the
past
three
days
my
wife
and
have
experienced
the
and
dynamism
of
india
and
its
people
from
the
majesty
of
tomb
to
the
advanced
technologies
that
are
empowering
farmers
and
women
who
are
the
backbone
of
indian
society
from
the
celebrations
with
schoolchildren
to
the
innovators
who
are
economic
rise
from
the
university
students
who
will
chart
future
to
you
leaders
who
helped
to
bring
india
to
this
moment
of
extraordinary
promise
at
every
stop
we
have
been
welcomed
with
the
hospitality
for
which
indians
have
always
been
known
so
to
you
and
the
people
of
india
on
behalf
of
me
and
the
american
people
please
accept
my
deepest
thanks
now
am
not
the
first
american
president
to
visit
india
nor
will
be
the
last
but
am
proud
to
visit
india
so
early
in
my
presidency
no
coincidence
that
india
is
my
first
stop
on
visit
to
asia
or
that
this
has
been
my
longest
visit
to
another
country
since
becoming
president
for
in
asia
and
around
the
world
india
is
not
simply
emerging
india
has
emerged
and
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
india
bound
by
our
shared
interests
and
our
shared
values
will
be
one
of
the
defining
partnerships
of
the
century
this
is
the
partnership
come
here
to
build
this
is
the
vision
that
our
nations
can
together
my
confidence
in
our
shared
future
is
grounded
in
my
respect
for
treasured
past
been
shaping
the
world
for
thousands
of
years
indians
unlocked
the
intricacies
of
the
human
body
and
the
vastness
of
our
universe
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
our
information
age
is
rooted
in
indian
innovations
including
the
number
zero
of
course
india
not
only
opened
our
minds
she
expanded
our
moral
imaginations
with
religious
texts
that
still
summon
the
faithful
to
lives
of
dignity
and
discipline
with
poets
who
imagined
future
the
mind
is
without
fear
and
the
head
is
held
and
with
man
whose
message
of
love
and
justice
endures
the
father
of
your
nation
mahatma
gandhi
for
me
and
this
visit
has
therefore
held
special
meaning
see
throughout
my
life
including
my
work
as
young
man
on
behalf
of
the
urban
poor
always
found
inspiration
in
the
life
of
and
his
simple
and
profound
lesson
to
be
the
change
we
seek
in
the
world
and
just
as
he
summoned
indians
to
seek
their
destiny
he
influenced
champions
of
equality
in
my
own
country
including
young
preacher
named
martin
luther
king
after
making
his
pilgrimage
to
india
ago
king
called
philosophy
of
resistance
only
logical
and
moral
in
the
struggle
for
justice
and
progress
so
we
were
to
visit
the
residence
where
gandhi
and
king
both
stayed
and
we
were
humbled
to
pay
our
respects
at
raj
and
am
mindful
that
might
not
be
standing
before
you
today
as
president
of
the
united
states
had
it
not
been
for
gandhi
and
the
message
he
shared
and
inspired
with
america
and
the
world
an
ancient
of
science
and
innovation
fundamental
faith
in
human
progress
this
is
the
sturdy
foundation
upon
which
you
have
built
ever
since
that
stroke
of
midnight
when
the
was
raised
over
free
and
independent
india
and
despite
the
who
said
this
country
was
simply
too
poor
or
too
vast
or
too
diverse
to
succeed
you
surmounted
overwhelming
odds
and
became
model
to
the
world
instead
of
slipping
into
starvation
you
launched
green
revolution
that
fed
millions
instead
of
becoming
dependent
on
commodities
and
exports
you
invested
in
science
and
technology
and
in
your
greatest
resource
the
indian
people
and
the
world
sees
the
results
from
the
supercomputers
you
build
to
the
indian
flag
that
you
put
on
the
moon
instead
of
resisting
the
global
economy
you
became
one
of
its
engines
reforming
the
licensing
raj
and
unleashing
an
economic
marvel
that
has
lifted
tens
of
millions
of
people
from
poverty
and
created
one
of
the
largest
middle
classes
instead
of
succumbing
to
division
you
have
shown
that
the
strength
of
india
the
very
idea
of
india
is
its
embrace
of
all
all
castes
all
creeds
the
diversity
represented
in
this
chamber
today
the
richness
of
faiths
celebrated
by
visitor
to
my
of
chicago
more
than
century
ago
the
renowned
he
said
that
purity
and
charity
are
not
the
exclusive
possessions
of
any
church
in
the
world
and
that
every
system
has
produced
men
and
women
of
the
most
exalted
and
instead
of
being
lured
by
the
false
notion
that
progress
must
come
at
the
expense
of
freedom
you
built
the
institutions
upon
which
true
democracy
depends
free
and
fair
elections
which
enable
citizens
to
choose
their
own
leaders
without
recourse
to
arms
an
independent
judiciary
and
the
rule
of
law
which
allows
people
to
address
their
grievances
and
thriving
free
press
and
vibrant
civil
society
which
allows
every
voice
to
be
heard
this
year
as
india
marks
years
with
strong
and
democratic
constitution
the
lesson
is
clear
india
has
succeeded
not
in
spite
of
democracy
india
has
succeeded
because
of
democracy
now
just
as
india
has
changed
so
too
has
the
relationship
between
our
two
nations
in
the
decades
after
independence
india
advanced
its
interests
as
proud
leader
of
the
movement
yet
too
often
the
united
states
and
india
found
ourselves
on
opposite
sides
of
divide
estranged
by
long
cold
war
those
days
are
over
here
in
india
two
successive
governments
led
by
different
parties
have
that
deeper
partnership
with
america
is
both
natural
and
necessary
and
in
the
united
states
both
of
my
predecessors
one
democrat
one
republican
worked
to
bring
us
closer
leading
to
increased
trade
and
landmark
civil
nuclear
agreement
so
since
that
time
people
in
both
our
countries
have
asked
next
how
can
we
build
on
this
progress
and
the
full
potential
of
our
partnership
what
want
to
address
today
the
future
that
the
united
states
seeks
in
an
interconnected
world
and
why
believe
that
india
is
indispensable
to
this
vision
how
we
can
forge
truly
global
partnership
not
just
in
one
or
two
areas
but
across
many
not
just
for
our
mutual
benefit
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
world
of
course
only
indians
can
determine
national
interests
and
how
to
advance
them
on
the
world
stage
but
stand
before
you
today
because
am
convinced
that
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
interests
we
share
with
india
are
best
advanced
in
partnership
believe
that
the
united
states
seeks
security
the
security
of
our
country
our
allies
and
partners
we
seek
prosperity
strong
and
growing
economy
in
an
open
international
economic
system
we
seek
respect
for
universal
values
and
we
seek
just
and
sustainable
international
order
that
promotes
peace
and
security
by
meeting
global
challenges
through
stronger
global
cooperation
now
to
advance
these
interests
have
committed
the
united
states
to
comprehensive
engagement
with
the
world
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
central
pillar
of
this
engagement
is
forging
deeper
cooperation
with
century
of
influence
and
that
must
necessarily
include
india
now
india
is
not
the
only
emerging
power
in
the
world
but
relationships
between
our
countries
is
unique
for
we
are
two
strong
democracies
whose
constitutions
begin
with
the
same
revolutionary
words
the
same
revolutionary
words
the
we
are
two
great
republics
dedicated
to
the
liberty
and
justice
and
equality
of
all
people
and
we
are
two
free
market
economies
where
people
have
the
freedom
to
pursue
ideas
and
innovation
that
can
change
the
world
and
why
believe
that
india
and
america
are
indispensable
partners
in
meeting
the
challenges
of
our
time
since
taking
office
therefore
made
our
relationship
priority
was
proud
to
welcome
prime
minister
for
the
first
official
state
visit
of
my
presidency
for
the
first
time
ever
our
governments
are
working
together
across
the
whole
range
of
common
challenges
that
we
face
now
let
me
say
it
as
clearly
as
can
the
united
states
not
only
welcomes
india
as
rising
global
power
we
fervently
support
it
and
we
have
worked
to
help
make
it
reality
together
with
our
partners
we
have
made
the
the
premier
forum
for
international
economic
cooperation
bringing
more
voices
to
the
table
of
global
economic
and
that
has
included
india
increased
the
role
of
emerging
economies
like
india
at
international
financial
institutions
we
valued
important
role
at
where
for
the
first
time
all
major
economies
committed
to
take
action
to
confront
climate
change
and
to
stand
by
those
actions
we
salute
long
history
as
leading
contributor
to
united
nations
peacekeeping
missions
and
we
welcome
india
as
it
prepares
to
take
its
seat
on
the
united
nations
security
council
in
short
with
india
assuming
its
rightful
place
in
the
world
we
have
an
historic
opportunity
to
make
the
relationship
between
our
two
countries
defining
partnership
of
the
century
ahead
and
believe
we
can
do
so
by
working
together
in
three
important
areas
first
as
global
partners
we
can
promote
prosperity
in
both
our
countries
together
we
can
create
the
jobs
of
the
future
with
my
visit
we
are
now
ready
to
begin
implementing
our
civil
nuclear
agreement
this
will
help
meet
growing
energy
needs
and
create
thousands
of
jobs
in
both
of
our
countries
we
need
to
forge
partnerships
in
sectors
like
and
civil
space
so
removed
indian
from
our
and
work
to
remove
and
reform
our
controls
on
exports
both
of
these
steps
will
ensure
that
indian
companies
seeking
trade
and
technologies
from
america
are
treated
the
same
as
our
very
closest
allies
and
partners
we
can
pursue
joint
research
and
development
to
create
green
jobs
give
india
more
access
to
cleaner
affordable
energy
meet
the
commitments
we
made
at
and
show
the
possibilities
of
growth
and
together
we
can
resist
the
protectionism
that
stifles
growth
and
innovation
the
united
states
remains
and
will
continue
to
remain
one
of
the
most
open
economies
in
the
world
and
by
opening
markets
and
reducing
barriers
to
foreign
investment
india
can
its
full
economic
potential
as
well
as
partners
we
can
make
sure
the
global
economic
recovery
is
strong
and
is
durable
and
we
can
keep
striving
for
round
that
is
ambitious
and
is
balanced
with
the
courage
to
make
the
compromises
that
are
necessary
so
global
trade
works
for
all
economies
together
we
can
strengthen
agriculture
cooperation
between
indian
and
american
researchers
and
scientists
sparked
the
green
revolution
today
india
is
leader
in
using
technology
to
empower
farmers
like
those
met
yesterday
who
get
free
updates
on
market
and
weather
conditions
on
their
cell
phones
and
the
united
states
is
leader
in
agricultural
productivity
and
research
now
as
farmers
and
rural
areas
face
the
effects
of
climate
change
and
drought
work
together
to
spark
second
more
sustainable
evergreen
revolution
together
improving
indian
weather
forecasting
systems
before
the
next
monsoon
season
we
aim
to
help
millions
of
indian
farmers
farming
households
save
water
and
increase
productivity
improve
food
processing
so
crops
spoil
on
the
way
to
market
and
enhance
climate
and
crop
forecasting
to
avoid
losses
that
cripple
communities
and
drive
up
food
prices
and
as
part
of
our
food
security
initiative
going
to
share
expertise
with
farmers
in
africa
and
this
is
an
indication
of
rise
that
we
can
now
export
expertise
to
countries
that
see
india
as
model
for
agricultural
development
another
powerful
example
of
how
american
and
indian
partnership
can
address
an
urgent
global
challenge
because
the
wealth
of
nation
also
depends
on
the
health
of
its
people
continue
to
support
effort
against
diseases
like
tuberculosis
and
and
as
global
partners
work
to
improve
global
health
by
preventing
the
spread
of
pandemic
and
because
knowledge
is
the
currency
of
the
century
we
will
increase
exchanges
between
our
students
our
colleges
and
our
universities
which
are
among
the
best
in
the
world
as
we
work
to
advance
our
shared
prosperity
we
can
partner
to
address
second
priority
and
that
is
our
shared
security
in
met
with
the
courageous
families
and
survivors
of
that
barbaric
attack
and
here
in
parliament
which
was
itself
targeted
because
of
the
democracy
it
represents
we
the
memory
of
all
those
who
have
been
taken
from
us
including
american
citizens
on
and
indian
citizens
on
this
is
the
bond
that
we
share
why
we
insist
that
nothing
ever
justifies
the
slaughter
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
why
working
together
more
closely
than
ever
to
prevent
terrorist
attacks
and
to
deepen
our
cooperation
even
further
and
why
as
strong
and
resilient
societies
we
refuse
to
live
in
fear
we
will
not
sacrifice
the
values
and
rule
of
law
that
defines
us
and
we
will
never
waver
in
the
of
our
people
fight
against
and
its
terrorist
affiliates
is
why
we
persevere
in
where
major
development
assistance
from
india
has
improved
the
lives
of
the
afghan
people
making
progress
in
our
mission
to
break
the
momentum
and
to
train
afghan
forces
so
they
can
take
the
lead
for
their
security
and
while
have
made
it
clear
that
american
forces
will
begin
the
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
next
summer
also
made
it
clear
that
commitment
to
the
afghan
people
will
endure
the
united
states
will
not
abandon
the
people
of
or
the
region
to
violent
extremists
who
threaten
us
all
our
strategy
to
disrupt
and
dismantle
and
defeat
and
its
affiliates
has
to
succeed
on
both
sides
of
the
border
and
why
we
have
worked
with
the
government
to
address
the
threat
of
terrorist
networks
in
the
border
region
the
government
increasingly
that
these
networks
are
not
just
threat
outside
of
pakistan
they
are
threat
to
the
people
as
well
suffered
greatly
at
the
hands
of
violent
extremists
over
the
last
several
years
and
continue
to
insist
to
pakistan
leaders
that
terrorist
safe
havens
within
their
borders
are
unacceptable
and
that
terrorists
behind
the
attacks
must
be
brought
to
justice
we
must
also
that
all
of
us
have
an
interest
in
both
an
and
pakistan
that
is
stable
and
prosperous
and
democratic
and
india
has
an
interest
in
that
as
well
in
pursuit
of
regional
security
we
will
continue
to
welcome
dialogue
between
india
and
pakistan
even
as
we
that
disputes
between
your
two
countries
can
only
be
resolved
by
the
people
of
your
two
countries
more
broadly
india
and
the
united
states
can
partner
in
asia
today
the
united
states
is
once
again
playing
leadership
role
in
asia
strengthening
old
alliances
deepening
relationships
as
we
are
doing
with
china
and
with
regional
like
and
joining
the
east
asia
summit
in
which
india
is
also
partner
like
your
in
asia
we
want
india
not
only
to
east
we
want
india
to
because
it
will
increase
the
security
and
prosperity
of
all
our
nations
as
two
global
leaders
the
united
states
and
india
can
partner
for
global
security
especially
as
india
serves
on
the
security
council
over
the
next
two
years
indeed
the
just
and
sustainable
international
order
that
america
seeks
includes
united
nations
that
is
efficient
effective
credible
and
legitimate
that
is
why
can
say
today
in
the
years
ahead
look
forward
to
reformed
united
nations
security
council
that
includes
india
as
permanent
member
now
let
me
suggest
that
with
increased
power
comes
increased
responsibility
the
united
nations
exists
to
its
founding
ideals
of
preserving
peace
and
security
promoting
global
cooperation
and
advancing
human
rights
these
are
the
responsibilities
of
all
nations
but
especially
those
that
seek
to
lead
in
the
century
and
so
we
look
forward
to
working
with
india
and
other
nations
that
aspire
to
security
council
membership
to
ensure
that
the
security
council
is
effective
that
resolutions
are
implemented
that
sanctions
are
enforced
that
we
strengthen
the
international
norms
which
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
all
nations
and
all
individuals
this
includes
our
responsibility
to
prevent
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
since
took
office
the
united
states
has
reduced
the
role
of
nuclear
weapons
in
our
national
security
strategy
and
we
agreed
with
russia
to
reduce
our
own
arsenals
we
have
put
preventing
nuclear
proliferation
and
nuclear
terrorism
at
the
top
of
our
nuclear
agenda
and
we
have
strengthened
the
cornerstone
of
the
global
regime
which
is
the
nuclear
treaty
together
the
united
states
and
india
can
pursue
our
goal
of
securing
the
vulnerable
nuclear
materials
we
can
make
it
clear
that
even
as
every
nation
has
the
right
to
peaceful
nuclear
energy
every
nation
must
also
meet
its
international
obligations
and
that
includes
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
and
together
we
can
pursue
vision
that
indian
leaders
have
espoused
since
independence
world
without
nuclear
weapons
and
this
leads
me
to
the
final
area
where
our
countries
can
partner
strengthening
the
foundations
of
democratic
governance
not
only
at
home
but
abroad
in
the
united
states
my
administration
has
worked
to
make
government
more
open
and
transparent
and
accountable
to
people
here
in
india
harnessing
technologies
to
do
the
same
as
saw
yesterday
at
an
expo
in
your
landmark
right
to
information
act
is
empowering
citizens
with
the
ability
to
get
the
services
to
which
entitled
and
to
hold
officials
accountable
voters
can
get
information
about
candidates
by
text
message
and
delivering
education
and
health
care
services
to
rural
communities
as
saw
yesterday
when
joined
an
with
villagers
in
now
in
new
collaboration
on
open
government
our
two
countries
are
going
to
share
our
experience
identify
what
works
and
develop
the
next
generation
of
tools
to
empower
citizens
and
in
another
example
of
how
american
and
indian
partnership
can
address
global
challenges
going
to
share
these
innovations
with
civil
society
groups
and
countries
around
the
world
going
to
show
that
democracy
more
than
any
other
form
of
government
delivers
for
the
common
man
and
woman
likewise
when
indians
vote
the
whole
world
watches
thousands
of
political
parties
hundreds
of
thousands
of
polling
millions
of
candidates
and
poll
workers
and
million
voters
nothing
like
it
on
the
planet
there
is
so
much
that
countries
to
democracy
could
learn
from
experience
so
much
expertise
that
india
can
share
with
the
world
and
that
too
is
what
is
possible
when
the
largest
democracy
embraces
its
role
as
global
leader
as
the
two
largest
democracies
we
must
never
forget
that
the
price
of
our
own
freedom
is
standing
up
for
the
freedom
of
others
indians
know
this
for
it
is
the
story
of
your
nation
before
he
ever
began
his
struggle
for
indian
independence
gandhi
stood
up
for
the
rights
of
indians
in
south
africa
just
as
others
including
the
united
states
supported
indian
independence
india
championed
the
of
peoples
from
africa
to
asia
as
they
too
broke
free
from
colonialism
and
along
with
the
united
states
been
leader
in
supporting
democratic
development
and
civil
society
groups
around
the
world
and
this
too
is
part
of
greatness
now
we
all
understand
every
country
will
follow
its
own
path
no
one
nation
has
monopoly
on
wisdom
and
no
nation
should
ever
try
to
impose
its
values
on
another
but
when
peaceful
democratic
movements
are
suppressed
as
they
have
been
in
burma
for
example
then
the
democracies
of
the
world
can
not
remain
silent
for
it
is
unacceptable
to
gun
down
peaceful
protestors
and
political
prisoners
decade
after
decade
it
is
unacceptable
to
hold
the
aspirations
of
an
entire
people
hostage
to
the
greed
and
paranoia
of
bankrupt
regimes
it
is
unacceptable
to
steal
elections
as
the
regime
in
burma
has
done
again
for
all
the
world
to
see
faced
with
such
gross
violations
of
human
rights
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
international
community
especially
leaders
like
the
united
states
and
india
to
condemn
it
and
if
can
be
frank
in
international
india
has
often
shied
away
from
some
of
these
issues
but
speaking
up
for
those
who
can
not
do
so
for
themselves
is
not
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
other
countries
not
violating
the
rights
of
sovereign
nations
it
is
staying
true
to
our
democratic
principles
it
is
giving
meaning
to
the
human
rights
that
we
say
are
universal
and
it
sustains
the
progress
that
in
asia
and
around
the
world
has
helped
turn
dictatorships
into
democracies
and
ultimately
increased
our
security
in
the
world
so
promoting
shared
prosperity
preserving
peace
and
security
strengthening
democratic
governance
and
human
rights
these
are
the
responsibilities
of
leadership
and
as
global
partners
this
is
the
leadership
that
the
united
states
and
india
can
offer
in
the
century
ultimately
though
this
can
not
be
relationship
only
between
presidents
and
prime
ministers
or
in
the
halls
of
this
parliament
ultimately
this
must
be
partnership
between
our
peoples
so
want
to
conclude
by
speaking
directly
to
the
people
of
india
who
are
watching
today
in
your
lives
you
have
overcome
odds
that
might
have
overwhelmed
lesser
country
in
just
decades
you
have
achieved
progress
and
development
that
took
other
nations
centuries
you
are
now
assuming
your
rightful
place
as
leader
among
nations
your
parents
and
grandparents
imagined
this
your
children
and
grandchildren
will
look
back
on
this
but
only
this
generation
of
indians
can
seize
the
possibilities
of
the
moment
as
you
carry
on
with
the
hard
work
ahead
want
every
indian
citizen
to
know
the
united
states
of
america
will
not
simply
be
cheering
you
on
from
the
sidelines
we
will
be
right
there
with
you
shoulder
to
shoulder
because
we
believe
in
the
promise
of
india
we
believe
that
the
future
is
what
we
make
it
we
believe
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
every
person
can
their
potential
just
as
like
could
lift
himself
up
and
pen
the
words
of
the
constitution
that
protects
the
rights
of
all
indians
we
believe
that
no
matter
where
you
live
whether
village
in
or
the
of
an
old
section
of
or
new
in
every
person
deserves
the
same
chance
to
live
in
security
and
dignity
to
get
an
education
to
find
work
to
give
their
children
better
future
and
we
believe
that
when
countries
and
cultures
put
aside
old
habits
and
attitudes
that
keep
people
apart
when
we
our
common
humanity
then
we
can
begin
to
these
aspirations
that
we
share
simple
lesson
contained
in
that
collection
of
stories
which
has
guided
indians
for
centuries
the
and
the
spirit
of
the
inscription
seen
by
all
who
enter
this
great
hall
one
is
mine
and
the
other
stranger
is
the
concept
of
little
minds
but
to
the
the
world
itself
is
their
this
is
the
story
of
india
this
is
the
story
of
america
that
despite
their
differences
people
can
see
themselves
in
one
another
and
work
together
and
succeed
together
as
one
proud
nation
and
it
can
be
the
spirit
of
partnership
between
our
nations
that
even
as
we
the
histories
which
in
different
times
kept
us
apart
even
as
we
preserve
what
makes
us
unique
in
world
we
can
how
much
we
can
achieve
together
and
if
we
let
this
simple
concept
be
our
guide
if
we
pursue
the
vision
described
today
global
partnership
to
meet
global
challenges
then
have
no
doubt
that
future
generations
indians
and
americans
will
live
in
world
that
is
more
prosperous
and
more
secure
and
more
just
because
of
the
bonds
that
our
generation
has
forged
today
so
thank
you
and
hind
and
long
live
the
partnership
between
india
and
the
united
states
president
my
fellow
delegates
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
great
to
address
this
assembly
for
the
second
time
nearly
two
years
after
my
election
as
president
of
the
united
states
we
know
this
is
no
ordinary
time
for
our
people
each
of
us
comes
here
with
our
own
problems
and
priorities
but
there
are
also
challenges
that
we
share
in
common
as
leaders
and
as
nations
we
meet
within
an
institution
built
from
the
rubble
of
war
designed
to
unite
the
world
in
pursuit
of
peace
and
we
meet
within
city
that
for
centuries
has
welcomed
people
from
across
the
globe
demonstrating
that
individuals
of
every
faith
and
station
can
come
together
to
pursue
opportunity
build
community
and
live
with
the
blessing
of
human
liberty
outside
the
doors
of
this
hall
the
blocks
and
of
this
great
city
tell
the
story
of
difficult
decade
nine
years
ago
the
destruction
of
the
world
trade
threat
that
respected
no
boundary
of
dignity
or
decency
two
years
ago
this
month
financial
crisis
on
wall
street
devastated
american
families
on
main
street
these
separate
challenges
have
affected
people
around
the
globe
men
and
women
and
children
have
been
murdered
by
extremists
from
to
london
from
to
jakarta
the
global
economy
suffered
an
enormous
blow
during
the
financial
crisis
crippling
markets
and
deferring
the
dreams
of
millions
on
every
continent
underneath
these
challenges
to
our
security
and
prosperity
lie
deeper
fears
that
ancient
hatreds
and
religious
divides
are
once
again
ascendant
that
world
which
has
grown
more
interconnected
has
somehow
slipped
beyond
our
control
these
are
some
of
the
challenges
that
my
administration
has
confronted
since
we
came
into
office
and
today
like
to
talk
to
you
about
what
done
over
the
last
months
to
meet
these
challenges
what
our
responsibility
is
to
pursue
peace
in
the
middle
east
and
what
kind
of
world
we
are
trying
to
build
in
this
century
let
me
begin
with
what
we
have
done
have
had
no
greater
focus
as
president
than
rescuing
our
economy
from
potential
catastrophe
and
in
an
age
when
prosperity
is
shared
we
could
not
do
this
alone
so
america
has
joined
with
nations
around
the
world
to
spur
growth
and
the
renewed
demand
that
could
restart
job
creation
we
are
reforming
our
system
of
global
finance
beginning
with
wall
street
reform
here
at
home
so
that
crisis
like
this
never
happens
again
and
we
made
the
the
focal
point
for
international
coordination
because
in
world
where
prosperity
is
more
diffuse
we
must
broaden
our
circle
of
cooperation
to
include
emerging
economies
economies
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
there
is
much
to
show
for
our
efforts
even
as
there
is
much
work
to
be
done
the
global
economy
has
been
pulled
back
from
the
brink
of
depression
and
is
growing
once
more
we
have
resisted
protectionism
and
are
exploring
ways
to
expand
trade
and
commerce
among
nations
but
we
can
not
and
will
not
rest
until
these
seeds
of
progress
grow
into
broader
prosperity
not
only
for
all
americans
but
for
peoples
around
the
globe
as
for
our
common
security
america
is
waging
more
effective
fight
against
while
winding
down
the
war
in
iraq
since
took
office
the
united
states
has
removed
nearly
troops
from
iraq
we
have
done
so
responsibly
as
iraqis
have
to
lead
responsibility
for
the
security
of
their
country
we
are
now
focused
on
building
lasting
partnership
with
the
iraqi
people
while
keeping
our
commitment
to
remove
the
rest
of
our
troops
by
the
end
of
next
year
while
drawing
down
in
iraq
we
have
refocused
on
defeating
and
denying
its
affiliates
safe
haven
in
the
united
states
and
our
allies
are
pursuing
strategy
to
break
the
momentum
and
build
the
capacity
of
government
and
security
forces
so
that
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
can
begin
next
july
and
from
south
asia
to
the
horn
of
africa
we
are
moving
toward
more
targeted
approach
one
that
strengthens
our
partners
and
dismantles
terrorist
networks
without
deploying
large
american
armies
as
we
pursue
the
most
dangerous
extremists
also
denying
them
the
most
dangerous
weapons
and
pursuing
the
peace
and
security
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
earlier
this
year
nations
embraced
to
secure
all
vulnerable
nuclear
materials
within
four
years
we
have
joined
with
russia
to
sign
the
most
comprehensive
arms
control
treaty
in
decades
we
have
reduced
the
role
of
nuclear
weapons
in
our
security
strategy
and
here
at
the
united
nations
we
came
together
to
strengthen
the
nuclear
treaty
as
part
of
our
effort
on
offered
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
an
extended
hand
last
year
and
underscored
that
it
has
both
rights
and
responsibilities
as
member
of
the
international
community
also
said
in
this
hall
that
iran
must
be
held
accountable
if
it
failed
to
meet
those
responsibilities
and
that
is
what
we
have
done
iran
is
the
only
party
to
the
that
can
not
demonstrate
the
peaceful
intentions
of
its
nuclear
program
and
those
actions
have
consequences
through
security
council
resolution
we
made
it
clear
that
international
law
is
not
an
empty
promise
now
let
me
be
clear
once
more
the
united
states
and
the
international
community
seek
resolution
to
our
differences
with
iran
and
the
door
remains
open
to
diplomacy
should
iran
choose
to
walk
through
it
but
the
iranian
government
must
demonstrate
clear
and
credible
commitment
and
confirm
to
the
world
the
peaceful
intent
of
its
nuclear
program
as
we
combat
the
spread
of
deadly
weapons
also
confronting
the
of
climate
change
after
making
historic
investments
in
clean
energy
and
efficiency
at
home
we
helped
forge
an
accord
in
that
for
the
first
time
commits
all
major
economies
to
reduce
their
emissions
we
are
keenly
aware
this
is
just
first
step
and
going
forward
we
will
support
process
in
which
all
major
economies
meet
our
responsibilities
to
protect
the
planet
while
unleashing
the
power
of
clean
energy
to
serve
as
an
engine
of
growth
and
development
america
has
also
embraced
unique
responsibilities
with
come
that
come
with
our
power
since
the
rains
came
and
the
rose
in
pakistan
we
have
pledged
our
assistance
and
we
should
all
support
the
people
as
they
recover
and
rebuild
and
when
the
earth
shook
and
haiti
was
devastated
by
loss
we
joined
coalition
of
nations
in
response
today
we
those
from
the
family
who
lost
their
lives
in
the
earthquake
and
commit
ourselves
to
stand
with
the
people
of
haiti
until
they
can
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
amidst
this
upheaval
we
have
also
been
persistent
in
our
pursuit
of
peace
last
year
pledged
my
best
efforts
to
support
the
goal
of
two
states
israel
and
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
as
part
of
comprehensive
peace
between
israel
and
all
of
its
we
have
travelled
winding
road
over
the
last
months
with
few
peaks
and
many
valleys
but
this
month
am
pleased
that
we
have
pursued
direct
negotiations
between
israelis
and
in
washington
sheikh
and
now
many
are
pessimistic
about
this
process
the
cynics
say
that
israelis
and
are
too
distrustful
of
each
other
and
too
divided
internally
to
forge
lasting
peace
on
both
sides
will
try
to
disrupt
the
process
with
bitter
words
and
with
bombs
and
with
gunfire
some
say
that
the
gaps
between
the
parties
are
too
big
the
potential
for
talks
to
break
down
is
too
great
and
that
after
decades
of
failure
peace
is
simply
not
possible
hear
those
voices
of
but
ask
you
to
consider
the
alternative
if
an
agreement
is
not
reached
will
never
know
the
pride
and
dignity
that
comes
with
their
own
state
israelis
will
never
know
the
certainty
and
security
that
comes
with
sovereign
and
stable
who
are
committed
to
coexistence
the
hard
realities
of
demography
will
take
hold
more
blood
will
be
shed
this
holy
land
will
remain
symbol
of
our
differences
instead
of
our
common
humanity
refuse
to
accept
that
future
and
we
all
have
choice
to
make
each
of
us
must
choose
the
path
of
peace
of
course
that
responsibility
begins
with
the
parties
themselves
who
must
answer
the
call
of
history
earlier
this
month
at
the
white
house
was
struck
by
the
words
of
both
the
israeli
and
leaders
prime
minister
said
came
here
today
to
find
historic
compromise
that
will
enable
both
people
to
live
in
peace
security
and
and
president
said
will
spare
no
effort
and
we
will
work
diligently
and
tirelessly
to
ensure
these
negotiations
achieve
their
these
words
must
now
be
followed
by
action
and
believe
that
both
leaders
have
the
courage
to
do
so
but
the
road
that
they
have
to
travel
is
exceedingly
difficult
which
is
why
call
upon
israelis
and
and
the
world
to
rally
behind
the
goal
that
these
leaders
now
share
we
know
that
there
will
be
tests
along
the
way
and
that
one
test
is
fast
approaching
settlement
moratorium
has
made
difference
on
the
ground
and
improved
the
atmosphere
for
talks
and
our
position
on
this
issue
is
well
known
we
believe
that
the
moratorium
should
be
extended
we
also
believe
that
talks
should
press
on
until
completed
now
is
the
time
for
the
parties
to
help
each
other
overcome
this
obstacle
now
is
the
time
to
build
the
trust
and
provide
the
time
for
substantial
progress
to
be
made
now
is
the
time
for
this
opportunity
to
be
seized
so
that
it
does
not
slip
away
now
peace
must
be
made
by
israelis
and
but
each
of
us
has
responsibility
to
do
our
part
as
well
those
of
us
who
are
friends
of
israel
must
understand
that
true
security
for
the
jewish
state
requires
an
independent
one
that
allows
the
people
to
live
with
dignity
and
opportunity
and
those
of
us
who
are
friends
of
the
must
understand
that
the
rights
of
the
people
will
be
won
only
through
peaceful
means
including
genuine
reconciliation
with
secure
israel
know
many
in
this
hall
count
themselves
as
friends
of
the
but
these
pledges
of
friendship
must
now
be
supported
by
deeds
those
who
have
signed
on
to
the
arab
peace
initiative
should
seize
this
opportunity
to
make
it
real
by
taking
tangible
steps
towards
the
that
it
promises
israel
and
those
who
speak
on
behalf
of
should
help
the
authority
politically
and
financially
and
in
doing
so
help
the
build
the
institutions
of
their
state
those
who
long
to
see
an
independent
must
also
stop
trying
to
tear
down
israel
after
thousands
of
years
jews
and
arabs
are
not
strangers
in
strange
land
after
years
in
the
community
of
nations
existence
must
not
be
subject
for
debate
israel
is
sovereign
state
and
the
historic
homeland
of
the
jewish
people
it
should
be
clear
to
all
that
efforts
to
chip
away
at
legitimacy
will
only
be
met
by
the
unshakeable
opposition
of
the
united
states
and
efforts
to
threaten
or
kill
israelis
will
do
nothing
to
help
the
people
the
slaughter
of
innocent
israelis
is
not
resistance
injustice
and
make
no
mistake
the
courage
of
man
like
president
who
stands
up
for
his
people
in
front
of
the
world
under
very
difficult
circumstances
is
far
greater
than
those
who
fire
rockets
at
innocent
women
and
children
the
conflict
between
israelis
and
arabs
is
as
old
as
this
institution
and
we
can
come
back
here
next
year
as
we
have
for
the
last
years
and
make
long
speeches
about
it
we
can
read
familiar
lists
of
grievances
we
can
table
the
same
resolutions
we
can
further
empower
the
forces
of
and
hate
and
we
can
waste
more
time
by
carrying
forward
an
argument
that
will
not
help
single
israeli
or
child
achieve
better
life
we
can
do
that
or
we
can
say
that
this
time
will
be
different
that
this
time
we
will
not
let
terror
or
turbulence
or
posturing
or
petty
politics
stand
in
the
way
this
time
we
will
think
not
of
ourselves
but
of
the
young
girl
in
who
wants
to
have
no
ceiling
on
her
dreams
or
the
young
boy
in
who
wants
to
sleep
without
the
nightmare
of
rocket
fire
this
time
we
should
draw
upon
the
teachings
of
tolerance
that
lie
at
the
heart
of
three
great
religions
that
see
soil
as
sacred
this
time
we
should
reach
for
best
within
ourselves
if
we
do
when
we
come
back
here
next
year
we
can
have
an
agreement
that
will
lead
to
new
member
of
the
united
nations
an
independent
sovereign
state
of
living
in
peace
with
israel
it
is
our
destiny
to
bear
the
burdens
of
the
challenges
that
addressed
recession
and
war
and
conflict
and
there
is
always
sense
of
urgency
even
emergency
that
drives
most
of
our
foreign
policies
indeed
after
millennia
marked
by
wars
this
very
institution
reflects
the
desire
of
human
beings
to
create
forum
to
deal
with
emergencies
that
will
inevitably
come
but
even
as
we
confront
immediate
challenges
we
must
also
summon
the
foresight
to
look
beyond
them
and
consider
what
we
are
trying
to
build
over
the
long
term
what
is
the
world
that
awaits
us
when
battles
are
brought
to
an
end
and
that
is
what
would
like
to
talk
about
with
the
remainder
of
my
time
today
one
of
the
first
actions
of
this
general
assembly
was
to
adopt
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
in
that
declaration
begins
by
stating
that
of
the
inherent
dignity
and
of
the
equal
and
inalienable
rights
of
all
members
of
the
human
family
is
the
foundation
of
freedom
justice
and
peace
in
the
the
idea
is
simple
one
that
freedom
justice
and
peace
for
the
world
must
begin
with
freedom
justice
and
peace
in
the
lives
of
individual
human
beings
and
for
the
united
states
this
is
matter
of
moral
and
pragmatic
necessity
as
kennedy
said
individual
man
the
child
of
god
is
the
of
value
and
all
society
groups
the
state
exist
for
his
so
we
stand
up
for
universal
values
because
the
right
thing
to
do
but
we
also
know
from
experience
that
those
who
defend
these
values
for
their
people
have
been
our
closest
friends
and
allies
while
those
who
have
denied
those
rights
whether
terrorist
groups
or
tyrannical
governments
have
chosen
to
be
our
adversaries
human
rights
have
never
gone
unchallenged
not
in
any
of
our
nations
and
not
in
our
world
tyranny
is
still
with
us
whether
it
manifests
itself
in
the
killing
girls
who
try
to
go
to
school
north
korean
regime
that
enslaves
its
own
people
or
an
armed
group
in
that
use
rape
as
weapon
of
war
in
times
of
economic
unease
there
can
also
be
an
anxiety
about
human
rights
today
as
in
past
times
of
economic
downturn
some
put
human
rights
aside
for
the
promise
of
short
term
stability
or
the
false
notion
that
economic
growth
can
come
at
the
expense
of
freedom
we
see
leaders
abolishing
term
limits
we
see
crackdowns
on
civil
society
we
see
corruption
smothering
entrepreneurship
and
good
governance
we
see
democratic
reforms
deferred
indefinitely
as
said
last
year
each
country
will
pursue
path
rooted
in
the
culture
of
its
own
people
yet
experience
shows
us
that
history
is
on
the
side
of
liberty
that
the
strongest
foundation
for
human
progress
lies
in
open
economies
open
societies
and
open
governments
to
put
it
simply
democracy
more
than
any
other
form
of
government
delivers
for
our
citizens
and
believe
that
truth
will
only
grow
stronger
in
world
where
the
borders
between
nations
are
blurred
america
is
working
to
shape
world
that
fosters
this
openness
for
the
rot
of
closed
or
corrupt
economy
must
never
eclipse
the
energy
and
innovation
of
human
beings
all
of
us
want
the
right
to
educate
our
children
to
make
decent
wage
to
care
for
the
sick
and
to
be
carried
as
far
as
our
dreams
and
our
deeds
will
take
us
but
that
depends
upon
economies
that
tap
the
power
of
our
people
including
the
potential
of
women
and
girls
that
means
letting
entrepreneurs
start
business
without
paying
bribe
and
governments
that
support
opportunity
instead
of
stealing
from
their
people
and
that
means
rewarding
hard
work
instead
of
reckless
yesterday
put
forward
new
development
policy
that
will
pursue
these
goals
that
dignity
is
human
right
and
global
development
is
in
our
common
interest
america
will
partner
with
nations
that
offer
their
people
path
out
of
poverty
and
together
we
must
unleash
growth
that
powers
by
individuals
and
emerging
markets
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
there
is
no
reason
why
africa
should
not
be
an
exporter
of
agriculture
which
is
why
our
food
security
initiative
is
empowering
farmers
there
is
no
reason
why
entrepreneurs
be
able
to
build
new
markets
in
every
society
which
is
why
hosted
summit
on
entrepreneurship
earlier
this
spring
because
the
obligation
of
government
is
to
empower
individuals
not
to
impede
them
the
same
holds
true
for
civil
society
the
arc
of
human
progress
has
been
shaped
by
individuals
with
the
freedom
to
assemble
and
by
outside
of
government
that
insisted
upon
democratic
change
and
by
free
media
that
held
the
powerful
accountable
we
have
seen
that
from
the
south
africans
who
stood
up
to
to
the
poles
of
solidarity
to
the
mothers
of
the
disappeared
who
spoke
out
against
the
dirty
war
to
americans
who
marched
for
the
rights
of
all
races
including
my
own
civil
society
is
the
conscience
of
our
communities
and
america
will
always
extend
our
engagement
abroad
with
citizens
beyond
the
halls
of
government
and
we
will
call
out
those
who
suppress
ideas
and
serve
as
voice
for
those
who
are
voiceless
we
will
promote
new
tools
of
communication
so
people
are
empowered
to
connect
with
one
another
and
in
repressive
societies
to
do
so
with
security
we
will
support
free
and
open
internet
so
individuals
have
the
information
to
make
up
their
own
minds
and
it
is
time
to
embrace
and
effectively
monitor
norms
that
advance
the
rights
of
civil
society
and
guarantee
its
expansion
within
and
across
borders
open
society
supports
open
government
but
it
can
not
substitute
for
it
there
is
no
right
more
fundamental
than
the
ability
to
choose
your
leaders
and
determine
your
destiny
now
make
no
mistake
the
ultimate
success
of
democracy
in
the
world
come
because
the
united
states
dictates
it
it
will
come
because
individual
citizens
demand
say
in
how
they
are
governed
there
is
no
soil
where
this
notion
can
not
take
root
just
as
every
democracy
reflects
the
uniqueness
of
nation
later
this
fall
will
travel
to
asia
and
will
visit
india
which
peacefully
threw
off
colonialism
and
established
thriving
democracy
of
over
billion
people
continue
to
the
largest
country
which
binds
together
thousands
of
islands
through
the
glue
of
representative
government
and
civil
society
join
the
meeting
on
the
korean
peninsula
which
provides
the
clearest
contrast
between
society
that
is
dynamic
and
open
and
free
and
one
that
is
imprisoned
and
closed
and
will
conclude
my
trip
in
japan
an
ancient
culture
that
found
peace
and
extraordinary
development
through
democracy
each
of
these
countries
gives
life
to
democratic
principles
in
their
own
way
and
even
as
some
governments
roll
back
reform
we
also
celebrate
the
courage
of
president
in
who
willingly
stepped
aside
or
the
promise
of
new
constitution
in
kenya
the
common
thread
of
progress
is
the
principle
that
government
is
accountable
to
its
citizens
and
the
diversity
in
this
room
makes
clear
no
one
country
has
all
the
answers
but
all
of
us
must
answer
to
our
own
people
in
all
parts
of
the
world
we
see
the
promise
of
innovation
to
make
government
more
open
and
accountable
and
now
we
must
build
on
that
progress
and
when
we
gather
back
here
next
year
we
should
bring
specific
commitments
to
promote
transparency
to
fight
corruption
to
civic
engagement
to
leverage
new
technologies
so
that
we
strengthen
the
foundations
of
freedom
in
our
own
countries
while
living
up
to
the
ideals
that
can
light
the
world
this
institution
can
still
play
an
indispensable
role
in
the
advance
of
human
rights
time
to
welcome
the
efforts
of
women
to
protect
the
rights
of
women
around
the
globe
time
for
every
member
state
to
open
its
elections
to
international
monitors
and
increase
the
democracy
fund
time
to
reinvigorate
peacekeeping
so
that
missions
have
the
resources
necessary
to
succeed
and
so
atrocities
like
sexual
violence
are
prevented
and
justice
is
enforced
because
neither
dignity
nor
democracy
can
thrive
without
basic
security
and
time
to
make
this
institution
more
accountable
as
well
because
the
challenges
of
new
century
demand
new
ways
of
serving
our
common
interests
the
world
that
america
seeks
is
not
one
we
can
build
on
our
own
for
human
rights
to
reach
those
who
suffer
the
boot
of
oppression
we
need
your
voices
to
speak
out
in
particular
appeal
to
those
nations
who
emerged
from
tyranny
and
inspired
the
world
in
the
second
half
of
the
last
century
from
south
africa
to
south
asia
from
eastern
europe
to
south
america
stand
idly
by
be
silent
when
dissidents
elsewhere
are
imprisoned
and
protesters
are
beaten
recall
your
own
history
because
part
of
the
price
of
our
own
freedom
is
standing
up
for
the
freedom
of
others
that
belief
will
guide
leadership
in
this
century
it
is
belief
that
has
seen
us
through
more
than
two
centuries
of
trial
and
it
will
see
us
through
the
challenges
we
face
today
be
it
war
or
recession
conflict
or
division
so
even
as
we
have
come
through
difficult
decade
stand
here
before
you
confident
in
the
future
future
where
iraq
is
governed
by
neither
tyrant
nor
foreign
power
and
is
freed
from
the
turmoil
of
war
future
where
the
children
of
israel
and
can
build
the
peace
that
was
not
possible
for
their
parents
world
where
the
promise
of
development
reaches
into
the
prisons
of
poverty
and
disease
future
where
the
cloud
of
recession
gives
way
to
the
light
of
renewal
and
the
dream
of
opportunity
is
available
to
all
this
future
will
not
be
easy
to
reach
it
will
not
come
without
setbacks
nor
will
it
be
quickly
claimed
but
the
founding
of
the
united
nations
itself
is
testament
to
human
progress
remember
in
times
that
were
far
more
trying
than
our
own
our
predecessors
chose
the
hope
of
unity
over
the
ease
of
division
and
made
promise
to
future
generations
that
the
dignity
and
equality
of
human
beings
would
be
our
common
cause
it
falls
to
us
to
that
promise
and
though
we
will
be
met
by
dark
forces
that
will
test
our
resolve
americans
have
always
had
cause
to
believe
that
we
can
choose
better
history
that
we
need
only
to
look
outside
the
walls
around
us
for
through
the
citizens
of
every
conceivable
ancestry
who
make
this
city
their
own
we
see
living
proof
that
opportunity
can
be
accessed
by
all
that
what
unites
us
as
human
beings
is
far
greater
than
what
divides
us
and
that
people
from
every
part
of
this
world
can
live
together
in
peace
thank
you
very
much
secretary
gates
admiral
and
members
of
the
armed
forces
my
fellow
americans
most
of
all
to
you
survivors
who
still
carry
the
scars
of
tragedy
and
destruction
to
the
families
who
carry
in
your
hearts
the
memory
of
the
loved
ones
you
lost
here
for
our
nation
this
is
day
of
remembrance
day
of
reflection
and
with
grace
day
of
unity
and
renewal
we
gather
to
remember
at
this
sacred
hour
on
hallowed
ground
at
places
where
we
feel
such
grief
and
where
our
healing
goes
on
we
gather
here
at
the
pentagon
where
the
names
of
the
lost
are
forever
etched
in
stone
we
gather
in
gentle
field
where
plane
went
down
and
of
will
rise
and
echo
through
the
ages
and
we
gather
where
the
twin
towers
fell
site
where
the
work
goes
on
so
that
next
year
on
the
anniversary
the
waters
will
flow
in
steady
tribute
to
the
nearly
innocent
lives
on
this
day
perhaps
natural
to
focus
on
the
images
of
that
awful
morning
images
that
are
seared
into
our
souls
tempting
to
dwell
on
the
final
moments
of
the
loved
ones
whose
lives
were
taken
so
cruelly
yet
these
memorials
and
your
presence
today
remind
us
to
remember
the
fullness
of
their
time
on
earth
they
were
fathers
and
mothers
raising
their
families
brothers
and
sisters
pursuing
their
dreams
sons
and
daughters
their
whole
lives
before
them
they
were
civilians
and
service
members
some
never
saw
the
danger
coming
others
saw
the
peril
and
rushed
to
save
others
up
those
stairwells
into
the
flames
into
the
cockpit
they
were
white
and
black
and
brown
men
and
women
and
some
children
made
up
of
all
races
many
faiths
they
were
americans
and
people
from
far
corners
of
the
world
and
they
were
snatched
from
us
senselessly
and
much
too
soon
but
they
lived
well
and
they
live
on
in
you
nine
years
have
now
passed
in
that
time
you
have
shed
more
tears
than
we
will
ever
know
and
though
it
must
seem
some
days
as
though
the
world
has
moved
on
to
other
things
say
to
you
today
that
your
loved
ones
endure
in
the
heart
of
our
nation
now
and
forever
our
remembrance
today
also
requires
certain
reflection
as
nation
and
as
individuals
we
must
ask
ourselves
how
best
to
them
those
who
died
those
who
sacrificed
how
do
we
preserve
their
legacy
not
just
on
this
day
but
every
day
we
need
not
look
far
for
our
answer
the
perpetrators
of
this
evil
act
simply
attack
america
they
attacked
the
very
idea
of
america
itself
all
that
we
stand
for
and
represent
in
the
world
and
so
the
highest
we
can
pay
those
we
lost
indeed
our
greatest
weapon
in
this
ongoing
war
is
to
do
what
our
adversaries
fear
the
most
to
stay
true
to
who
we
are
as
americans
to
renew
our
sense
of
common
purpose
to
say
that
we
define
the
character
of
our
country
and
we
will
not
let
the
acts
of
some
small
band
of
murderers
who
slaughter
the
innocent
and
cower
in
caves
distort
who
we
are
they
doubted
our
will
but
as
americans
we
persevere
today
in
and
beyond
we
have
gone
on
the
offensive
and
struck
major
blows
against
and
its
allies
we
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
protect
our
country
and
we
all
those
who
serve
to
keep
us
safe
they
may
seek
to
strike
fear
in
us
but
they
are
no
match
for
our
resilience
we
do
not
succumb
to
fear
nor
will
we
squander
the
optimism
that
has
always
defined
us
as
people
on
day
when
others
sought
to
destroy
we
have
chosen
to
build
with
national
day
of
service
and
remembrance
that
summons
the
inherent
goodness
of
the
american
people
they
may
seek
to
exploit
our
freedoms
but
we
will
not
sacrifice
the
liberties
we
cherish
or
down
behind
walls
of
suspicion
and
mistrust
they
may
wish
to
drive
us
apart
but
we
will
not
give
in
to
their
hatred
and
prejudice
for
scripture
teaches
us
to
rid
of
all
bitterness
rage
and
anger
brawling
and
slander
along
with
every
form
of
they
may
seek
to
spark
conflict
between
different
faiths
but
as
americans
we
are
not
and
never
will
be
at
war
with
islam
it
was
not
religion
that
attacked
us
that
september
day
it
was
sorry
band
of
men
which
perverts
religion
and
just
as
we
condemn
intolerance
and
extremism
abroad
so
will
we
stay
true
to
our
traditions
here
at
home
as
diverse
and
tolerant
nation
we
champion
the
rights
of
every
american
including
the
right
to
worship
as
one
chooses
as
service
members
and
civilians
from
many
faiths
do
just
steps
from
here
at
the
very
spot
where
the
terrorists
struck
this
building
those
who
attacked
us
sought
to
us
divide
us
to
deprive
us
of
the
very
unity
the
very
ideals
that
make
america
america
those
qualities
that
have
made
us
beacon
of
freedom
and
hope
to
billions
around
the
world
today
we
declare
once
more
we
will
never
hand
them
that
victory
as
americans
we
will
keep
alive
the
virtues
and
values
that
make
us
who
we
are
and
who
we
must
always
be
for
our
cause
is
just
our
spirit
is
strong
our
resolve
is
unwavering
like
generations
before
us
let
us
come
together
today
and
all
days
to
affirm
certain
inalienable
rights
to
affirm
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
on
this
day
and
the
days
to
come
we
choose
to
stay
true
to
our
best
selves
as
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all
this
is
how
we
choose
to
the
fallen
your
families
your
friends
your
fellow
service
members
this
is
how
we
will
keep
alive
the
legacy
of
these
proud
and
patriotic
americans
this
is
how
we
will
prevail
in
this
great
test
of
our
time
this
is
how
we
will
preserve
and
protect
the
country
that
we
love
and
pass
it
safer
and
stronger
to
future
generations
may
god
bless
you
and
your
families
and
may
god
continue
to
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
evening
tonight
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
end
of
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
the
ongoing
security
challenges
we
face
and
the
need
to
rebuild
our
nation
here
at
home
know
this
historic
moment
comes
at
time
of
great
uncertainty
for
many
americans
now
been
through
nearly
decade
of
war
endured
long
and
painful
recession
and
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
these
storms
the
future
that
trying
to
build
for
our
nation
future
of
lasting
peace
and
prosperity
may
seem
beyond
our
reach
but
this
milestone
should
serve
as
reminder
to
all
americans
that
the
future
is
ours
to
shape
if
we
move
forward
with
confidence
and
commitment
it
should
also
serve
as
message
to
the
world
that
the
united
states
of
america
intends
to
sustain
and
strengthen
our
leadership
in
this
young
century
from
this
desk
seven
and
half
years
ago
president
bush
announced
the
beginning
of
military
operations
in
iraq
much
has
changed
since
that
night
war
to
disarm
state
became
fight
against
an
insurgency
terrorism
and
sectarian
warfare
threatened
to
tear
iraq
apart
thousands
of
americans
gave
their
lives
tens
of
thousands
have
been
wounded
our
relations
abroad
were
strained
our
unity
at
home
was
tested
these
are
the
rough
waters
encountered
during
the
course
of
one
of
longest
wars
yet
there
has
been
one
constant
amidst
these
shifting
tides
at
every
turn
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
served
with
courage
and
resolve
as
am
incredibly
proud
of
their
service
and
like
all
americans
awed
by
their
sacrifice
and
by
the
sacrifices
of
their
families
the
americans
who
have
served
in
iraq
completed
every
mission
they
were
given
they
defeated
regime
that
had
its
people
together
with
iraqis
and
coalition
partners
who
made
huge
sacrifices
of
their
own
our
troops
fought
block
by
block
to
help
iraq
seize
the
chance
for
better
future
they
shifted
tactics
to
protect
the
iraqi
people
trained
iraqi
security
forces
and
took
out
terrorist
leaders
because
of
our
troops
and
civilians
and
because
of
the
resilience
of
the
iraqi
people
iraq
has
the
opportunity
to
embrace
new
destiny
even
though
many
challenges
remain
so
tonight
am
announcing
that
the
american
combat
mission
in
iraq
has
ended
operation
iraqi
freedom
is
over
and
the
iraqi
people
now
have
lead
responsibility
for
the
security
of
their
country
this
was
my
pledge
to
the
american
people
as
candidate
for
this
office
last
february
announced
plan
that
would
bring
our
combat
brigades
out
of
iraq
while
redoubling
our
efforts
to
strengthen
security
forces
and
support
its
government
and
people
what
done
removed
nearly
troops
from
iraq
closed
or
transferred
to
the
iraqis
hundreds
of
bases
and
we
have
moved
millions
of
pieces
of
equipment
out
of
iraq
this
completes
transition
to
iraqi
responsibility
for
their
own
security
troops
pulled
out
of
cities
last
summer
and
iraqi
forces
have
moved
into
the
lead
with
considerable
skill
and
commitment
to
their
fellow
citizens
even
as
iraq
continues
to
suffer
terrorist
attacks
security
incidents
have
been
near
the
lowest
on
record
since
the
war
began
and
iraqi
forces
have
taken
the
fight
to
removing
much
of
its
leadership
in
operations
this
year
also
saw
iraq
hold
credible
elections
that
drew
strong
turnout
caretaker
administration
is
in
place
as
iraqis
form
government
based
on
the
results
of
that
election
tonight
encourage
leaders
to
move
forward
with
sense
of
urgency
to
form
an
inclusive
government
that
is
just
representative
and
accountable
to
the
iraqi
people
and
when
that
government
is
in
place
there
should
be
no
doubt
the
iraqi
people
will
have
strong
partner
in
the
united
states
our
combat
mission
is
ending
but
our
commitment
to
future
is
not
going
forward
transitional
force
of
troops
will
remain
in
iraq
with
different
mission
advising
and
assisting
security
forces
supporting
iraqi
troops
in
targeted
missions
and
protecting
our
civilians
consistent
with
our
agreement
with
the
iraqi
government
all
troops
will
leave
by
the
end
of
next
year
as
our
military
draws
down
our
dedicated
civilians
diplomats
aid
workers
and
are
moving
into
the
lead
to
support
iraq
as
it
strengthens
its
government
resolves
political
disputes
those
displaced
by
war
and
builds
ties
with
the
region
and
the
world
message
that
vice
president
is
delivering
to
the
iraqi
people
through
his
visit
there
today
this
new
approach
reflects
our
partnership
with
iraq
one
based
upon
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
of
course
violence
will
not
end
with
our
combat
mission
extremists
will
continue
to
set
off
bombs
attack
iraqi
civilians
and
try
to
spark
sectarian
strife
but
ultimately
these
terrorists
will
fail
to
achieve
their
goals
iraqis
are
proud
people
they
have
rejected
sectarian
war
and
they
have
no
interest
in
endless
destruction
they
understand
that
in
the
end
only
iraqis
can
resolve
their
differences
and
police
their
streets
only
iraqis
can
build
democracy
within
their
borders
what
america
can
do
and
will
do
is
provide
support
for
the
iraqi
people
as
both
friend
and
partner
ending
this
war
is
not
only
in
interest
in
our
own
the
united
states
has
paid
huge
price
to
put
the
future
of
iraq
in
the
hands
of
its
people
we
have
sent
our
young
men
and
women
to
make
enormous
sacrifices
in
iraq
and
spent
vast
resources
abroad
at
time
of
tight
budgets
at
home
persevered
because
of
belief
we
share
with
the
iraqi
people
belief
that
out
of
the
ashes
of
war
new
beginning
could
be
born
in
this
cradle
of
through
this
remarkable
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
iraq
we
have
met
our
responsibility
now
time
to
turn
the
page
as
we
do
mindful
that
the
iraq
war
has
been
contentious
issue
at
home
here
too
time
to
turn
the
page
this
afternoon
spoke
to
former
president
george
bush
well
known
that
he
and
disagreed
about
the
war
from
its
outset
yet
no
one
can
doubt
president
support
for
our
troops
or
his
love
of
country
and
commitment
to
our
security
as
said
there
were
patriots
who
supported
this
war
and
patriots
who
opposed
it
and
all
of
us
are
united
in
appreciation
for
our
servicemen
and
women
and
our
hopes
for
future
the
greatness
of
our
democracy
is
grounded
in
our
ability
to
move
beyond
our
differences
and
to
learn
from
our
experience
as
we
confront
the
many
challenges
ahead
and
no
challenge
is
more
essential
to
our
security
than
our
fight
against
americans
across
the
political
spectrum
supported
the
use
of
force
against
those
who
attacked
us
on
now
as
we
approach
our
year
of
combat
in
there
are
those
who
are
understandably
asking
tough
questions
about
our
mission
there
but
we
must
never
lose
sight
of
at
stake
as
we
speak
continues
to
plot
against
us
and
its
leadership
remains
anchored
in
the
border
regions
of
and
pakistan
we
will
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
while
preventing
from
again
serving
as
base
for
terrorists
and
because
of
our
in
iraq
we
are
now
able
to
apply
the
resources
necessary
to
go
on
in
fact
over
the
last
months
nearly
dozen
leaders
and
hundreds
of
extremist
allies
have
been
killed
or
captured
around
the
world
within
ordered
the
deployment
of
additional
troops
who
under
the
command
of
general
david
are
fighting
to
break
the
momentum
as
with
the
surge
in
iraq
these
forces
will
be
in
place
for
limited
time
to
provide
space
for
the
afghans
to
build
their
capacity
and
secure
their
own
future
but
as
was
the
case
in
iraq
we
do
for
afghans
what
they
must
ultimately
do
for
themselves
why
training
afghan
security
forces
and
supporting
political
resolution
to
problems
and
next
august
we
will
begin
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
the
pace
of
our
troop
reductions
will
be
determined
by
conditions
on
the
ground
and
our
support
for
will
endure
but
make
no
mistake
this
transition
will
begin
because
war
serves
neither
our
interests
nor
the
afghan
indeed
one
of
the
lessons
of
our
effort
in
iraq
is
that
american
influence
around
the
world
is
not
function
of
military
force
alone
we
must
use
all
elements
of
our
power
including
our
diplomacy
our
economic
strength
and
the
power
of
example
to
secure
our
interests
and
stand
by
our
allies
and
we
must
project
vision
of
the
future
based
not
just
on
our
fears
but
also
on
our
hopes
vision
that
the
real
dangers
that
exist
around
the
world
but
also
the
limitless
possibilities
of
our
time
today
old
adversaries
are
at
peace
and
emerging
democracies
are
potential
partners
new
markets
for
our
goods
stretch
from
asia
to
the
new
push
for
peace
in
the
middle
east
will
begin
here
tomorrow
billions
of
young
people
want
to
move
beyond
the
shackles
of
poverty
and
conflict
as
the
leader
of
the
free
world
america
will
do
more
than
just
defeat
on
the
battlefield
those
who
offer
hatred
and
destruction
we
will
also
lead
among
those
who
are
willing
to
work
together
to
expand
freedom
and
opportunity
for
all
people
now
that
effort
must
begin
within
our
own
borders
throughout
our
history
america
has
been
willing
to
bear
the
burden
of
promoting
liberty
and
human
dignity
overseas
understanding
its
links
to
our
own
liberty
and
security
but
we
have
also
understood
that
our
strength
and
influence
abroad
must
be
firmly
anchored
in
our
prosperity
at
home
and
the
bedrock
of
that
prosperity
must
be
growing
middle
class
unfortunately
over
the
last
decade
not
done
necessary
to
shore
up
the
foundations
of
our
own
prosperity
we
spent
trillion
dollars
at
war
often
financed
by
borrowing
from
overseas
this
in
turn
has
investments
in
our
own
people
and
contributed
to
record
deficits
for
too
long
we
have
put
off
tough
decisions
on
everything
from
our
manufacturing
base
to
our
energy
policy
to
education
reform
as
result
too
many
families
find
themselves
working
harder
for
less
while
our
competitiveness
is
put
at
risk
and
so
at
this
moment
as
we
wind
down
the
war
in
iraq
we
must
tackle
those
challenges
at
home
with
as
much
energy
and
grit
and
sense
of
common
purpose
as
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
have
served
abroad
they
have
met
every
test
that
they
faced
now
our
turn
now
our
responsibility
to
them
by
coming
together
all
of
us
and
working
to
secure
the
dream
that
so
many
generations
have
fought
for
the
dream
that
better
life
awaits
anyone
who
is
willing
to
work
for
it
and
reach
for
it
our
most
urgent
task
is
to
restore
our
economy
and
put
the
millions
of
americans
who
have
lost
their
jobs
back
to
work
to
strengthen
our
middle
class
we
must
give
all
our
children
the
education
they
deserve
and
all
our
workers
the
skills
that
they
need
to
compete
in
global
economy
we
must
jumpstart
industries
that
create
jobs
and
end
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
we
must
unleash
the
innovation
that
allows
new
products
to
roll
off
our
assembly
lines
and
nurture
the
ideas
that
spring
from
our
entrepreneurs
this
will
be
difficult
but
in
the
days
to
come
it
must
be
our
central
mission
as
people
and
my
central
responsibility
as
president
part
of
that
responsibility
is
making
sure
that
we
our
commitments
to
those
who
have
served
our
country
with
such
as
long
as
am
president
we
will
maintain
the
finest
fighting
force
that
the
world
has
ever
known
and
we
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
serve
our
veterans
as
well
as
they
have
served
us
this
is
sacred
trust
why
already
made
one
of
the
largest
increases
in
funding
for
veterans
in
decades
treating
the
signature
wounds
of
wars
stress
disorder
and
traumatic
brain
injury
while
providing
the
health
care
and
benefits
that
all
of
our
veterans
have
earned
and
funding
bill
that
helps
our
veterans
and
their
families
pursue
the
dream
of
college
education
just
as
the
bill
helped
those
who
fought
world
war
including
my
grandfather
become
the
backbone
of
our
middle
class
so
servicemen
and
women
must
have
the
chance
to
apply
their
gifts
to
expand
the
american
economy
because
part
of
ending
war
responsibly
is
standing
by
those
who
have
fought
it
two
weeks
ago
final
combat
brigade
in
iraq
the
fourth
brigade
journeyed
home
in
the
darkness
thousands
of
soldiers
and
hundreds
of
vehicles
made
the
trip
from
baghdad
the
last
of
them
passing
into
kuwait
in
the
early
morning
hours
over
seven
years
before
american
troops
and
coalition
partners
had
fought
their
way
across
similar
highways
but
this
time
no
shots
were
fired
it
was
just
convoy
of
brave
americans
making
their
way
home
of
course
the
soldiers
left
much
behind
some
were
teenagers
when
the
war
began
many
have
served
multiple
tours
of
duty
far
from
families
who
bore
heroic
burden
of
their
own
enduring
the
absence
of
embrace
or
kiss
most
painfully
since
the
war
began
members
of
the
fourth
brigade
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
part
of
over
americans
who
have
given
their
lives
in
iraq
as
one
staff
sergeant
said
know
that
to
my
brothers
in
arms
who
fought
and
died
this
day
would
probably
mean
those
americans
gave
their
lives
for
the
values
that
have
lived
in
the
hearts
of
our
people
for
over
two
centuries
along
with
nearly
million
americans
who
have
served
in
iraq
they
fought
in
faraway
place
for
people
they
never
knew
they
stared
into
the
darkest
of
human
creations
war
and
helped
the
iraqi
people
seek
the
light
of
peace
in
an
age
without
surrender
ceremonies
we
must
earn
victory
through
the
success
of
our
partners
and
the
strength
of
our
own
nation
every
american
who
serves
joins
an
unbroken
line
of
that
stretches
from
to
from
to
from
to
americans
who
have
fought
to
see
that
the
lives
of
our
children
are
better
than
our
own
our
troops
are
the
steel
in
our
ship
of
state
and
though
our
nation
may
be
travelling
through
rough
waters
they
give
us
confidence
that
our
course
is
true
and
that
beyond
the
darkness
better
days
lie
ahead
thank
you
may
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
and
all
who
serve
her
well
welcome
to
the
white
house
to
you
to
muslim
americans
across
our
country
and
to
more
than
one
billion
muslims
around
the
world
extend
my
best
wishes
on
this
holy
month
want
to
welcome
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
members
of
my
administration
and
members
of
congress
including
rush
john
and
who
is
one
of
two
muslim
american
members
of
congress
along
with
so
welcome
all
of
you
here
at
the
white
house
we
have
tradition
of
hosting
that
goes
back
several
years
just
as
we
host
parties
and
and
celebrations
and
these
events
celebrate
the
role
of
faith
in
the
lives
of
the
american
people
they
remind
us
of
the
basic
truth
that
we
are
all
children
of
god
and
we
all
draw
strength
and
sense
of
purpose
from
our
beliefs
these
events
are
also
an
affirmation
of
who
we
are
as
americans
our
founders
understood
that
the
best
way
to
the
place
of
faith
in
the
lives
of
our
people
was
to
protect
their
freedom
to
practice
religion
in
the
virginia
act
of
establishing
religion
freedom
thomas
wrote
that
men
shall
be
free
to
profess
and
by
argument
to
maintain
their
opinions
in
matters
of
the
first
amendment
of
our
constitution
established
the
freedom
of
religion
as
the
law
of
the
land
and
that
right
has
been
upheld
ever
since
indeed
over
the
course
of
our
history
religion
has
flourished
within
our
borders
precisely
because
americans
have
had
the
right
to
worship
as
they
choose
including
the
right
to
believe
in
no
religion
at
all
and
it
is
testament
to
the
wisdom
of
our
founders
that
america
remains
deeply
religious
nation
where
the
ability
of
peoples
of
different
faiths
to
coexist
peacefully
and
with
mutual
respect
for
one
another
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
religious
conflict
that
persists
elsewhere
around
the
globe
now
that
not
to
say
that
religion
is
without
controversy
recently
attention
has
been
focused
on
the
construction
of
mosques
in
certain
communities
particularly
new
york
now
we
must
all
and
respect
the
sensitivities
surrounding
the
development
of
lower
the
attacks
were
deeply
traumatic
event
for
our
country
and
the
pain
and
the
experience
of
suffering
by
those
who
lost
loved
ones
is
just
unimaginable
so
understand
the
emotions
that
this
issue
engenders
and
ground
zero
is
indeed
hallowed
ground
but
let
me
be
clear
as
citizen
and
as
president
believe
that
muslims
have
the
same
right
to
practice
their
religion
as
everyone
else
in
this
country
and
that
includes
the
right
to
build
place
of
worship
and
community
on
private
property
in
lower
in
accordance
with
local
laws
and
ordinances
this
is
america
and
our
commitment
to
religious
freedom
must
be
unshakeable
the
principle
that
people
of
all
faiths
are
welcome
in
this
country
and
that
they
will
not
be
treated
differently
by
their
government
is
essential
to
who
we
are
the
writ
of
the
founders
must
endure
we
must
never
forget
those
who
we
lost
so
tragically
on
and
we
must
always
those
who
led
the
response
to
that
attack
from
the
firefighters
who
charged
up
staircases
to
our
troops
who
are
serving
in
today
and
let
us
also
remember
who
fighting
against
and
what
fighting
for
our
enemies
respect
no
religious
freedom
cause
is
not
islam
gross
distortion
of
islam
these
are
not
religious
leaders
terrorists
who
murder
innocent
men
and
women
and
children
in
fact
has
killed
more
muslims
than
people
of
any
other
religion
and
that
list
of
victims
includes
innocent
muslims
who
were
killed
on
so
that
who
fighting
against
and
the
reason
that
we
will
win
this
fight
is
not
simply
the
strength
of
our
arms
it
is
the
strength
of
our
values
the
democracy
that
we
uphold
the
freedoms
that
we
cherish
the
laws
that
we
apply
without
regard
to
race
or
religion
or
wealth
or
status
our
capacity
to
show
not
merely
tolerance
but
respect
towards
those
who
are
different
from
us
and
that
way
of
life
that
quintessentially
american
creed
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
nihilism
of
those
who
attacked
us
on
that
september
morning
and
who
continue
to
plot
against
us
today
in
my
inaugural
address
said
that
our
patchwork
heritage
is
strength
not
weakness
we
are
nation
of
and
muslims
jews
and
and
we
are
shaped
by
every
language
and
every
culture
drawn
from
every
end
of
this
earth
and
that
diversity
can
bring
difficult
debates
this
is
not
unique
to
our
time
past
eras
have
seen
controversies
about
the
construction
of
synagogues
or
catholic
churches
but
time
and
again
the
american
people
have
demonstrated
that
we
can
work
through
these
issues
and
stay
true
to
our
core
values
and
emerge
stronger
for
it
so
it
must
be
and
will
be
today
and
tonight
we
are
reminded
that
is
celebration
of
faith
known
for
great
diversity
and
is
reminder
that
islam
has
always
been
part
of
america
the
first
muslim
ambassador
to
the
united
states
from
tunisia
was
hosted
by
president
who
arranged
sunset
dinner
for
his
guest
because
it
was
making
it
the
first
known
at
the
white
house
more
than
years
ago
like
so
many
other
immigrants
generations
of
muslims
came
to
forge
their
future
here
they
became
farmers
and
merchants
worked
in
mills
and
factories
they
helped
lay
the
they
helped
to
build
america
they
founded
the
first
islamic
in
new
york
city
in
the
they
built
first
mosque
on
the
prairie
of
north
and
perhaps
the
oldest
surviving
mosque
in
america
still
in
use
today
is
in
cedar
rapids
today
our
nation
is
strengthened
by
millions
of
muslim
americans
they
excel
in
every
walk
of
life
muslim
american
communities
including
mosques
in
all
states
also
serve
their
muslim
americans
protect
our
communities
as
police
officers
and
firefighters
and
first
responders
muslim
american
clerics
have
spoken
out
against
terror
and
extremism
reaffirming
that
islam
teaches
that
one
must
save
human
life
not
take
it
and
muslim
americans
serve
with
in
our
military
at
next
at
the
pentagon
tribute
will
be
paid
to
three
soldiers
who
gave
their
lives
in
iraq
and
now
rest
among
the
of
national
cemetery
these
muslim
americans
died
for
the
security
that
we
depend
on
and
the
freedoms
that
we
cherish
they
are
part
of
an
unbroken
line
of
americans
that
stretches
back
to
our
founding
americans
of
all
faiths
who
have
served
and
sacrificed
to
extend
the
promise
of
america
to
new
generations
and
to
ensure
that
what
is
exceptional
about
america
is
protected
our
commitment
to
stay
true
to
our
core
values
and
our
ability
slowly
but
surely
to
perfect
our
union
for
in
the
end
we
remain
nation
under
god
and
we
can
only
achieve
and
justice
for
if
we
live
by
that
one
rule
at
the
heart
of
every
great
religion
including
islam

unto
others

to
answer
that
call
has
done
so
with

many
of
you
served
in
the

also
served
with
exemplary
dedication
and
courage
but
were
often
shunned
when

national
disgrace

it
must
never
happen
again
and
that
why
we
making
sure
our
veterans

an
unbroken
line

the
beginning
of
another
battle
the
battle
to

stand

and
to
walk

and
to
work
again
you
fought
for
each

and
for
the
benefits
and
treatment
you
had
earned
you
became
leaders
in
our
communities
in
our
companies
and
our
country
including
former
vet
and
senator
who
reminded
us
that
america
disabled
veterans
are
strong
at
the
broken
places
today
your
legacy
of
service
is
carried
on
by
new
generation
of
americans
some
stepped
forward
in
time
of
peace
not
foreseeing
years
of
combat
others
stepped
forward
in
this
time
of
war
knowing
they
could
be
sent
into
harm
way
for
the
past
nine
years
in
and
iraq
they
have
borne
the
burdens
of
war
they
and
their
families
have
faced
the
greatest
test
in
the
history
of
our
force
serving
tour
after
tour
year
after
year
through
their
extraordinary
service
they
have
written
their
own
chapter
in
the
american
story
and
by
any
measure
they
have
earned
their
place
among
the
greatest
of
generations
now
one
of
those
chapters
is
nearing
an
end
as
candidate
for
president
pledged
to
bring
the
war
in
iraq
to
responsible
end
shortly
after
taking
office
announced
our
new
strategy
for
iraq
and
for
transition
to
full
iraqi
responsibility
and
made
it
clear
that
by
august
america
combat
mission
in
iraq
would
end
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
doing
as
promised
and
on
schedule
already
we
have
closed
or
turned
over
to
iraq
hundreds
of
bases
we
moving
out
millions
of
pieces
of
equipment
in
one
of
the
largest
logistics
operations
that
we
seen
in
decades
by
the
end
of
this
month
we
have
brought
more
than
of
our
troops
home
from
iraq
since
took
office
more
than
have
come
home
today
even
as
terrorists
try
to
derail
iraq
progress
because
of
the
sacrifices
of
our
troops
and
their
iraqi
partners
violence
in
iraq
continues
to
be
near
the
lowest
it
been
in
years
and
next
month
we
will
change
our
military
mission
from
combat
to
supporting
and
training
iraqi
security
forces
in
fact
in
many
parts
of
the
country
iraqis
have
already
taken
the
lead
for
security
as
agreed
to
with
the
iraqi
government
we
will
maintain
transitional
force
until
we
remove
all
our
troops
from
iraq
by
the
end
of
next
year
and
during
this
period
our
forces
will
have
focused
mission
supporting
and
training
iraqi
forces
partnering
with
iraqis
in
missions
and
protecting
our
civilian
and
military
efforts
these
are
dangerous
tasks
there
are
still
those
with
bombs
and
bullets
who
will
try
to
stop
iraq
progress
and
the
hard
truth
is
we
have
not
seen
the
end
of
american
sacrifice
in
iraq
but
make
no
mistake
our
commitment
in
iraq
is
changing
from
military
effort
led
by
our
troops
to
civilian
effort
led
by
our
diplomats
and
as
we
mark
the
end
of
america
combat
mission
in
iraq
grateful
america
must
pay
tribute
to
all
who
served
there
remember
our
nation
has
had
vigorous
debates
about
the
iraq
war
there
are
patriots
who
supported
going
to
war
and
patriots
who
opposed
it
but
there
has
never
been
any
daylight
between
us
when
it
comes
to
supporting
the
more
than
one
million
americans
in
uniform
who
have
served
in
iraq
far
more
than
any
conflict
since
these
men
and
women
from
across
our
country
have
done
more
than
meet
the
challenges
of
this
young
century
through
their
extraordinary
courage
and
confidence
and
commitment
these
troops
and
veterans
have
proven
themselves
as
new
generation
of
american
leaders
and
while
our
country
has
sometimes
been
divided
they
have
fought
together
as
one
while
other
individuals
and
institutions
have
shirked
responsibility
they
have
welcomed
responsibility
while
it
was
easy
to
be
daunted
by
overwhelming
challenges
the
generation
that
has
served
in
iraq
has
overcome
every
test
before
them
they
took
to
the
skies
and
sped
across
deserts
in
the
initial
charge
into
baghdad
and
today
we
joined
by
an
infantryman
who
was
there
as
part
of
the
airborne
division
sergeant
is
here
when
invasion
gave
way
to
insurgency
our
troops
persevered
block
by
block
city
by
city
from
baghdad
to
as
driver
in
transportation
company
this
soldier
endured
constant
attacks
but
never
in
his
mission
and
we
thank
sergeant
dan
thank
you
dan
when
terrorists
and
militias
plunged
iraq
into
sectarian
war
our
troops
adapted
and
adjusted
restoring
order
and
effectively
defeating
in
iraq
on
the
battlefield
and
among
those
who
served
in
those
pivotal
days
was
scout
with
the
cavalry
division
specialist
matt
matt
for
each
of
these
men
and
women
there
are
countless
others
and
we
them
all
our
young
enlisted
troops
and
officers
who
are
the
backbone
of
our
military
the
national
guardsmen
and
reservists
who
served
in
unprecedented
deployments
more
women
tested
by
combat
than
in
any
war
in
american
history
including
marine
here
today
sergeant
teased
said
she
looks
like
she
still
in
high
school
but
she
marine
and
we
salute
the
families
back
home
they
too
have
sacrificed
in
this
war
that
why
my
wife
and
the
vice
president
wife
have
made
it
their
mission
to
make
sure
america
takes
care
of
our
remarkable
military
families
including
our
veterans
now
this
summer
tens
of
thousands
of
our
troops
in
iraq
are
coming
home
last
week
vice
president
was
at
fort
drum
to
help
welcome
back
members
of
the
legendary
mountain
division
families
are
being
reunited
at
bases
across
the
country
from
fort
in
north
to
fort
in
to
fort
in
washington
and
in
this
season
of
homecomings
every
american
can
show
their
gratitude
to
our
patriots
who
served
in
iraq
as
we
do
we
are
humbled
by
the
profound
sacrifice
that
has
been
rendered
each
of
the
veterans
have
mentioned
carried
with
them
the
wounds
of
this
war
and
as
nation
we
will
forever
all
who
gave
their
lives
that
last
true
measure
of
devotion
in
service
in
iraq
soldiers
sailors
airmen
marines
coast
guardsmen
active
guard
reserve
even
as
we
end
the
war
in
iraq
even
as
we
welcome
home
so
many
of
our
troops
others
are
still
deployed
in
so
want
to
remind
everyone
it
was
where
plotted
and
trained
to
murder
innocent
people
on
it
is
and
the
tribal
regions
of
pakistan
where
terrorists
have
launched
other
attacks
against
us
and
our
allies
and
if
were
to
be
engulfed
by
an
even
wider
insurgency
and
its
terrorist
affiliates
would
have
even
more
space
to
plan
their
next
attack
and
as
president
of
the
united
states
refuse
to
let
that
happen
the
effort
in
has
been
long
and
been
difficult
and
that
why
after
years
in
which
the
situation
had
deteriorated
announced
new
strategy
last
december
military
effort
to
break
the
momentum
and
train
afghan
forces
so
that
they
can
take
the
lead
for
their
security
and
civilian
effort
to
promote
good
governance
and
development
that
improves
the
lives
of
the
afghan
people
and
deeper
cooperation
with
pakistan
to
root
out
terrorists
on
both
sides
of
the
border
we
will
continue
to
face
huge
challenges
in
but
it
important
that
the
american
people
know
that
we
are
making
progress
and
we
are
focused
on
goals
that
are
clear
and
achievable
on
the
military
front
nearly
all
the
additional
forces
that
ordered
to
are
now
in
place
along
with
our
afghan
and
international
partners
we
are
going
on
the
offensive
against
the
targeting
their
leaders
challenging
them
in
regions
where
they
had
free
reign
and
training
afghan
national
security
forces
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
all
our
troops
risking
their
lives
for
our
safety
in
and
on
the
civilian
front
we
insisting
on
greater
accountability
and
the
afghan
government
has
taken
concrete
steps
to
foster
development
and
combat
corruption
and
to
put
forward
reintegration
plan
that
allows
afghans
to
lay
down
their
arms
in
pakistan
we
seen
the
government
begin
to
take
the
fight
to
violent
extremists
within
its
borders
and
major
blows
have
been
struck
against
and
its
leadership
because
in
this
region
and
beyond
we
will
tolerate
no
safe
haven
for
and
their
extremist
allies
we
will
disrupt
we
will
dismantle
and
we
will
ultimately
defeat
and
we
will
give
our
troops
the
resources
and
the
equipment
to
get
the
job
done
and
keep
our
country
safe
at
the
same
time
every
american
who
has
ever
worn
the
uniform
must
also
know
this
your
country
is
going
to
take
care
of
you
when
you
come
home
our
nation
commitment
to
our
veterans
to
you
and
your
families
is
sacred
trust
and
to
me
and
my
administration
upholding
that
trust
is
moral
obligation
it
not
just
politics
that
why
charged
secretary
with
building
century
and
that
includes
one
of
the
largest
percentage
increases
to
the
budget
in
the
past
years
we
are
going
to
cut
this
deficit
that
we
got
and
proposed
freeze
on
discretionary
domestic
spending
but
what
have
not
frozen
is
the
spending
we
need
to
keep
our
military
strong
our
country
safe
and
our
veterans
secure
so
we
going
to
keep
on
making
historic
commitments
to
our
veterans
for
about
vets
who
may
have
been
exposed
to
agent
orange
and
who
now
suffer
from
three
chronic
diseases
we
making
it
easier
for
you
to
get
the
health
care
and
benefits
you
need
for
our
gulf
war
veterans
we
declared
that
nine
infectious
diseases
are
now
presumed
to
be
related
to
your
service
in
desert
storm
for
our
disabled
veterans
we
eliminated
for
those
of
you
who
are
catastrophically
disabled
we
kept
our
promise
on
concurrent
receipt
by
proposing
legislation
that
would
allow
severely
disabled
to
receive
your
military
retired
pay
and
your
disability
benefits
it
the
right
thing
to
do
we
dramatically
increased
funding
for
veterans
health
care
across
the
board
and
that
includes
improving
care
for
rural
veterans
and
women
veterans
for
those
vets
who
had
lost
their
eligibility
our
priority
veterans
we
restoring
your
access
to
health
care
and
since
the
continue
to
fly
even
though
they
are
wrong
let
me
say
it
as
clearly
as
can
the
historic
health
care
reform
legislation
that
signed
into
law
does
not
repeat
does
not
change
your
veterans
benefits
the
health
care
benefits
that
you
know
and
trust
are
safe
and
that
includes
for
our
disabled
veterans
thanks
to
advanced
appropriations
the
delays
for
funding
for
veterans
medical
care
are
over
and
just
as
those
delays
were
unacceptable
so
too
are
long
delays
in
the
claims
process
so
secretary
is
working
overtime
to
create
single
lifetime
electronic
record
that
our
troops
and
veterans
can
keep
for
life
and
today
today
can
announce
that
for
the
first
time
ever
veterans
will
be
able
to
go
to
the
website
click
simple
blue
button
and
download
or
print
your
personal
health
records
so
you
have
them
when
you
need
them
and
can
share
them
with
your
doctors
outside
of
the
that
happening
this
fall
we
hiring
thousands
of
new
claims
processors
to
break
the
backlog
once
and
for
all
and
to
make
sure
the
backlog
does
come
back
we
reforming
the
claims
process
itself
with
new
information
technologies
and
paperless
system
we
got
an
amen
over
here
as
result
of
the
innovation
competition
that
announced
last
summer
our
dedicated
employees
suggested
more
than
new
ways
to
cut
through
the
red
tape
and
the
bureaucracy
and
we
already
putting
dozens
of
these
innovative
ideas
into
action
additionally
we
enabling
more
veterans
to
check
the
status
of
their
claims
and
from
their
cell
phone
as
next
step
we
opening
this
competition
to
entrepreneurs
and
academics
so
the
best
minds
in
america
can
help
us
develop
the
technologies
to
serve
our
vets
including
those
of
you
with
multiple
traumatic
injuries
and
we
going
to
keep
at
this
until
we
meet
our
commitment
to
cut
those
backlogs

those
wait
times
and
deliver
your
benefits
sooner
this
is
priority
and
we
are
going
to
get
it
done
we
making
progress
in
ending
homelessness
among
our
veterans
today
on
any
given
night
there
are
about
fewer
veterans
on
the
streets
than
there
were
when
we
took
office
but
we
not
going
to
be
satisfied
until
every
veteran
who
has
fought
for
america
has
home
in
america
we
will
not
stop
finally
we
keeping
faith
with
our
newest
veterans
returning
from
and
iraq
we
offering
more
of
the
support
and
they
need
to
transition
back
to
civilian
life
that
includes
funding
the
bill
which
is
already
helping
more
than
veterans
and
family
members
pursue
their
dream
of
college
education
and
for
veterans
trying
to
find
work
in
very
tough
economy
we
helping
with
job
training
and
placement
and
directed
the
federal
government
to
make
it
priority
to
hire
more
veterans
including
disabled
veterans
and
every
business
in
america
needs
to
know
our
vets
have
the
training
they
got
the
skills
they
have
the
dedication
they
are
ready
to
work
and
our
country
is
stronger
when
we
tap
the
incredible
talents
of
our
veterans
for
those
coming
home

we
continuing
to
direct
unprecedented
support
to
our
wounded
warriors

those
who
can
we
want
to
help
them

back
to
where
they
want
to

their
units

so
much
to
offer
our
military
we
directing
unprecedented
resources
to
treating
the
signature
wounds
of
today

injury
and
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
and
recently
signed
into
law
the
and
veterans
omnibus
health
services
act
that
long
name
but
let
me
tell
you
what
it
does
it
not
only
improves
treatment
for
traumatic
brain
injury
and
it
gives
new
support
to
many
of
the
who
put
their
own
lives
on
hold
to
care
for
their
loved
one
and
as
so
many
of
you
know
is
pain
like
no
other
the
nightmares
that
keep
coming
back
the
rage
that
strikes
suddenly
the
hopelessness
that
led
too
many
of
our
troops
and
veterans
to
take
their
own
lives
so
today
want
to
say
in
very
personal
terms
to
anyone
who
is
struggling
do
suffer
in
silence
it
not
sign
of
weakness
to
reach
out
for
support

sign
of
strength

country

are
here
for
you
we
are
here
to
help
you

major
investments
in
awareness
outreach
and
suicide
prevention

more
mental
health
professionals

care
and
treatment
for
those
of
you
suffering
from
we
making
it
whole
lot
easier
to
qualify
for
benefits
from
now
on
if
doctor
confirms
diagnosis
of
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
that
is
enough
no
matter
what
war
you
served
in
these
are
the
commitments
my
administration
has
made
these
are
the
promises
we
worked
to
keep
this
is
the
sacred
trust
we
have
pledged
to
uphold
to
you
and
all
who
serve
want
to
make
special
mention
of
truly
inspiring
american
staff
sergeant
he
was
at
during
one
of
my
periodic
visits
to
see
our
wounded
warriors
and
as
walked
into
his
room
saw
picture
on
the
wall
and
it
was
picture
of
the
two
of
us
together
see
had
met
before
back
at
the
anniversary
in
normandy
good
looking
young
man
proud
army
ranger
he
had
joined
in
of
that
historic
paratroop
jump
then
soon
after
served
on
his
deployment
since
that
right
his
deployment
and
that
when
an
nearly
took
his
life
the
traumatic
brain
injury
was
severe
was
in
coma
for
months
it
seemed
possible
that
he
would
never
wake
up
but
then
something
happened
his
doctors
still
explain
it
his
parents
called
it
miracle
opened
one
of
his
eyes
then
few
weeks
later
he
moved
leg
then
he
moved
an
arm
and
there
at
we
were
meeting
again
and
still
could
speak
but
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
he
lifted
his
arm
and
he
shook
my
hand
firmly
and
when
asked
how
he
was
feeling
he
held
up
his
hand
pulled
his
fingers
together
and
gave
thumbs
up
today
is
at
hospital
in
florida
and
with
the
support
of
his
family
and
staff
he
working
hard
every
day
to
regain
his
strength
he
got
to
learn
to
speak
all
over
again
he
grateful
for
the
visits
he
received
from
friends
and
supporters
including
the
disabled
american
veterans
and
is
only
years
old
he
knows
he
got
long
and
very
hard
road
ahead
but
he
pushes
on
and
he
determined
to
get
back
to
his
fellow
rangers
and
when
someone
at
the
hospital
said
you
going
to
walk
out
of
here
someday
he
said
no
going
to
run
out
of
here
so
to
staff
sergeant
to
the
disabled
american
veterans
want
to
say
to
all
of
you
you
are
the
very
essence
of
america
the
values
that
sustain
us
as
people
and
the
virtues
our
nation
needs
most
right
now
and
the
resilience
that
in
the
face
of
great
loss
so
many
of
you
experienced
know
you
like
know
what
it
means
to
pick
yourselves
up
and
keep
pushing
on
and
that
sense
of
purpose
that
tells
us
to
carry
on
not
just
when
it
easy
but
when
it
hard
even
when
the
odds
seem
overwhelming
that
what
we
about
the
confidence
that
our
destiny
is
never
written
for
us
it
written
by
us
the
faith
that
fundamental
american
faith
that
there
are
always
brighter
days
ahead
and
that
we
not
will
not
simply
endure
but
we
will
emerge
from
our
tests
and
trials
and
tribulations
stronger
than
before
that
is
your
story
that
is
america
story
and
proud
to
stand
with
you
as
we
write
the
next
proud
chapter
in
the
life
of
the
country
we
love
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
everybody
please
have
seat
have
seat
well
good
morning
everyone
we
are
gathered
in
the
heart
of
our
capital
surrounded
by
memorials
to
leaders
and
citizens
who
served
our
nation
in
its
earliest
days
and
in
its
days
of
greatest
trial
today
is
such
time
for
america
over
the
past
two
years
we
have
faced
the
worst
recession
since
the
great
depression
eight
million
people
lost
their
jobs
tens
of
millions
saw
the
value
of
their
homes
and
retirement
savings
plummet
countless
businesses
have
been
unable
to
get
the
loans
they
need
and
many
have
been
forced
to
shut
their
doors
and
although
the
economy
is
growing
again
too
many
people
are
still
feeling
the
pain
of
the
downturn
now
while
number
of
factors
led
to
such
severe
recession
the
primary
cause
was
breakdown
in
our
financial
system
it
was
crisis
born
of
failure
of
responsibility
from
certain
corners
of
wall
street
to
the
halls
of
power
in
washington
for
years
our
financial
sector
was
governed
by
antiquated
and
poorly
enforced
rules
that
allowed
some
to
game
the
system
and
take
risks
that
endangered
the
entire
economy
unscrupulous
lenders
locked
consumers
into
complex
loans
with
hidden
costs
firms
like
placed
massive
risky
bets
with
borrowed
money
and
while
the
rules
left
abuse
and
excess
unchecked
they
also
left
taxpayers
on
the
hook
if
big
bank
or
financial
institution
ever
failed
now
even
before
the
crisis
hit
went
to
wall
street
and
called
for
reforms
to
protect
consumers
and
our
economy
as
whole
and
soon
after
taking
office
proposed
set
of
reforms
to
empower
consumers
and
investors
to
bring
the
shadowy
deals
that
caused
this
crisis
into
the
light
of
day
and
to
put
stop
to
taxpayer
once
and
for
all
today
thanks
to
lot
of
people
in
this
room
those
reforms
will
become
the
law
of
the
land
for
the
last
year
chairmen
frank
and
have
worked
day
and
night
and
have
worked
day
and
night
to
bring
about
this
reform
and
am
profoundly
grateful
to
them
would
be
remiss
if
did
also
express
my
appreciation
to
senator
harry
and
speaker
for
their
leadership
it
have
happened
without
them
passing
this
bill
was
no
easy
task
to
get
there
we
had
to
overcome
the
furious
lobbying
of
an
array
of
powerful
interest
groups
and
partisan
minority
determined
to
block
change
so
the
members
who
are
here
today
both
on
the
stage
and
in
the
audience
they
have
done
great
service
in
devoting
so
much
time
and
expertise
to
this
effort
to
looking
out
for
the
public
interests
and
not
the
special
interests
and
also
want
to
thank
the
three
republican
senators
who
put
partisanship
aside
judged
this
bill
on
the
merits
and
voted
for
reform
grateful
to
them
and
the
republican
house
members
good
to
see
you
now
put
this
in
perspective
the
fact
is
the
financial
industry
is
central
to
our
ability
to
grow
to
prosper
to
compete
and
to
innovate
there
are
lot
of
banks
that
understand
and
this
vital
role
and
there
are
whole
lot
of
bankers
who
want
to
do
right
and
do
right
by
their
customers
this
reform
will
help
foster
innovation
not
hamper
it
it
is
designed
to
make
sure
that
everybody
follows
the
same
set
of
rules
so
that
firms
compete
on
price
and
quality
not
on
tricks
and
not
on
traps
it
demands
accountability
and
responsibility
from
everyone
it
provides
certainty
to
everybody
from
bankers
to
farmers
to
business
owners
to
consumers
and
unless
your
business
model
depends
on
cutting
corners
or
your
customers
got
nothing
to
fear
from
reform
now
for
all
those
americans
who
are
wondering
what
wall
street
reform
means
for
you
what
you
can
expect
if
ever
applied
for
credit
card
student
loan
or
mortgage
you
know
the
feeling
of
signing
your
name
to
pages
of
barely
understandable
fine
print
what
often
happens
as
result
is
that
many
americans
are
caught
by
hidden
fees
and
penalties
or
saddled
with
loans
they
afford
what
happened
to
robin
fox
hit
with
massive
rate
increase
on
her
credit
card
balance
even
though
she
paid
her
bills
on
time
what
happened
to
andrew
who
discovered
hundreds
of
dollars
in
overdraft
fees
on
his
bank
statement
fees
he
had
no
idea
he
might
face
both
are
here
today
well
with
this
law
unfair
rate
hikes
like
the
one
that
hit
robin
will
end
for
good
and
ensure
that
people
like
andrew
unwittingly
caught
by
overdraft
fees
when
they
sign
up
for
checking
account
with
this
law
crack
down
on
abusive
practices
in
the
mortgage
industry
make
sure
that
contracts
are
simpler
putting
an
end
to
many
hidden
penalties
and
fees
in
complex
mortgages
so
folks
know
what
signing
with
this
law
students
who
take
out
college
loans
will
be
provided
clear
and
concise
information
about
their
obligations
and
with
this
law
ordinary
investors
like
seniors
and
folks
saving
for
retirement
will
be
able
to
receive
more
information
about
the
costs
and
risks
of
mutual
funds
and
other
investment
products
so
that
they
can
make
better
financial
decisions
as
to
what
will
work
for
them
so
all
told
these
reforms
represent
the
strongest
consumer
financial
protections
in
history
in
history
and
these
protections
will
be
enforced
by
new
consumer
watchdog
with
just
one
job
looking
out
for
people
not
big
banks
not
lenders
not
investment
houses
looking
out
for
people
as
they
interact
with
the
financial
system
and
not
just
good
for
consumers
good
for
the
economy
because
reform
will
put
stop
to
lot
of
the
bad
loans
that
bubble
and
it
will
mean
all
companies
will
have
to
seek
customers
by
offering
better
products
instead
of
more
deceptive
ones
now
beyond
the
consumer
protections
outlined
reform
will
also
rein
in
the
abuse
and
excess
that
nearly
brought
down
our
financial
system
it
will
finally
bring
transparency
to
the
kinds
of
complex
and
risky
transactions
that
helped
trigger
the
financial
crisis
shareholders
will
also
have
greater
say
on
the
pay
of
and
other
executives
so
they
can
reward
success
instead
of
failure
and
finally
because
of
this
law
the
american
people
will
never
again
be
asked
to
foot
the
bill
for
wall
mistakes
there
will
be
no
more
period
if
large
financial
institution
should
ever
fail
this
reform
gives
us
the
ability
to
wind
it
down
without
endangering
the
broader
economy
and
there
will
be
new
rules
to
make
clear
that
no
firm
is
somehow
protected
because
it
is
big
to
fail
so
we
have
another
that
what
this
reform
will
mean
now
it
mean
our
work
is
over
for
these
new
rules
to
be
effective
regulators
will
have
to
be
vigilant
we
may
need
to
make
adjustments
along
the
way
as
our
financial
system
adapts
to
these
new
changes
and
changes
around
the
globe
no
law
can
force
anybody
to
be
responsible
still
incumbent
on
those
on
wall
street
to
heed
the
lessons
of
this
crisis
in
terms
of
how
they
conduct
their
businesses
the
fact
is
every
american
from
main
street
to
wall
street
has
stake
in
our
financial
system
wall
street
banks
and
firms
invest
the
capital
that
makes
it
possible
for
to
sell
new
products
they
provide
loans
to
businesses
to
expand
and
to
hire
they
back
mortgages
for
families
purchasing
new
home
why
all
stand
to
gain
from
these
reforms
we
all
win
when
investors
around
the
world
have
confidence
in
our
markets
we
all
win
when
shareholders
have
more
power
and
more
information
we
all
win
when
consumers
are
protected
against
abuse
and
we
all
win
when
folks
are
rewarded
based
on
how
well
they
perform
not
how
well
they
evade
accountability
in
the
end
our
financial
system
only
works
our
market
is
only
free
when
there
are
clear
rules
and
basic
safeguards
that
prevent
abuse
that
check
excess
that
ensure
that
it
is
more
profitable
to
play
by
the
rules
than
to
game
the
system
and
what
these
reforms
are
designed
to
achieve
no
more
no
less
because
how
we
will
ensure
that
our
economy
works
for
consumers
that
it
works
for
investors
that
it
works
for
financial
institutions
that
it
works
for
all
of
us
this
is
the
central
lesson
not
only
of
this
crisis
but
of
our
history
ultimately
no
dividing
line
between
main
street
and
wall
street
we
rise
or
fall
together
as
one
nation
so
these
reforms
will
help
lift
our
economy
and
lead
all
of
us
to
stronger
more
prosperous
future
and
why
so
to
sign
these
reforms
into
law
and
so
grateful
to
everybody
who
worked
so
hard
to
make
this
day
possible
thank
you
very
much
everybody
to
and
and
to
senator
entire
family
including
those
adorable
great
granddaughters
that
had
chance
to
meet
and
offer
you
our
deepest
sympathies
to
senator

including
the
speaker
of
the
house

republican
leader

president

the
previous
speakers
senator

the
outstanding
work
that
done
for
the
state
of
west
virginia
to
his
larger
family
the
people
of
west
virginia
want
you
all
to
know
that
all
america
shares
your
loss
may
we
all
find
comfort
in
verse
of
scripture
that
reminds
me
of
our
dear
friend
time
of
my
departure
has
come
have
fought
the
good
fight
have
finished
the
race
have
kept
the
interesting
that
heard
that
passage
from
several
speakers
now
because
it
embodies
somebody
who
knew
how
to
run
good
and
long
race
and
somebody
who
knew
how
to
keep
the
faith
with
his
state
with
his
family
with
his
country
and
his
constitution
years
from
now
when
think
of
the
man
we
today
remember
him
as
he
was
when
came
to
know
him
his
white
hair
full
like
mane
his
gait
steadied
with
cane
determined
to
make
the
most
of
every
last
breath
the
distinguished
gentleman
from
west
virginia
could
be
found
at
his
desk
until
the
very
end
doing
the
business
delivering
speeches
hint
of
the
in
his
voice
stabbing
the
air
with
his
finger
fiery
as
ever
years
into
his
decade
he
was
senate
icon
he
was
party
leader
he
was
an
elder
statesman
and
he
was
my
friend
how
remember
him
today
we
remember
the
path
he
climbed
to
such
extraordinary
peaks
born
calvin
sale
corny
he
joked
for
short
his
mother
lost
her
life
in
the
great
influenza
pandemic
of
from
the
aunt
and
uncle
who
raised
him
amid
west
coal
camps
he
gained
not
only
his
name
but
reverence
for
god
almighty
love
of
learning
that
was
nurtured
at
mark
twain
school
and
there
he
met
his
sweetheart
for
over
years
by
whose
side
he
will
now
rest
for
eternity
unable
to
afford
college
he
did
what
he
could
to
get
by
finding
work
as
gas
station
attendant
produce
salesman
and
welder
in
the
shipyards
of
and
during
world
war
returning
home
to
west
virginia
after
the
war
he
ran
for
the
state
house
of
delegates
using
his
fiddle
case
as
briefcase
the
better
to
stand
out
on
the
stump
before
long
he
ran
for
congress
serving
in
the
house
before
jumping
over
to
the
senate
where
he
was
elected
nine
times
held
almost
every
leadership
role
imaginable
and
proved
as
capable
of
swaying
others
as
standing
alone
marking
row
of
milestones
along
the
way
member
of
congress
nearly
votes
cast
not
single
loss
at
the
polls
record
that
speaks
to
the
bond
that
he
had
with
you
the
people
of
his
state
transplanted
to
washington
his
heart
remained
here
in
west
virginia
in
the
place
that
shaped
him
with
the
people
he
loved
his
heart
belonged
to
you
making
life
better
here
was
his
only
agenda
giving
you
hope
he
said
was
his
greatest
achievement
hope
in
the
form
of
new
jobs
and
industries
hope
in
the
form
of
black
lung
benefits
and
union
protections
hope
through
roads
and
research
schools
and
scholarships
health
clinics
and
industrial
parks
that
bear
his
name
his
early
rival
and
late
friend
ted
kennedy
used
to
joke
about
campaigning
in
west
virginia
when
his
bus
broke
down
ted
got
hold
of
the
highway
patrol
who
asked
where
he
was
and
he
said
on
and
the
dispatcher
said
one
life
that
immeasurably
improved
the
lives
of
west
of
course
was
deeply
religious
man
christian
and
so
he
understood
that
our
lives
are
marked
by
sins
as
well
as
virtues
failures
as
well
as
success
weakness
as
well
as
strength
we
know
there
are
things
he
said
and
things
he
did
that
he
came
to
regret
remember
talking
about
that
the
first
time
visited
with
him
he
said
are
things
regretted
in
my
youth
you
may
know
and
said
of
us
are
absent
some
regrets
senator
why
we
enjoy
and
seek
the
grace
of
and
as
reflect
on
the
full
sweep
of
his
years
it
seems
to
me
that
his
life
bent
towards
justice
like
the
constitution
he
tucked
in
his
pocket
like
our
nation
itself
possessed
that
quintessential
american
quality
and
that
is
capacity
to
change
capacity
to
learn
capacity
to
listen
capacity
to
be
made
more
perfect
over
his
nearly
six
decades
in
our
capitol
he
came
to
be
seen
as
the
very
embodiment
of
the
senate
chronicling
its
history
in
four
volumes
that
he
gave
to
me
just
as
he
gave
to
president
too
read
it
was
scared
he
was
going
to
quiz
me
but
as
soon
discovered
his
passion
for
the
past
his
mastery
of
even
its
most
arcane
procedures
it
an
obsession
with
the
trivial
or
the
obscure
it
reflected
profoundly
noble
impulse
recognition
of
basic
truth
about
this
country
that
we
are
not
nation
of
men
we
are
nation
of
laws
our
way
of
life
rests
on
our
democratic
institutions
precisely
because
we
are
fallible
it
falls
to
each
of
us
to
safeguard
these
institutions
even
when
inconvenient
and
pass
on
our
republic
more
perfect
than
before
considering
the
vast
learning
of
this
senator
his
speeches
sprinkled
with
the
likes
of
cicero
and
and
it
seems
fitting
to
close
with
one
of
his
passages
in
literature
passage
from
there
is
eagle
in
some
souls
that
can
alike
dive
down
into
the
blackest
gorges
and
soar
out
of
them
again
and
become
invisible
in
the
sunny
spaces
and
even
if
he
forever
flies
within
the
gorge
that
gorge
is
in
the
mountains
so
that
even
in
his
lowest
swoop
the
mountain
eagle
is
still
higher
than
any
other
bird
upon
the
plain
even
though
they
was
mountain
eagle
and
his
lowest
swoop
was
still
higher
than
the
other
birds
upon
the
plain
may
god
bless
may
he
be
welcomed
kindly
by
the
righteous
judge
and
may
his
spirit
soar
forever
like
eagle
high
above
the
heavens
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
everyone
please
have
seat
thank
you
very
much
let
let
me
thank
pastor
from
near
my
in
chicago
who
took
time
off
his
vacation
to
be
here
today
we
are
blessed
to
have
him
want
to
thank
president
and
our
hosts
here
at
american
university
acknowledge
my
outstanding
secretary
of
and
members
of
my
administration
all
the
members
of
congress
deserves
applause
to
all
the
members
of
congress
the
elected
officials
faith
and
law
enforcement
business
leaders
and
immigration
advocates
who
are
here
today
thank
you
for
your
presence
want
to
thank
american
university
for
welcoming
me
to
the
campus
once
again
some
may
recall
that
the
last
time
was
here
was
joined
by
dear
friend
and
giant
of
american
politics
senator
kennedy
not
here
right
now
but
his
legacy
of
civil
rights
and
health
care
and
worker
protections
is
still
with
us
was
candidate
for
president
that
day
and
some
may
recall
argued
that
our
country
had
reached
tipping
point
that
after
years
in
which
we
had
deferred
our
most
pressing
problems
and
too
often
yielded
to
the
politics
of
the
moment
we
now
faced
choice
we
could
squarely
confront
our
challenges
with
honesty
and
determination
or
we
could
consign
ourselves
and
our
children
to
future
less
prosperous
and
less
secure
believed
that
then
and
believe
it
now
and
why
even
as
tackled
the
most
severe
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
even
as
wound
down
the
war
in
iraq
and
refocused
our
efforts
in
my
administration
has
refused
to
ignore
some
of
the
fundamental
challenges
facing
this
generation
we
launched
the
most
aggressive
education
reforms
in
decades
so
that
our
children
can
gain
the
knowledge
and
skills
they
need
to
compete
in
century
global
economy
we
have
finally
delivered
on
the
promise
of
health
reform
reform
that
will
bring
greater
security
to
every
american
and
that
will
rein
in
the
costs
that
threaten
families
businesses
and
the
prosperity
of
our
nation
on
the
verge
of
reforming
an
outdated
and
ineffective
set
of
rules
governing
wall
street
to
give
greater
power
to
consumers
and
prevent
the
reckless
financial
speculation
that
led
to
this
severe
recession
and
accelerating
the
transition
to
clean
energy
economy
by
significantly
raising
the
standards
of
cars
and
trucks
and
by
doubling
our
use
of
renewable
energies
like
wind
and
solar
power
steps
that
have
the
potential
to
create
whole
new
industries
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
jobs
in
america
so
despite
the
forces
of
the
status
despite
the
and
the
frequent
pettiness
of
our
politics
we
are
confronting
the
great
challenges
of
our
times
and
while
this
work
easy
and
the
changes
we
seek
always
happen
overnight
what
made
clear
is
that
this
administration
will
not
just
kick
the
can
down
the
road
immigration
reform
is
no
exception
in
recent
days
the
issue
of
immigration
has
become
once
more
source
of
fresh
contention
in
our
country
with
the
passage
of
controversial
law
in
arizona
and
the
heated
reactions
seen
across
america
some
have
rallied
behind
this
new
policy
others
have
protested
and
launched
boycotts
of
the
state
and
everywhere
people
have
expressed
frustration
with
system
that
seems
fundamentally
broken
of
course
the
tensions
around
immigration
are
not
new
on
the
one
hand
always
defined
ourselves
as
nation
of
immigrants
nation
that
welcomes
those
willing
to
embrace
precepts
indeed
it
is
this
constant
flow
of
immigrants
that
helped
to
make
america
what
it
is
the
scientific
breakthroughs
of
einstein
the
inventions
of
the
great
ventures
of
andrew
steel
and
all
this
was
possible
because
of
immigrants
and
then
there
are
the
countless
names
and
the
quiet
acts
that
never
made
the
history
books
but
were
no
less
consequential
in
building
this
country
the
generations
who
braved
hardship
and
great
risk
to
reach
our
shores
in
search
of
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families
the
millions
of
people
ancestors
to
most
of
us
who
believed
that
there
was
place
where
they
could
be
at
long
last
free
to
work
and
worship
and
live
their
lives
in
peace
so
this
steady
stream
of
hardworking
and
talented
people
has
made
america
the
engine
of
the
global
economy
and
beacon
of
hope
around
the
world
and
allowed
us
to
adapt
and
thrive
in
the
face
of
technological
and
societal
change
to
this
day
america
reaps
incredible
economic
rewards
because
we
remain
magnet
for
the
best
and
brightest
from
across
the
globe
folks
travel
here
in
the
hopes
of
being
part
of
culture
of
entrepreneurship
and
ingenuity
and
by
doing
so
they
strengthen
and
enrich
that
culture
immigration
also
means
we
have
younger
workforce
and
economy
than
many
of
our
competitors
and
in
an
increasingly
interconnected
world
the
diversity
of
our
country
is
powerful
advantage
in
global
competition
just
few
weeks
ago
we
had
an
event
of
small
business
owners
at
the
white
house
and
one
business
owner
was
woman
named
who
came
to
this
country
became
citizen
and
opened
up
successful
technology
services
company
when
she
started
she
had
just
one
employee
today
she
employs
more
than
hundred
people
this
past
april
we
held
ceremony
at
the
white
house
for
members
of
our
armed
forces
even
though
they
were
not
yet
citizens
they
had
enlisted
one
of
them
was
woman
named
born
and
raised
in
mexico
came
to
the
united
states
shortly
after
and
she
eventually
joined
the
navy
and
she
said
take
pride
in
our
flag
and
the
history
that
forged
this
great
nation
and
the
history
we
write
day
by
these
women
and
men
and
women
across
this
country
like
them
remind
us
that
immigrants
have
always
helped
to
build
and
defend
this
country
and
that
being
an
american
is
not
matter
of
blood
or
birth
matter
of
faith
matter
of
fidelity
to
the
shared
values
that
we
all
hold
so
dear
what
makes
us
unique
what
makes
us
strong
anybody
can
help
us
write
the
next
great
chapter
in
our
history
now
we
forget
that
this
process
of
immigration
and
eventual
inclusion
has
often
been
painful
each
new
wave
of
immigrants
has
generated
fear
and
resentments
towards
newcomers
particularly
in
times
of
economic
upheaval
our
founding
was
rooted
in
the
notion
that
america
was
unique
as
place
of
refuge
and
freedom
for
in
thomas
words
but
the
ink
on
our
constitution
was
barely
dry
when
amidst
conflict
congress
passed
the
alien
and
sedition
acts
which
placed
harsh
restrictions
of
those
suspected
of
having
foreign
allegiances
century
ago
immigrants
from
ireland
italy
poland
other
european
countries
were
routinely
subjected
to
rank
discrimination
and
ugly
stereotypes
chinese
immigrants
were
held
in
detention
and
deported
from
angel
island
in
the
san
bay
they
even
get
to
come
in
so
the
politics
of
who
is
and
who
is
not
allowed
to
enter
this
country
and
on
what
terms
has
always
been
contentious
and
that
remains
true
today
and
made
worse
by
failure
of
those
of
us
in
washington
to
fix
broken
immigration
system
to
begin
with
our
borders
have
been
porous
for
decades
obviously
the
problem
is
greatest
along
our
southern
border
but
not
restricted
to
that
part
of
the
country
in
fact
because
we
do
very
good
job
of
tracking
who
comes
in
and
out
of
the
country
as
visitors
large
numbers
avoid
immigration
laws
simply
by
their
visas
the
result
is
an
estimated
million
undocumented
immigrants
in
the
united
states
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
men
and
women
are
simply
seeking
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
children
many
settle
in
sectors
of
the
economy
they
work
hard
they
save
they
stay
out
of
trouble
but
because
they
live
in
the
shadows
vulnerable
to
unscrupulous
businesses
who
pay
them
less
than
the
minimum
wage
or
violate
worker
safety
rules
thereby
putting
companies
who
follow
those
rules
and
americans
who
rightly
demand
the
minimum
wage
or
overtime
at
an
unfair
advantage
crimes
go
unreported
as
victims
and
witnesses
fear
coming
forward
and
this
makes
it
harder
for
the
police
to
catch
violent
criminals
and
keep
safe
and
billions
in
tax
revenue
are
lost
each
year
because
many
undocumented
workers
are
paid
under
the
table
more
fundamentally
the
presence
of
so
many
illegal
immigrants
makes
mockery
of
all
those
who
are
going
through
the
process
of
immigrating
legally
indeed
after
years
of
patchwork
fixes
and
revisions
the
legal
immigration
system
is
as
broken
as
the
borders
backlogs
and
bureaucracy
means
the
process
can
take
years
while
an
applicant
waits
for
approval
he
or
she
is
often
forbidden
from
visiting
the
united
states
which
means
even
husbands
and
wives
may
be
forced
to
spend
many
years
apart
high
fees
and
the
need
for
lawyers
may
exclude
worthy
applicants
and
while
we
provide
students
from
around
the
world
visas
to
get
engineering
and
computer
science
degrees
at
our
top
universities
our
laws
discourage
them
from
using
those
skills
to
start
business
or
power
new
industry
right
here
in
the
united
states
instead
of
training
entrepreneurs
to
create
jobs
on
our
shores
we
train
our
competition
in
sum
the
system
is
broken
and
everybody
knows
it
unfortunately
reform
has
been
held
hostage
to
political
posturing
and
wrangling
and
to
the
pervasive
sentiment
in
washington
that
tackling
such
thorny
and
emotional
issue
is
inherently
bad
politics
just
few
years
ago
when
was
senator
we
forged
bipartisan
coalition
in
of
comprehensive
reform
under
the
leadership
of
senator
kennedy
who
had
been
champion
of
immigration
reform
and
senator
john
we
worked
across
the
aisle
to
help
pass
bipartisan
bill
through
the
senate
but
that
effort
eventually
came
apart
and
now
under
the
pressures
of
partisanship
and
politics
many
of
the
republican
senators
who
voted
for
reform
in
the
past
have
now
backed
away
from
their
previous
support
into
this
breach
states
like
arizona
have
decided
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
given
the
levels
of
frustration
across
the
country
this
is
understandable
but
it
is
also
ill
conceived
and
not
just
that
the
law
arizona
passed
is
divisive
although
it
has
fanned
the
flames
of
an
already
contentious
debate
laws
like
put
huge
pressures
on
local
law
enforcement
to
enforce
rules
that
ultimately
are
unenforceable
it
puts
pressure
on
already
state
and
local
budgets
it
makes
it
difficult
for
people
here
illegally
to
report
crimes
driving
wedge
between
communities
and
law
enforcement
making
our
streets
more
dangerous
and
the
jobs
of
our
police
officers
more
difficult
and
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
this
you
can
speak
to
the
police
chiefs
and
others
from
law
enforcement
here
today
who
will
tell
you
the
same
thing
these
laws
also
have
the
potential
of
violating
the
rights
of
innocent
american
citizens
and
legal
residents
making
them
subject
to
possible
stops
or
questioning
because
of
what
they
look
like
or
how
they
sound
and
as
other
states
and
localities
go
their
own
ways
we
face
the
prospect
that
different
rules
for
immigration
will
apply
in
different
parts
of
the
country
patchwork
of
local
immigration
rules
where
we
all
know
one
clear
national
standard
is
needed
our
task
then
is
to
make
our
national
laws
actually
work
to
shape
system
that
reflects
our
values
as
nation
of
laws
and
nation
of
immigrants
and
that
means
being
honest
about
the
problem
and
getting
past
the
false
debates
that
divide
the
country
rather
than
bring
it
together
for
example
there
are
those
in
the
rights
community
who
have
argued
passionately
that
we
should
simply
provide
those
who
are
here
illegally
with
legal
status
or
at
least
ignore
the
laws
on
the
books
and
put
an
end
to
deportation
until
we
have
better
laws
and
often
this
argument
is
framed
in
moral
terms
why
should
we
punish
people
who
are
just
trying
to
earn
living
the
sense
of
compassion
that
drives
this
argument
but
believe
such
an
indiscriminate
approach
would
be
both
unwise
and
unfair
it
would
suggest
to
those
thinking
about
coming
here
illegally
that
there
will
be
no
repercussions
for
such
decision
and
this
could
lead
to
surge
in
more
illegal
immigration
and
it
would
also
ignore
the
millions
of
people
around
the
world
who
are
waiting
in
line
to
come
here
legally
ultimately
our
nation
like
all
nations
has
the
right
and
obligation
to
control
its
borders
and
set
laws
for
residency
and
citizenship
and
no
matter
how
decent
they
are
no
matter
their
reasons
the
million
who
broke
these
laws
should
be
held
accountable
now
if
the
majority
of
americans
are
of
blanket
amnesty
they
are
also
that
it
is
possible
to
round
up
and
deport
million
people
they
know
not
possible
such
an
effort
would
be
logistically
impossible
and
wildly
expensive
moreover
it
would
tear
at
the
very
fabric
of
this
nation
because
immigrants
who
are
here
illegally
are
now
intricately
woven
into
that
fabric
many
have
children
who
are
american
citizens
some
are
children
themselves
brought
here
by
their
parents
at
very
young
age
growing
up
as
american
kids
only
to
discover
their
illegal
status
when
they
apply
for
college
or
job
migrant
workers
mostly
here
illegally
have
been
the
force
of
our
farmers
and
agricultural
producers
for
generations
so
even
if
it
was
possible
program
of
mass
deportations
would
disrupt
our
economy
and
communities
in
ways
that
most
americans
would
find
intolerable
now
once
we
get
past
the
two
poles
of
this
debate
it
becomes
possible
to
shape
practical
approach
that
reflects
our
heritage
and
our
values
such
an
approach
demands
accountability
from
everybody
from
government
from
businesses
and
from
individuals
government
has
threshold
responsibility
to
secure
our
borders
why
directed
my
secretary
of
homeland
security
former
border
governor
to
improve
our
enforcement
policy
without
having
to
wait
for
new
law
today
we
have
more
boots
on
the
ground
near
the
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
let
me
repeat
that
we
have
more
boots
on
the
ground
on
the
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
we
doubled
the
personnel
assigned
to
border
enforcement
security
task
forces
we
tripled
the
number
of
intelligence
analysts
along
the
border
for
the
first
time
begun
screening
percent
of
southbound
rail
shipments
and
as
result
seizing
more
illegal
guns
cash
and
drugs
than
in
years
past
contrary
to
some
of
the
reports
that
you
see
crime
along
the
border
is
down
and
statistics
collected
by
customs
and
border
protection
reflect
significant
reduction
in
the
number
of
people
trying
to
cross
the
border
illegally
so
the
bottom
line
is
this
the
southern
border
is
more
secure
today
than
at
any
time
in
the
past
years
that
mean
we
have
more
work
to
do
we
have
to
do
that
work
but
important
that
we
acknowledge
the
facts
even
as
we
are
committed
to
doing
necessary
to
secure
our
borders
even
without
passage
of
the
new
law
there
are
those
who
argue
that
we
should
not
move
forward
with
any
other
elements
of
reform
until
we
have
fully
sealed
our
borders
but
our
borders
are
just
too
vast
for
us
to
be
able
to
solve
the
problem
only
with
fences
and
border
patrols
it
work
our
borders
will
not
be
secure
as
long
as
our
limited
resources
are
devoted
to
not
only
stopping
gangs
and
potential
terrorists
but
also
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
attempt
to
cross
each
year
simply
to
find
work
why
businesses
must
be
held
accountable
if
they
break
the
law
by
deliberately
hiring
and
exploiting
undocumented
workers
already
begun
to
step
up
enforcement
against
the
worst
workplace
offenders
and
implementing
and
improving
system
to
give
employers
reliable
way
to
verify
that
their
employees
are
here
legally
but
we
need
to
do
more
we
can
not
continue
just
to
look
the
other
way
as
significant
portion
of
our
economy
operates
outside
the
law
it
breeds
abuse
and
bad
practices
it
punishes
employers
who
act
responsibly
and
undercuts
american
workers
and
ultimately
if
the
demand
for
undocumented
workers
falls
the
incentive
for
people
to
come
here
illegally
will
decline
as
well
finally
we
have
to
demand
responsibility
from
people
living
here
illegally
they
must
be
required
to
admit
that
they
broke
the
law
they
should
be
required
to
register
pay
their
taxes
pay
fine
and
learn
english
they
must
get
right
with
the
law
before
they
can
get
in
line
and
earn
their
citizenship
not
just
because
it
is
fair
not
just
because
it
will
make
clear
to
those
who
might
wish
to
come
to
america
they
must
do
so
inside
the
bounds
of
the
law
but
because
this
is
how
we
demonstrate
that
being
what
being
an
american
means
being
citizen
of
this
country
comes
not
only
with
rights
but
also
with
certain
fundamental
responsibilities
we
can
create
pathway
for
legal
status
that
is
fair
reflective
of
our
values
and
works
now
stopping
illegal
immigration
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
reforming
our
creaky
system
of
legal
immigration
begun
to
do
that
by
eliminating
backlog
in
background
checks
that
at
one
point
stretched
back
almost
year
just
for
the
background
check
people
can
now
track
the
status
of
their
immigration
applications
by
email
or
text
message
improved
accountability
and
safety
in
the
detention
system
and
stemmed
the
increases
in
fees
but
here
too
we
need
to
do
more
we
should
make
it
easier
for
the
best
and
the
brightest
to
come
to
start
businesses
and
develop
products
and
create
jobs
our
laws
should
respect
families
following
the
rules
instead
of
splitting
them
apart
we
need
to
provide
farms
legal
way
to
hire
the
workers
they
rely
on
and
path
for
those
workers
to
earn
legal
status
and
we
should
stop
punishing
innocent
young
people
for
the
actions
of
their
parents
by
denying
them
the
chance
to
stay
here
and
earn
an
education
and
contribute
their
talents
to
build
the
country
where
grown
up
the
dream
act
would
do
this
and
why
supported
this
bill
as
state
legislator
and
as
senator
and
why
continue
to
support
it
as
president
so
these
are
the
essential
elements
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
the
question
now
is
whether
we
will
have
the
courage
and
the
political
will
to
pass
bill
through
congress
to
finally
get
it
done
last
summer
held
meeting
with
leaders
of
both
parties
including
many
of
the
republicans
who
had
supported
reform
in
the
past
and
some
who
was
pleased
to
see
bipartisan
framework
proposed
in
the
senate
by
senators
graham
and
chuck
with
whom
met
to
discuss
this
issue
spoken
with
the
congressional
hispanic
caucus
to
plot
the
way
forward
and
meet
and
then
met
with
them
earlier
this
week
and
spoken
with
representatives
from
growing
coalition
of
unions
and
business
groups
immigrant
advocates
and
community
law
enforcement
local
government
all
who
the
importance
of
immigration
reform
and
met
with
leaders
from
religious
communities
like
pastor
people
of
different
faiths
and
beliefs
some
liberal
some
conservative
who
nonetheless
share
sense
of
urgency
who
understand
that
fixing
our
broken
immigration
system
is
not
only
political
issue
not
just
an
economic
issue
but
moral
imperative
as
well
so
made
progress
ready
to
move
forward
the
majority
of
democrats
are
ready
to
move
forward
and
believe
the
majority
of
americans
are
ready
to
move
forward
but
the
fact
is
without
bipartisan
support
as
we
had
just
few
years
ago
we
can
not
solve
this
problem
reform
that
brings
accountability
to
our
immigration
system
can
not
pass
without
republican
votes
that
is
the
political
and
mathematical
reality
the
only
way
to
reduce
the
risk
that
this
effort
will
again
falter
because
of
politics
is
if
members
of
both
parties
are
willing
to
take
responsibility
for
solving
this
problem
once
and
for
all
and
yes
this
is
an
emotional
question
and
one
that
lends
itself
to
demagoguery
time
and
again
this
issue
has
been
used
to
divide
and
inflame
and
to
people
and
so
the
understandable
the
natural
impulse
among
those
who
run
for
office
is
to
turn
away
and
defer
this
question
for
another
day
or
another
year
or
another
administration
despite
the
courageous
leadership
in
the
past
shown
by
many
democrats
and
some
republicans
including
by
the
way
my
predecessor
president
bush
this
has
been
the
custom
that
is
why
broken
and
dangerous
system
that
offends
our
most
basic
american
values
is
still
in
place
but
believe
we
can
put
politics
aside
and
finally
have
an
immigration
system
accountable
believe
we
can
appeal
not
to
fears
but
to
their
hopes
to
their
highest
ideals
because
who
we
are
as
americans
been
inscribed
on
our
seal
since
we
declared
our
independence
out
of
many
one
that
is
what
has
drawn
the
persecuted
and
impoverished
to
our
shores
what
led
the
innovators
and
from
around
the
world
to
take
chance
here
in
the
land
of
opportunity
what
has
led
people
to
endure
untold
hardships
to
reach
this
place
called
america
one
of
the
largest
waves
of
immigration
in
our
history
took
place
little
more
than
century
ago
at
the
time
jewish
people
were
being
driven
out
of
eastern
europe
often
escaping
to
the
sounds
of
gunfire
and
the
light
from
their
villages
burning
to
the
ground
the
journey
could
take
months
as
families
crossed
rivers
in
the
dead
of
night
miles
by
foot
endured
rough
and
dangerous
passage
over
the
north
atlantic
once
here
many
made
their
homes
in
teeming
and
bustling
lower
it
was
at
this
time
that
young
woman
named
lazarus
whose
own
family
fled
persecution
from
europe
generations
earlier
took
up
the
cause
of
these
new
immigrants
although
she
was
poet
she
spent
much
of
her
time
advocating
for
better
health
care
and
housing
for
the
newcomers
and
inspired
by
what
she
saw
and
heard
she
wrote
down
her
thoughts
and
donated
piece
of
work
to
help
pay
for
the
construction
of
new
statue
the
statue
of
liberty
which
actually
was
funded
in
part
by
small
donations
from
people
across
america
years
before
the
statue
was
built
years
before
it
would
be
seen
by
throngs
of
immigrants
craning
their
necks
skyward
at
the
end
of
long
and
brutal
voyage
years
before
it
would
come
to
everything
that
we
cherish
she
imagined
what
it
could
mean
she
imagined
the
sight
of
giant
statue
at
the
entry
point
of
great
nation
but
unlike
the
great
monuments
of
the
past
this
would
not
signal
an
empire
instead
it
would
signal
arrival
to
place
of
opportunity
and
refuge
and
freedom
at
our
sunset
gates
shall
stand
she
wrote
mighty
woman
with
from
her
glows
ancient
lands
your
pomp
me
your
tired
and
your
poor
your
huddled
masses
yearning
to
be
send
these
the
homeless
to
me
lift
my
lamp
beside
the
golden
door
let
us
remember
these
words
for
it
falls
on
each
generation
to
ensure
that
that
lamp
that
beacon
continues
to
shine
as
source
of
hope
around
the
world
and
source
of
our
prosperity
here
at
home
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
good
afternoon
today
accepted
general
resignation
as
commander
of
the
international
security
assistance
force
in
did
so
with
considerable
regret
but
also
with
certainty
that
it
is
the
right
thing
for
our
mission
in
for
our
military
and
for
our
country
also
pleased
to
nominate
general
david
to
take
command
in
which
will
allows
us
to
maintain
the
momentum
and
leadership
that
we
need
to
succeed
do
make
this
decision
based
on
any
difference
in
policy
with
general
as
we
are
in
full
agreement
about
our
strategy
nor
do
make
this
decision
out
of
any
sense
of
personal
insult
has
always
shown
great
courtesy
and
carried
out
my
orders
faithfully
got
great
admiration
for
him
and
for
his
long
record
of
service
in
uniform
over
the
last
nine
years
with
america
fighting
wars
in
iraq
and
he
has
earned
reputation
as
one
of
our
nation
finest
soldiers
that
reputation
is
founded
upon
his
extraordinary
dedication
his
deep
intelligence
and
his
love
of
country
relied
on
his
service
particularly
in
helping
to
design
and
lead
our
new
strategy
in
so
all
americans
should
be
grateful
for
general
remarkable
career
in
uniform
but
war
is
bigger
than
any
one
man
or
woman
whether
private
general
or
president
and
as
difficult
as
it
is
to
lose
general
believe
that
it
is
the
right
decision
for
our
national
security
the
conduct
represented
in
the
recently
published
article
does
not
meet
the
standard
that
should
be
set
by
commanding
general
it
undermines
the
civilian
control
of
the
military
that
is
at
the
core
of
our
democratic
system
and
it
erodes
the
trust
that
necessary
for
our
team
to
work
together
to
achieve
our
objectives
in
my
multiple
responsibilities
as
led
me
to
this
decision
first
have
responsibility
to
the
extraordinary
men
and
women
who
are
fighting
this
war
and
to
the
democratic
institutions
that
been
elected
to
lead
got
no
greater
than
serving
as
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
it
is
my
duty
to
ensure
that
no
diversion
complicates
the
vital
mission
that
they
are
carrying
out
that
includes
adherence
to
strict
code
of
conduct
the
strength
and
greatness
of
our
military
is
rooted
in
the
fact
that
this
code
applies
equally
to
newly
enlisted
privates
and
to
the
general
officer
who
commands
them
that
allows
us
to
come
together
as
one
that
part
of
the
reason
why
america
has
the
finest
fighting
force
in
the
history
of
the
world
it
is
also
true
that
our
democracy
depends
upon
institutions
that
are
stronger
than
individuals
that
includes
strict
adherence
to
the
military
chain
of
command
and
respect
for
civilian
control
over
that
chain
of
command
and
that
why
as
believe
this
decision
is
necessary
to
hold
ourselves
accountable
to
standards
that
are
at
the
core
of
our
democracy
second
have
responsibility
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
succeed
in
and
in
our
broader
effort
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
believe
that
this
mission
demands
unity
of
effort
across
our
alliance
and
across
my
national
security
team
and
do
think
that
we
can
sustain
that
unity
of
effort
and
achieve
our
objectives
in
without
making
this
change
that
too
has
guided
my
decision
just
told
my
national
security
team
that
now
is
the
time
for
all
of
us
to
come
together
doing
so
is
not
an
option
but
an
obligation
welcome
debate
among
my
team
but
tolerate
division
all
of
us
have
personal
interests
all
of
us
have
opinions
our
politics
often
fuels
conflict
but
we
have
to
renew
our
sense
of
common
purpose
and
meet
our
responsibilities
to
one
another
and
to
our
troops
who
are
in
harm
way
and
to
our
country
we
need
to
remember
what
this
is
all
about
our
nation
is
at
war
we
face
very
tough
fight
in
but
americans
do
flinch
in
the
face
of
difficult
truths
or
difficult
tasks
we
persist
and
we
persevere
we
will
not
tolerate
safe
haven
for
terrorists
who
want
to
destroy
afghan
society
from
within
and
launch
attacks
against
innocent
men
women
and
children
in
our
country
and
around
the
world
so
make
no
mistake
we
have
clear
goal
we
are
going
to
break
the
momentum
we
are
going
to
build
afghan
capacity
we
are
going
to
relentlessly
apply
pressure
on
and
its
leadership
strengthening
the
ability
of
both
and
pakistan
to
do
the
same
that
the
strategy
that
we
agreed
to
last
fall
that
is
the
policy
that
we
are
carrying
out
in
and
pakistan
in
that
effort
we
are
to
be
joined
by
allies
and
partners
who
have
stood
by
us
and
paid
the
ultimate
price
through
the
loss
of
their
young
people
at
war
they
are
with
us
because
the
interests
and
values
that
we
share
and
because
this
mission
is
fundamental
to
the
ability
of
free
people
to
live
in
peace
and
security
in
the
century
and
general
and
were
able
to
spend
some
time
this
morning
discussing
the
way
forward
extraordinarily
grateful
that
he
has
agreed
to
serve
in
this
new
capacity
it
should
be
clear
to
everybody
he
does
so
at
great
personal
sacrifice
to
himself
and
to
his
family
and
he
is
setting
an
extraordinary
example
of
service
and
patriotism
by
assuming
this
difficult
post
let
me
say
to
the
american
people
this
is
change
in
personnel
but
it
is
not
change
in
policy
general
fully
participated
in
our
review
last
fall
and
he
both
supported
and
helped
design
the
strategy
that
we
have
in
place
in
his
current
post
at
central
command
he
was
worked
closely
with
our
forces
in
he
has
worked
closely
with
congress
he
has
worked
closely
with
the
afghan
and
pakistan
governments
and
with
all
our
partners
in
the
region
he
has
my
full
confidence
and
am
urging
the
senate
to
confirm
him
for
this
new
assignment
as
swiftly
as
possible
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
it
was
difficult
decision
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
made
today
indeed
it
saddens
me
to
lose
the
service
of
soldier
who
come
to
respect
and
admire
but
the
reasons
that
led
me
to
this
decision
are
the
same
principles
that
have
supported
the
strength
of
our
military
and
our
nation
since
the
founding
so
once
again
thank
general
for
his
enormous
contributions
to
the
security
of
this
nation
and
to
the
success
of
our
mission
in
look
forward
to
working
with
general
and
my
entire
national
security
team
to
succeed
in
our
mission
and
reaffirm
that
america
stands
as
one
in
our
support
for
the
men
and
women
who
defend
it

and
his
grandchildren
where
is
he
there
he
is
right
there
could
use
little
trim
one
year
ago
this
week
we
kicked
off
national
conversation
on
fatherhood
and
personal
responsibility
and
members
of
our
administration
fanned
out
all
across
the
country
to
hear
from
fathers
and
families
about
the
challenges
that
they
face
secretary
our
secretary
of
education
held
discussion
in
new
about
the
link
between
fatherhood
and
educational
achievement
talked
to
fathers
in
california
about
balancing
the
needs
of
their
families
with
the
demands
of
their
jobs
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
held
town
hall
for
military
and
veteran
dads
in
north
and
attorney
general
holder
to
georgia
for
forum
about
fathers
in
our
criminal
justice
system
and
in
each
of
these
places
each
of
these
leaders
posed
simple
question
how
can
we
as
nation
not
just
the
government
but
businesses
and
community
groups
and
concerned
citizens
how
can
we
all
come
together
to
help
fathers
meet
their
responsibilities
to
our
families
and
communities
and
we
did
this
because
we
know
the
vital
role
fathers
play
in
the
lives
of
our
children
fathers
are
our
first
teachers
and
coaches
or
in
my
house
assistant
teachers
and
assistant
coaches
laughter
to
mom
but
our
mentors
our
role
models
they
show
us
by
the
example
they
set
the
kind
of
people
they
want
us
to
become
but
we
also
know
that
what
too
many
fathers
being
absent
means
too
many
fathers
missing
from
too
many
homes
missing
from
too
many
lives
we
know
that
when
fathers
abandon
their
responsibilities
harm
done
to
those
kids
we
know
that
children
who
grow
up
without
father
are
more
likely
to
live
in
poverty
they
more
likely
to
drop
out
of
school
they
more
likely
to
wind
up
in
prison
more
likely
to
abuse
drugs
and
alcohol
more
likely
to
run
away
from
home
more
likely
to
become
teenage
parents
themselves
and
say
all
this
as
someone
who
grew
up
without
father
in
my
own
life
he
left
my
family
when
was
two
years
old
and
while
was
lucky
to
have
wonderful
mother
and
loving
grandparents
who
poured
everything
they
had
into
me
and
my
sister
still
felt
the
weight
of
that
absence
something
that
leaves
hole
in
life
that
no
government
can
fill
so
we
can
talk
all
we
want
here
in
washington
about
issues
like
education
and
health
care
and
crime
we
can
build
good
schools
we
can
put
money
into
creating
good
jobs
we
can
do
everything
we
can
to
keep
our
streets
safe
but
government
keep
our
kids
from
looking
for
trouble
on
those
streets
government
force
kid
to
pick
up
book
or
make
sure
that
the
homework
gets
done
government
be
there
day
in
day
out
to
provide
discipline
and
guidance
and
the
love
that
it
takes
to
raise
child
our
job
as
fathers
as
mothers
as
guardians
for
our
children
the
fact
is
easy
to
become
father
technically
any
guy
can
do
that
hard
to
live
up
to
the
lifelong
responsibilities
that
come
with
fatherhood
and
challenge
even
in
good
times
when
our
families
are
doing
well
especially
difficult
when
times
are
tough
families
are
straining
just
to
keep
everything
together
in
time
of
war
many
of
our
military
families
are
stretched
thin
with
fathers
doing
multiple
tours
of
duty
far
away
from
their
children
in
difficult
economic
times
lot
of
fathers
are
worried
about
whether
going
to
be
able
to
keep
their
job
or
find
job
or
whether
be
able
to
pay
the
bills
and
give
their
children
the
kinds
of
opportunities
that
if
they
have
them
themselves
at
least
they
wished
for
their
children
and
there
are
lot
of
men
who
are
out
of
work
and
wrestling
with
the
shame
and
frustration
that
comes
when
you
feel
like
you
be
the
kind
of
provider
you
want
to
be
for
the
people
that
you
love
but
the
key
message
think
all
of
us
want
to
send
today
to
fathers
all
across
the
country
our
children
need
us
to
be
they
need
us
to
be
perfect
they
do
need
us
to
be
present
they
need
us
to
show
up
and
give
it
our
best
shot
no
matter
what
else
is
going
on
in
our
lives
they
need
us
to
show
them
not
just
with
words
but
with
deeds
that
they
those
kids
are
always
our
first
priority
those
family
meals
afternoons
in
the
park
bedtime
stories
the
encouragement
we
give
the
questions
we
answer
the
limits
we
set
the
example
we
set
of
persistence
in
the
face
of
difficulty
and
hardship
those
things
add
up
over
time
and
they
shape
character
build
their
core
teach
them
to
trust
in
life
and
to
enter
into
it
with
confidence
and
with
hope
and
with
determination
and
something
always
carry
with
them
that
love
that
we
show
not
with
money
or
fame
or
spectacular
feats
but
through
small
daily
acts
the
love
we
show
and
that
we
earn
by
being
present
in
the
lives
of
our
children
now
unfortunately
the
way
we
talk
about
fatherhood
in
this
country
always
reinforce
these
truths
when
we
talk
about
issues
like
child
care
and
balance
we
call
them
and
too
often
when
we
talk
about
fatherhood
and
personal
responsibility
we
talk
about
it
in
political
terms
in
terms
of
left
and
right
instead
of
right
and
wrong
and
when
we
do
that
gotten
off
track
so
think
time
for
new
conversation
around
fatherhood
in
this
country
we
can
all
agree
that
got
too
many
mothers
out
there
forced
to
do
everything
all
by
themselves
doing
heroic
job
often
under
trying
circumstances
they
deserve
lot
of
credit
for
that
but
they
have
to
do
it
alone
the
work
of
raising
our
children
is
the
most
important
job
in
this
country
and
all
of
our
responsibilities
mothers
and
fathers
now
legislate
fatherhood
force
anybody
to
love
child
but
what
we
can
do
is
send
clear
message
to
our
fathers
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
failing
to
meet
their
obligations
what
we
can
do
is
make
it
easier
for
fathers
who
make
responsible
choices
and
harder
for
those
who
avoid
those
choices
what
we
can
do
is
come
together
and
support
fathers
who
are
willing
to
step
up
and
be
good
partners
and
parents
and
providers
and
why
today
launching
the
next
phase
of
our
work
to
promote
responsible
fatherhood
new
nationwide
fatherhood
and
initiative
this
is
call
to
action
with
cities
and
states
with
individuals
and
across
the
country
from
the
players
association
to
the
national
to
everyday
moms
and
dads
raising
awareness
about
responsible
fatherhood
and
working
to
absent
fathers
with
their
families
as
part
of
this
effort
proposed
new
and
expanded
fatherhood
marriage
and
families
innovation
fund
and
we
plan
to
seek
out
and
support
the
very
best
most
successful
initiatives
in
our
states
and
communities
those
that
are
offering
services
like
job
training
or
parenting
skills
classes
domestic
violence
prevention
all
which
help
provide
the
kind
of
network
of
support
for
men
particularly
those
in
vulnerable
communities
also
going
to
help
dads
who
get
caught
up
we
want
to
make
sure
that
they
caught
up
on
child
support
payments
and
that
we
them
in
their
lives
going
to
support
efforts
to
build
healthy
relationships
between
parents
as
well
because
we
know
that
children
benefit
not
just
from
loving
mothers
and
loving
fathers
but
from
strong
and
loving
marriages
as
well
also
launching
new
transitional
jobs
initiative
for
and
fathers
because
these
are
men
who
often
face
serious
barriers
to
finding
work
and
keeping
work
help
them
develop
the
skills
and
experience
they
need
to
move
into
employment
so
they
can
meet
their
child
support
obligations
and
help
provide
for
their
families
and
under
direction
our
justice
department
is
planning
to
create
its
first
for
dads
and
to
help
replicate
this
program
in
courts
across
the
country
the
idea
here
is
very
simple
to
reach
fathers
right
as
leaving
the
criminal
justice
system
and
connect
them
immediately
to
the
employment
and
services
they
need
to
start
making
their
child
support
payments
and
reconnecting
them
with
their
families
this
program
was
inspired
by
leaders
like
peter
spokes
who
was
the
executive
director
of
the
national
for
fathering
good
friend
to
many
in
our
administration
all
of
whom
were
deeply
saddened
by
his
recent
passing
and
we
are
to
have
wife
with
us
here
today
just
saw
her
earlier
there
she
is
thank
you
so
these
initiatives
are
good
start
but
ultimately
we
know
that
the
decision
to
be
good
father
up
to
us
each
of
us
as
individuals
one
that
men
across
this
country
are
making
every
single
day
attending
those
school
assemblies
conferences
coaching
soccer
little
league
and
saving
and
working
that
extra
shift
so
that
their
children
can
go
to
college
and
plenty
of
fathers
and
men
who
fathers
as
well
are
stepping
up
to
serve
as
mentors
and
tutors
and
big
brothers
and
foster
parents
to
young
people
who
have
any
responsible
adult
in
their
lives
even
when
we
give
it
our
best
efforts
there
will
still
be
plenty
of
days
of
struggle
and
heartache
when
we
quite
measure
up
talking
to
the
men
here
now
even
with
all
the
good
fortune
and
support
and
have
had
in
our
lives
made
plenty
of
mistakes
as
parent
lost
count
of
all
the
times
when
the
demands
of
work
have
taken
me
from
the
duties
of
fatherhood
and
know
missed
out
on
moments
in
my
lives
that
never
get
back
and
loss
hard
to
accept
but
also
know
the
feeling
that
one
author
described
when
she
wrote
that
have
to
decide
forever
to
have
your
heart
go
walking
around
outside
your
think
about
that
to
have
child
is
to
have
your
heart
walking
around
outside
your
body
sure
lot
of
fathers
here
know
that
same
memory
that
have
of
driving
home
with
and
right
after
she
was
born
going
about
miles
an
hour
your
emotions
swinging
between
unadulterated
joy
and
sheer
terror
and
made
pledge
that
day
that
would
do
everything
could
to
give
my
daughter
what
never
had
that
if
could
be
anything
in
life
would
be
good
father
and
like
lot
of
the
men
here
since
that
time
found
nothing
else
in
my
life
that
compares
to
the
pleasures
take
in
spending
time
with
my
girls
nothing
else
comes
close
to
the
pride
feel
in
their
achievement
and
the
satisfaction
get
in
watching
them
grow
into
strong
confident
young
women
over
the
course
of
my
life
have
been
an
attorney
been
professor
been
state
senator
been
senator
and
currently
am
serving
as
president
of
the
united
states
but
can
say
without
hesitation
that
the
most
challenging
most
fulfilling
most
important
job
will
have
during
my
time
on
this
earth
is
to
be
and
dad
so
you
need
fancy
degree
for
that
you
need
lot
of
money
for
that
no
matter
what
doubts
we
may
feel
what
difficulties
we
may
face
we
all
have
to
remember
being
father
not
just
an
obligation
and
responsibility
it
is
privilege
and
blessing
one
that
we
all
have
to
embrace
as
individuals
and
as
nation
so
happy
day
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
hello
everybody
all
right
everybody
have
seat
got
lot
to
say
here
first
of
all
want
to
just
thank
for
the
extraordinary
work
that
she
has
done
on
behalf
of
nurses
on
behalf
of
patients
on
behalf
of
the
country
thank
you
so
much
we
are
proud
of
everything
that
done
and
her
mom
is
in
the
house
so
thanks
mom
good
job
good
job
with
want
to
thank
the
of
the
american
nurses
association
and
also
want
to
acknowledge
the
presence
here
of
mary
who
is
our
for
those
of
you
who
are
not
familiar
she
is
the
administrator
of
and
our
nurse
in
the
administration
and
does
absolutely
great
work
now
want
to
tell
you
it
is
an
to
speak
to
the
ana
representing
more
than
million
registered
nurses
across
the
country
part
of
the
reason
here
is
because
promised
was
going
to
come
and
told
to
that
break
promises
to
nurses
because
you
never
know
when
going
to
need
shot
and
want
them
working
that
needle
all
kind
of
find
so
keeping
my
promises
but
not
just
out
of
fear
also
because
love
nurses
love
nurses
now
not
just
saying
that
because
talking
to
roomful
of
nurses
there
are
representatives
from
illinois
here
in
the
house
and
they
will
testify
loved
nurses
before
got
to
washington
and
think
alone
in
that
because
virtually
all
of
us
at
one
time
or
another
in
our
lives
have
known
the
care
and
the
skill
that
you
offer
in
hours
of
need
in
moments
where
people
are
most
vulnerable
most
worried
nurses
are
there
doing
difficult
and
lifesaving
work
and
you
just
provide
clean
bandages
or
an
intravenous
line
nurse
will
hold
your
hand
sometime
or
offer
voice
of
calm
or
that
knowing
glance
that
says
things
are
going
to
be
okay
and
when
was
born
remember
vividly
the
nurses
who
took
care
of
and
our
new
baby
the
doctor
who
delivered
is
actually
one
of
our
best
friends
but
she
was
there
about
minutes
and
the
nurse
was
there
the
whole
time
tending
to
this
new
family
of
ours
that
was
happy
day
now
there
was
another
day
when
our
youngest
daughter
she
was
three
months
old
was
diagnosed
with
meningitis
and
it
was
nurses
who
walked
us
through
what
was
happening
and
who
along
with
the
doctors
helped
make
sure
that
was
all
right
and
that
her
father
did
not
have
breakdown
so
as
father
as
husband
will
forever
be
in
debt
to
the
women
and
men
of
your
profession
and
know
that
millions
of
others
feel
the
same
way
nurses
are
the
beating
heart
of
our
medical
system
on
the
front
lines
you
are
on
the
front
lines
of
health
care
in
small
clinics
and
in
large
hospitals
in
rural
towns
and
in
big
cities
all
across
america
and
because
you
know
our
health
care
system
so
well
that
been
such
fierce
advocate
for
its
reform
because
after
all
you
care
for
patients
who
end
up
in
the
emergency
room
or
in
surgery
because
they
afford
the
preventive
care
that
would
have
made
more
invasive
and
costly
treatment
unnecessary
you
are
asked
not
only
to
take
care
of
patients
got
to
navigate
tangle
of
rules
and
forms
and
paperwork
that
drive
up
costs
and
prevent
you
from
doing
the
best
job
possible
the
ones
who
see
the
terror
in
eyes
when
an
insurance
company
bureaucrat
has
denied
coverage
for
treatment
and
the
ones
who
have
to
comfort
people
who
are
wracked
with
worry
not
only
about
getting
better
but
also
about
paying
for
health
care
because
hit
cap
on
benefits
or
their
insurance
cover
condition
so
nurses
have
seen
the
consequences
of
our
failure
to
reform
our
health
care
system
the
rising
costs
the
increased
uninsured
the
mixed
up
incentives
the
overburdened
providers
and
complex
system
that
has
been
working
lot
better
for
insurance
companies
than
working
for
the
american
people
or
for
providers
and
that
why
almost
year
ago
nurses
from
across
the
country
came
to
the
white
house
to
help
make
the
case
for
reform
for
making
coverage
more
affordable
and
extending
coverage
to
millions
without
it
for
giving
doctors
and
nurses
more
freedom
to
help
their
patients
for
providing
families
and
small
businesses
with
more
control
over
their
health
insurance
and
for
ending
the
worst
and
most
abusive
practices
of
the
insurance
industry
and
after
long
and
tough
fight
we
succeeded
yes
we
did
in
passing
health
care
reform
thanks
to
you
and
that
reform
will
make
positive
difference
in
the
lives
of
the
american
people
now
this
fight
new
for
the
ana
understand
you
were
one
of
the
only
major
health
care
that
supported
the
creation
of
from
the
start
and
want
to
one
of
your
leaders
of
who
is
here
today
and
was
your
president
back
then
for
the
courage
and
leadership
she
showed
where
is
she
there
you
are
right
there
give
her
big
round
of
applause
so
been
there
before
and
you
were
here
this
time
and
want
to
thank
the
ana
for
advocating
for
health
care
reform
for
ensuring
that
the
voices
of
nurses
and
of
patients
were
heard
now
already
seeing
the
start
of
profound
shift
as
reforms
begin
to
take
effect
giving
ordinary
consumers
and
small
businesses
more
power
and
protection
in
the
health
care
system
and
knocking
down
barriers
that
stand
between
you
and
the
people
who
you
care
for
few
weeks
ago
million
small
business
owners
and
got
postcard
in
their
mailbox
from
the
now
usually
that
not
good
news
but
this
time
it
was
because
it
told
them
that
they
could
be
eligible
for
health
care
tax
cut
this
year
tax
cut
worth
potentially
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
those
small
businesses
tax
cut
that
will
help
millions
to
provide
coverage
to
their
employees
that
happening
now
in
many
cases
young
adults
without
health
insurance
are
now
able
to
stay
on
their
plan
until
years
old
even
though
insurance
companies
had
until
september
to
comply
with
this
rule
we
asked
them
to
do
so
immediately
to
avoid
coverage
gaps
for
young
adults
and
most
have
agreed
starting
this
month
relief
is
also
available
to
businesses
for
providing
coverage
to
who
are
not
yet
eligible
for
and
as
of
last
week
senior
citizens
who
fall
into
the
doughnut
hole
have
started
receiving
rebate
to
help
them
afford
their
medication
and
going
to
keep
on
going
until
we
close
that
doughnut
hole
completely
in
the
meantime
strengthening
by
going
after
the
billions
of
dollars
in
waste
and
fraud
and
abuse
in
the
system
and
states
like
maine
and
are
beginning
to
predict
budget
savings
as
pieces
of
reform
come
so
begun
making
coverage
more
affordable
in
addition
the
new
health
care
law
has
also
started
to
end
the
worst
insurance
industry
practices
you
know
them
for
too
long
been
held
hostage
to
an
industry
that
jacks
up
premiums
and
drops
coverage
whenever
they
please
those
days
are
coming
to
an
end
so
after
my
administration
demanded
that
large
insurance
company
justify
massive
premium
increase
on
the
company
backed
off
its
plan
my
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
has
urged
states
to
investigate
other
rate
hikes
set
up
new
office
of
consumer
information
and
insurance
oversight
and
provide
grants
to
states
running
the
best
oversight
programs
to
root
out
bad
practices
when
it
comes
to
premiums
now
as
of
september
the
new
health
care
law
prohibits
insurance
companies
from
dropping
coverage
when
they
get
sick
which
is
critical
to
giving
people
some
peace
of
mind
but
when
news
reports
indicated
that
an
insurance
company
was
dropping
the
coverage
of
women
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
my
administration
called
on
them
to
end
the
practice
immediately
wait
till
september
and
soon
after
the
entire
industry
announced
that
it
would
comply
with
the
new
law
early
and
stop
this
perverse
practice
of
dropping
insurance
when
they
fall
ill
and
when
they
need
coverage
the
most
some
were
also
questioning
whether
insurance
companies
could
find
loophole
in
the
new
law
and
continue
to
discriminate
against
children
with
conditions
so
we
called
on
insurance
companies
to
step
up
provide
coverage
to
our
most
vulnerable
americans
and
the
insurance
industry
has
agreed
in
just
two
weeks
americans
denied
coverage
because
of
conditions
will
be
able
to
enroll
in
new
national
insurance
pool
and
for
states
that
opt
to
run
their
own
pools
using
funds
from
the
new
law
urging
them
to
begin
enrolling
people
as
soon
as
possible
and
these
pools
are
going
to
provide
some
relief
but
they
temporary
going
to
ensure
that
folks
who
have
been
shut
out
of
the
market
because
been
sick
can
access
more
affordable
insurance
starting
right
away
but
what
we
want
is
these
health
insurance
exchanges
up
and
running
in
few
years
so
that
at
that
point
this
kind
of
discrimination
will
finally
be
banned
forever
and
when
those
that
when
the
millions
without
coverage
including
people
with
conditions
will
have
the
access
to
the
same
types
of
insurance
plans
that
members
of
congress
get
and
you
know
those
must
be
pretty
good
also
going
to
be
putting
in
place
bill
of
rights
that
will
tell
insurance
companies
that
they
put
restrictive
limit
on
the
amount
of
coverage
you
get
in
your
lifetime
or
in
given
year
it
will
prevent
insurance
companies
from
rescinding
your
coverage
when
you
get
sick
because
of
an
administrative
error
it
will
provide
simple
and
clear
information
to
consumers
about
their
choices
and
their
rights
and
beyond
making
insurance
more
affordable
and
more
secure
reform
also
will
mean
changes
that
make
it
easier
for
you
the
backbone
of
the
health
care
system
to
do
your
jobs
already
over
the
past
year
made
one
of
the
largest
investments
in
the
nursing
and
health
workforce
in
recent
history
we
passed
landmark
reforms
to
make
college
more
affordable
which
can
help
more
people
gain
nursing
degree
even
as
we
provide
grants
and
aid
for
more
than
nurses
seeking
graduate
degrees
and
other
training
and
begun
the
transition
to
private
and
secure
health
records
because
this
will
not
only
reduce
errors
and
costs
know
you
read
those
handwriting
it
will
mean
you
can
spend
more
time
with
patients
and
less
time
with
paperwork
and
that
why
you
got
into
the
profession
now
there
is
more
work
to
do
and
that
why
today
my
administration
is
announcing
number
of
investments
to
expand
the
primary
care
workforce
this
includes
funding
to
allow
students
training
to
become
nurse
practitioners
to
start
training
we
want
to
speed
up
the
process
where
folks
go
from
the
classroom
into
the
exam
room
and
going
to
provide
resources
for
clinics
run
by
registered
nurses
and
nurse
practitioners
without
these
nurses
many
people
in
cities
and
rural
areas
would
have
no
access
to
care
at
all
now
all
of
these
steps
are
part
of
larger
effort
to
make
our
system
work
better
for
nurses
and
for
doctors
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
care
for
patients
and
by
focusing
on
primary
medicine
we
will
finally
the
role
of
all
talented
and
skilled
health
care
providers
including
nurses
have
to
tell
you
that
nurses
all
too
often
have
been
given
short
shrift
even
amidst
nursing
shortage
when
there
are
cutbacks
you
feel
the
squeeze
in
salaries
or
the
reduction
in
shifts
despite
being
overworked
and
underpaid
and
as
you
know
this
disregard
goes
beyond
numbers
on
ledger
there
have
been
bunch
of
times
sure
when
the
service
you
rendered
is
thought
to
be
less
consequential
or
valuable
than
that
of
other
professions
that
what
has
to
change
important
that
we
not
only
ensure
that
you
have
the
support
to
do
your
jobs
seeking
to
elevate
and
value
the
work
that
you
do
because
throughout
our
history
nurses
have
done
more
than
provide
care
and
comfort
to
those
in
need
often
with
little
power
or
sway
on
their
own
nurses
mostly
women
historically
have
been
force
of
will
and
sense
of
common
decency
and
paved
the
way
towards
better
care
and
more
compassionate
society
from
treatment
of
wounded
soldiers
at
to
the
advocacy
of
on
behalf
of
people
with
mental
disabilities
to
the
countless
nurses
whose
names
never
know
one
of
greatest
poets
also
served
as
nurse
during
the
civil
war
and
the
experience
changed
him
forever
later
he
would
reflect
on
that
time
on
both
the
heartbreak
and
the
he
found
during
those
years
and
he
wrote
thread
my
way
through
the
hospitals
the
hurt
and
wounded
pacify
with
soothing
hand
sit
by
the
restless
all
the
dark
night
some
are
so
young
some
suffer
so
much
recall
the
experience
sweet
and
sad
sweet
and
sad
your
jobs
are
tough
your
days
can
be
stressful
and
exhausting
and
sometimes
thankless
but
through
long
shifts
and
late
nights
in
the
hectic
scrum
of
the
emergency
room
or
in
those
quiet
acts
of
humanity
you
are
saving
lives
you
are
offering
solace
helping
to
make
us
better
nation
and
my
task
as
president
our
task
as
people
is
to
ensure
that
our
health
care
system
is
worthy
of
your
efforts
our
mission
must
be
to
live
up
to
the
values
you
uphold
each
and
every
day
so
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
everybody
thank
you
good
evening
as
we
speak
our
nation
faces
multitude
of
challenges
at
home
our
top
priority
is
to
recover
and
rebuild
from
recession
that
has
touched
the
lives
of
nearly
every
american
abroad
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
taking
the
fight
to
wherever
it
exists
and
tonight
returned
from
trip
to
the
gulf
coast
to
speak
with
you
about
the
battle
waging
against
an
oil
spill
that
is
assaulting
our
shores
and
our
citizens
on
april
an
explosion
ripped
through
horizon
drilling
rig
about
miles
off
the
coast
of
eleven
workers
lost
their
lives
seventeen
others
were
injured
and
soon
nearly
mile
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ocean
oil
began
spewing
into
the
water
because
there
has
never
been
leak
this
size
at
this
depth
stopping
it
has
tested
the
limits
of
human
technology
why
just
after
the
rig
sank
assembled
team
of
our
best
scientists
and
engineers
to
tackle
this
challenge
team
led
by
physicist
and
our
secretary
of
energy
scientists
at
our
national
labs
and
experts
from
academia
and
other
oil
companies
have
also
provided
ideas
and
advice
as
result
of
these
efforts
directed
to
additional
equipment
and
technology
and
in
the
coming
weeks
and
days
these
efforts
should
capture
up
to
percent
of
the
oil
leaking
out
of
the
well
this
is
until
the
company
finishes
drilling
relief
well
later
in
the
summer
expected
to
stop
the
leak
completely
already
this
oil
spill
is
the
worst
environmental
disaster
america
has
ever
faced
and
unlike
an
earthquake
or
hurricane
not
single
event
that
does
its
damage
in
matter
of
minutes
or
days
the
millions
of
gallons
of
oil
that
have
spilled
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
are
more
like
an
epidemic
one
that
we
will
be
fighting
for
months
and
even
years
but
make
no
mistake
we
will
fight
this
spill
with
everything
got
for
as
long
as
it
takes
we
will
make
pay
for
the
damage
their
company
has
caused
and
we
will
do
necessary
to
help
the
gulf
coast
and
its
people
recover
from
this
tragedy
tonight
like
to
lay
out
for
you
what
our
battle
plan
is
going
forward
what
doing
to
clean
up
the
oil
what
doing
to
help
our
in
the
gulf
and
what
doing
to
make
sure
that
catastrophe
like
this
never
happens
again
first
the
cleanup
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
crisis
the
federal
government
has
been
in
charge
of
the
largest
environmental
cleanup
effort
in
our
history
an
effort
led
by
admiral
who
has
almost
years
of
experience
responding
to
disasters
we
now
have
nearly
personnel
who
are
working
across
four
states
to
contain
and
clean
up
the
oil
thousands
of
ships
and
other
vessels
are
responding
in
the
gulf
and
the
deployment
of
over
national
guard
members
along
the
coast
these
servicemen
and
women
are
ready
to
help
stop
the
oil
from
coming
ashore
ready
to
help
clean
the
beaches
train
response
workers
or
even
help
with
processing
claims
and
urge
the
governors
in
the
affected
states
to
activate
these
troops
as
soon
as
possible
because
of
our
efforts
millions
of
gallons
of
oil
have
already
been
removed
from
the
water
through
burning
skimming
and
other
collection
methods
over
five
and
half
million
feet
of
boom
has
been
laid
across
the
water
to
block
and
absorb
the
approaching
oil
approved
the
construction
of
new
barrier
islands
in
to
try
to
stop
the
oil
before
it
reaches
the
shore
and
working
with
alabama
and
florida
to
implement
creative
approaches
to
their
unique
coastlines
as
the
cleanup
continues
we
will
offer
whatever
additional
resources
and
assistance
our
coastal
states
may
need
now
of
this
speed
and
magnitude
will
never
be
perfect
and
new
challenges
will
always
arise
saw
and
heard
evidence
of
that
during
this
trip
so
if
something
working
we
want
to
hear
about
it
if
there
are
problems
in
the
operation
we
will
fix
them
but
we
have
to
that
despite
our
best
efforts
oil
has
already
caused
damage
to
our
coastline
and
its
wildlife
and
sadly
no
matter
how
effective
our
response
is
there
will
be
more
oil
and
more
damage
before
this
siege
is
done
why
the
second
thing
focused
on
is
the
recovery
and
restoration
of
the
gulf
coast
you
know
for
generations
men
and
women
who
call
this
region
home
have
made
their
living
from
the
water
that
living
is
now
in
jeopardy
talked
to
and
fishermen
who
know
how
going
to
support
their
families
this
year
seen
empty
docks
and
restaurants
with
fewer
customers
even
in
areas
where
the
beaches
are
not
yet
affected
talked
to
owners
of
shops
and
hotels
who
wonder
when
the
tourists
might
start
coming
back
the
sadness
and
the
anger
they
feel
is
not
just
about
the
money
lost
about
wrenching
anxiety
that
their
way
of
life
may
be
lost
refuse
to
let
that
happen
tomorrow
will
meet
with
the
chairman
of
and
inform
him
that
he
is
to
set
aside
whatever
resources
are
required
to
compensate
the
workers
and
business
owners
who
have
been
harmed
as
result
of
his
recklessness
and
this
fund
will
not
be
controlled
by
in
order
to
ensure
that
all
legitimate
claims
are
paid
out
in
fair
and
timely
manner
the
account
must
and
will
be
administered
by
an
independent
third
party
beyond
compensating
the
people
of
the
gulf
in
the
short
term
also
clear
we
need
plan
to
restore
the
unique
beauty
and
bounty
of
this
region
the
oil
spill
represents
just
the
latest
blow
to
place
already
suffered
multiple
economic
disasters
and
decades
of
environmental
degradation
that
has
led
to
disappearing
wetlands
and
habitats
and
the
region
still
recovered
from
hurricanes
and
why
we
must
make
commitment
to
the
gulf
coast
that
goes
beyond
responding
to
the
crisis
of
the
moment
make
that
commitment
tonight
earlier
asked
ray
the
secretary
of
the
navy
who
is
also
former
governor
of
and
son
of
the
gulf
coast
to
develop
gulf
coast
restoration
plan
as
soon
as
possible
the
plan
will
be
designed
by
states
local
communities
tribes
fishermen
businesses
conservationists
and
other
gulf
residents
and
will
pay
for
the
impact
this
spill
has
had
on
the
region
the
third
part
of
our
response
plan
is
the
steps
taking
to
ensure
that
disaster
like
this
does
not
happen
again
few
months
ago
approved
proposal
to
consider
new
limited
offshore
drilling
under
the
assurance
that
it
would
be
absolutely
safe
that
the
proper
technology
would
be
in
place
and
the
necessary
precautions
would
be
taken
that
obviously
was
not
the
case
in
the
horizon
rig
and
want
to
know
why
the
american
people
deserve
to
know
why
the
families
met
with
last
week
who
lost
their
loved
ones
in
the
explosion
these
families
deserve
to
know
why
and
so
established
national
commission
to
understand
the
causes
of
this
disaster
and
offer
recommendations
on
what
additional
safety
and
environmental
standards
we
need
to
put
in
place
already
issued
moratorium
on
drilling
know
this
creates
difficulty
for
the
people
who
work
on
these
rigs
but
for
the
sake
of
their
safety
and
for
the
sake
of
the
entire
region
we
need
to
know
the
facts
before
we
allow
drilling
to
continue
and
while
urge
the
commission
to
complete
its
work
as
quickly
as
possible
expect
them
to
do
that
work
thoroughly
and
impartially
one
place
already
begun
to
take
action
is
at
the
agency
in
charge
of
regulating
drilling
and
issuing
permits
known
as
the
minerals
management
service
over
the
last
decade
this
agency
has
become
emblematic
of
failed
philosophy
that
views
all
regulation
with
hostility
philosophy
that
says
corporations
should
be
allowed
to
play
by
their
own
rules
and
police
themselves
at
this
agency
industry
insiders
were
put
in
charge
of
industry
oversight
oil
companies
showered
regulators
with
gifts
and
and
were
essentially
allowed
to
conduct
their
own
safety
inspections
and
write
their
own
regulations
when
ken
became
my
secretary
of
the
interior
one
of
his
very
first
acts
was
to
clean
up
the
worst
of
the
corruption
at
this
agency
but
now
clear
that
the
problem
there
ran
much
deeper
and
the
pace
of
reform
was
just
too
slow
and
so
secretary
and
are
bringing
in
new
leadership
at
the
agency
who
was
tough
federal
prosecutor
and
inspector
general
and
his
charge
over
the
next
few
months
is
to
build
an
that
acts
as
the
oil
watchdog
not
its
partner
so
one
of
the
lessons
learned
from
this
spill
is
that
we
need
better
regulations
better
safety
standards
and
better
enforcement
when
it
comes
to
offshore
drilling
but
larger
lesson
is
that
no
matter
how
much
we
improve
our
regulation
of
the
industry
drilling
for
oil
these
days
entails
greater
risk
after
all
oil
is
finite
resource
we
consume
more
than
percent
of
the
oil
but
have
less
than
percent
of
the
oil
reserves
and
part
of
the
reason
oil
companies
are
drilling
mile
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ocean
because
running
out
of
places
to
drill
on
land
and
in
shallow
water
for
decades
we
have
known
the
days
of
cheap
and
easily
accessible
oil
were
numbered
for
decades
talked
and
talked
about
the
need
to
end
addiction
to
fossil
fuels
and
for
decades
we
have
failed
to
act
with
the
sense
of
urgency
that
this
challenge
requires
time
and
again
the
path
forward
has
been
blocked
not
only
by
oil
industry
lobbyists
but
also
by
lack
of
political
courage
and
the
consequences
of
our
inaction
are
now
in
plain
sight
countries
like
china
are
investing
in
clean
energy
jobs
and
industries
that
should
be
right
here
in
america
each
day
we
send
nearly
billion
of
our
wealth
to
foreign
countries
for
their
oil
and
today
as
we
look
to
the
gulf
we
see
an
entire
way
of
life
being
threatened
by
menacing
cloud
of
black
crude
we
can
not
consign
our
children
to
this
future
the
tragedy
unfolding
on
our
coast
is
the
most
painful
and
powerful
reminder
yet
that
the
time
to
embrace
clean
energy
future
is
now
now
is
the
moment
for
this
generation
to
embark
on
national
mission
to
unleash
innovation
and
seize
control
of
our
own
destiny
this
is
not
some
distant
vision
for
america
the
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
is
going
to
take
some
time
but
over
the
last
year
and
half
already
taken
unprecedented
action
to
jumpstart
the
clean
energy
industry
as
we
speak
old
factories
are
reopening
to
produce
wind
turbines
people
are
going
back
to
work
installing
windows
and
small
businesses
are
making
solar
panels
consumers
are
buying
more
efficient
cars
and
trucks
and
families
are
making
their
homes
more
scientists
and
researchers
are
discovering
clean
energy
technologies
that
someday
will
lead
to
entire
new
industries
each
of
us
has
part
to
play
in
new
future
that
will
benefit
all
of
us
as
we
recover
from
this
recession
the
transition
to
clean
energy
has
the
potential
to
grow
our
economy
and
create
millions
of
jobs
but
only
if
we
accelerate
that
transition
only
if
we
seize
the
moment
and
only
if
we
rally
together
and
act
as
one
nation
workers
and
entrepreneurs
scientists
and
citizens
the
public
and
private
sectors
when
was
candidate
for
this
office
laid
out
set
of
principles
that
would
move
our
country
towards
energy
independence
last
year
the
house
of
representatives
acted
on
these
principles
by
passing
strong
and
comprehensive
energy
and
climate
bill
bill
that
finally
makes
clean
energy
the
profitable
kind
of
energy
for
businesses
now
there
are
costs
associated
with
this
transition
and
there
are
some
who
believe
that
we
afford
those
costs
right
now
say
we
afford
not
to
change
how
we
produce
and
use
energy
because
the
costs
to
our
economy
our
national
security
and
our
environment
are
far
greater
so
happy
to
look
at
other
ideas
and
approaches
from
either
party
as
long
they
seriously
tackle
our
addiction
to
fossil
fuels
some
have
suggested
raising
efficiency
standards
in
our
buildings
like
we
did
in
our
cars
and
trucks
some
believe
we
should
set
standards
to
ensure
that
more
of
our
electricity
comes
from
wind
and
solar
power
others
wonder
why
the
energy
industry
only
spends
fraction
of
what
the
industry
does
on
research
and
development
and
want
to
rapidly
boost
our
investments
in
such
research
and
development
all
of
these
approaches
have
merit
and
deserve
fair
hearing
in
the
months
ahead
but
the
one
approach
will
not
accept
is
inaction
the
one
answer
will
not
settle
for
is
the
idea
that
this
challenge
is
somehow
too
big
and
too
difficult
to
meet
you
know
the
same
thing
was
said
about
our
ability
to
produce
enough
planes
and
tanks
in
world
war
the
same
thing
was
said
about
our
ability
to
harness
the
science
and
technology
to
land
man
safely
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
yet
time
and
again
we
have
refused
to
settle
for
the
paltry
limits
of
conventional
wisdom
instead
what
has
defined
us
as
nation
since
our
founding
is
the
capacity
to
shape
our
destiny
our
determination
to
fight
for
the
america
we
want
for
our
children
even
if
unsure
exactly
what
that
looks
like
even
if
we
yet
know
precisely
how
going
to
get
there
we
know
get
there
faith
in
the
future
that
sustains
us
as
people
it
is
that
same
faith
that
sustains
our
in
the
gulf
right
now
each
year
at
the
beginning
of
season
the
fishermen
take
part
in
tradition
that
was
brought
to
america
long
ago
by
fishing
immigrants
from
europe
called
blessing
of
the
fleet
and
today
celebration
where
clergy
from
different
religions
gather
to
say
prayer
for
the
safety
and
success
of
the
men
and
women
who
will
soon
head
out
to
sea
some
for
weeks
at
time
the
ceremony
goes
on
in
good
times
and
in
bad
it
took
place
after
and
it
took
place
few
weeks
ago
at
the
beginning
of
the
most
difficult
season
these
fishermen
have
ever
faced
and
still
they
came
and
they
prayed
for
as
priest
and
former
fisherman
once
said
of
the
tradition
blessing
is
not
that
god
has
promised
to
remove
all
obstacles
and
dangers
the
blessing
is
that
he
is
with
us
always
blessing
granted
in
the
midst
of
the
the
oil
spill
is
not
the
last
crisis
america
will
face
this
nation
has
known
hard
times
before
and
we
will
surely
know
them
again
what
sees
us
through
what
has
always
seen
us
through
is
our
strength
our
resilience
and
our
unyielding
faith
that
something
better
awaits
us
if
we
summon
the
courage
to
reach
for
it
tonight
we
pray
for
that
courage
we
pray
for
the
people
of
the
gulf
and
we
pray
that
hand
may
guide
us
through
the
storm
towards
brighter
day

you

bless
you

god
bless

but
this
is
my
fourth
visit
to
the
gulf
coast
since
the
start
of
this
spill
yesterday
was
over
in
alabama
and
now
assessing
the
situation
reviewing
the
response
seeing
what
needs
to
be
done
better
and
faster
and
talking
with
folks
whether
fishermen
or
small
business
people
and
their
families
who
are
seeing
their
lives
turned
by
this
disaster
here
in
the
beautiful
beaches
are
still
open
the
sand
is
white
and
the
water
is
blue
so
folks
who
are
looking
for
good
vacation
they
can
still
come
down
to
people
need
to
know
that
is
still
open
for
business
but
that
mean
that
people
angry
that
mean
that
people
scared
that
mean
that
people
have
concerns
about
the
future
we
all
have
those
concerns
and
people
have
every
right
to
be
angry
those
plumes
of
oil
are
off
the
coast
the
fishing
waters
are
closed
tar
balls
have
been
coming
ashore
and
everybody
is
bracing
for
more
so
say
today
what
been
saying
up
and
down
the
coast
over
the
last
couple
of
days
and
over
the
last
month
yes
this
is
an
unprecedented
environmental
disaster
the
worst
in
our
history
but
going
to
continue
to
meet
it
with
an
unprecedented
federal
response
and
recovery
effort
the
largest
in
our
history
this
is
an
assault
on
our
shores
and
going
to
fight
back
with
everything
got
and
that
includes
the
resources
of
the
greatest
military
in
the
world
here
at
naval
air
station
been
one
of
the
major
staging
areas
helped
to
support
the
response
effort
and
thank
you
for
that
and
know
the
people
of
thank
you
for
that
and
all
along
the
gulf
coast
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
active
guard
and
reserve
from
across
the
country
are
stepping
up
and
helping
out
soldiers
on
the
beaches
putting
out
sandbags
and
building
barriers
and
cleaning
up
the
oil
and
helping
people
process
their
claims
for
compensation
from
sailors
and
marines
offering
their
ships
and
their
and
their
helicopters
and
miles
of
boom
airmen
overhead
flying
in
equipment
and
spraying
dispersant
and
of
course
there
are
coast
guardsmen
and
women
on
the
cutters
in
the
air
working
around
the
clock
and
when
say
this
is
the
largest
response
of
its
kind
in
american
history
mean
it
got
more
than
vessels
on
site
tugs
barges
dozens
of
aircraft
more
than
personnel
are
on
the
scene
fighting
this
every
day
putting
out
millions
of
feet
of
boom
and
cleaning
the
shores
all
told
the
deployment
of
national
guardsmen
to
respond
to
this
crisis
so
far
only
about
have
been
activated
that
leaves
lot
of
guardsmen
ready
to
help
and
if
our
governors
call
on
them
know
be
ready
because
always
ready
so
want
the
people
of
this
region
to
know
that
my
administration
is
going
to
do
whatever
it
takes
for
as
long
as
it
takes
to
deal
with
this
disaster
that
includes
the
additional
actions
announced
yesterday
to
make
sure
that
seafood
from
the
gulf
is
safe
to
eat
it
includes
steps
taken
to
protect
the
safety
of
workers
involved
in
the
cleanup
it
includes
the
new
command
structure
announced
this
morning
to
make
sure
states
and
local
communities
like
have
the
autonomy
and
the
resources
that
they
need
to
go
forward
and
that
includes
something
else
making
sure
pays
for
the
damages
that
it
has
caused
applause
because
this
just
an
environmental
disaster
for
many
families
and
communities
an
economic
disaster
here
in
and
the
tourism
is
everything
and
when
the
tourists
stay
home
it
ripples
out
and
hits
folks
across
these
communities
the
charter
boats
the
hotels
the
restaurants
the
roadside
stores
the
shops
the
suppliers
the
dive
shops
and
if
your
inland
waters
are
contaminated
if
the
bays
and
are
contaminated
it
could
be
devastating
changing
the
way
of
life
down
here
for
years
to
come
going
to
speak
to
the
nation
tonight
about
this

are
getting
the
help

need
to
protect
this
beautiful
coast

rehabilitate
the
damaged

this
region

again

the
right
strategy
in
iraq
where
partnering
with
the
iraqi
people
for
their
security
and
prosperity
and
thanks
to
the
and
the
heroism
of
our
troops
we
are
poised
to
end
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
this
summer
on
schedule
as
we
end
the
war
in
iraq
pressing
forward
in
working
to
break
the
momentum
of
the
insurgency
and
train
afghan

forces
strengthen
the
capacity
of
the
afghan
government
and
protect
the
afghan
people
we
will
disrupt
and
dismantle
and
ultimately
defeat
and
its
terrorist
affiliates
applause
and
we
will
support
the
aspirations
of
people
around
the
world
as
they
seek
progress
and
opportunity
and
prosperity
because
what
we
do
as
americans
as
you
meet
the
missions
we
ask
of
you
going
to
make
sure
trained
and
equipped
to
succeed
why
we
halted
reductions
in
the
navy
why
we
increased
the
size
of
the
marine
corps
why
investing
in
the
capabilities
and
technologies
of
tomorrow
and
as
we
come
up
on
the
anniversary
of
naval
aviation
next
year
committed
to
the
next
generation
of
aircraft
going
to
keep
you
the
military
that
the
world
has
ever
known
some
of
that
is
about
technology
but
the
most
important
thing
in
our
military
is
our
people
all
of
you
and
as
you
advance
through
the
ranks
and
start
families
of
your
own
we
want
to
be
there
for
your
loved
ones
too
this
is
one
of
the
defining
missions
of
the
first
lady
on
sunday
she
visited
the
corps
team
and
their
families
at
camp
and
they
had
tough
week
because
five
outstanding
marines
from
gave
their
lives
last
week
in
during
her
visit
had
message
for
their
families
and
for
all
military
families
america
is
going
to
keep
faith
with
you
too
when
loved
one
goes
to
war
that
family
goes
to
war
why
working
to
improve
family
readiness
and
increase
pay
and
benefits
working
to
give
you
more
time
between
deployments
increasing
support
to
help
spouses
and
families
deal
with
the
stresses
and
the
separation
of
war
but
this
be
the
work
of
government
alone
as
has
been
saying
percent
of
americans
may
be
fighting
our
wars
but
percent
of
americans
need
to
be
supporting
our
men
and
women
and
their
families
in
uniform
you
guys
be
carrying
the
entire
burden
why
is
challenging
every
sector
of
american
society
to
support
our
military
families
not
just
now
with
our
nation
at
war
but
at
every
stage
of
your
lives
so
improving
care
for
our
wounded
warriors
especially
those
with
stress
and
traumatic
brain
injury
funding
the
bill
to
give
you
and
your
families
the
chance
to
pursue
your
dreams
made
historic
commitment
to
our
veterans
with
one
of
the
largest
percentage
increases
to
the
budget
in
the
past
years
those
are
concrete
actions
taken
to
meet
the
commitment
have
to
you
and
that
the
american
people
have
to
you
because
always
taken
care
of
america
america
needs
to
take
care
of
you
and
my
main
message
here
today
all
in
this
together
in
our
country
there
and
all
americans
not
democrats
and
republicans
when
you
take
the
long
view
all
americans
we
all
rise
and
fall
together
and
we
all
need
to
do
our
part
to
get
through
the
challenges
we
face
as
people
so
yes
emerging
from
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
too
many
folks
are
still
out
of
work
here
in
florida
and
around
the
country
yes
nation
at
war
with
adversaries
who
will
stop
at
nothing
to
strike
our
homeland
and
would
kill
innocent
people
women
and
children
with
no
compunction
yes
now
battling
the
worst
economic
environmental
disaster
in
american
history
any
one
of
these
challenges
alone
would
test
our
country
confronting
them
all
at
once
might
overwhelm
lesser
nation
but
look
around
you
look
at
the
person
standing
next
to
you
you
look
around
and
you
see
the
strength
and
resilience
that
will
carry
us
through
you
look
at
this
installation
and
the
forts
that
have
stood
watch
over
this
bay
and
its
people
for
centuries
through
the
rise
and
fall
of
empires
through
terrible
civil
war
and
as
nation
healed
itself
we
became
beacon
to
the
world
endured
all
of
these
men
and
women
in
uniform
all
of
you
represent
the
same
spirit
of
service
and
sacrifice
as
those
gone
before
who
defeated
fascism
defeated
tyranny
prevailed
in
long
cold
war
over
communism
and
now
in
our
time
toppled
regimes
based
on
terror
and
dictatorship
and
given
new
hope
to
millions
of
people
earned
your
place
among
the
greatest
of
generations
and
look
at
the
people
of
this
city
and
this
region
fishermen
made
their
lives
on
the
water
families
lived
here
for
generations
hardworking
folks
had
to
endure
more
than
their
share
tough
economic
times
and
hurricanes
and
storms
that
forced
so
many
families
and
communities
to
start
over
from
scratch
but
they
never
gave
up
they
started
over
and
they
rebuilt
stronger
than
before
as
americans
we
quit
we
keep
coming
none
of
these
challenges
facing
are
going
to
be
easy
none
of
them
are
going
to
be
quick
but
make
no
mistake
the
united
states
of
america
has
gone
through
tough
times
before
and
we
always
come
out
stronger
and
we
will
do
so
again
and
this
city
and
this
region
will
recover
it
will
thrive
again
and
military
will
prevail
in
the
mission
to
keep
our
country
safe
and
our
nation
will
endure
from
these
trials
stronger
than
before
that
is
the
history
of
the
united
states
of
america
that
is
the
legacy
of
our
armed
forces
and
promise
you
that
we
will
not
falter
past
generations
have
passed
on
this
precious
gift
to
us
and
future
generations
are
depending
on
us
and
as
look
out
on
each
and
every
one
of
your
faces
absolutely
confident
that
you
will
meet
that
challenge
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
alright
good
afternoon
everybody
today
the
united
nations
security
council
voted
overwhelmingly
to
sanction
iran
for
its
continued
failure
to
live
up
to
its
obligations
this
resolution
will
put
in
place
the
toughest
sanctions
ever
faced
by
the
iranian
government
and
it
sends
an
unmistakable
message
about
the
international
commitment
to
stopping
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
for
years
the
iranian
government
has
failed
to
live
up
to
its
obligations
under
the
nuclear
treaty
it
has
violated
its
commitments
to
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
it
has
ignored
security
council
resolutions
and
while
leaders
hide
behind
outlandish
rhetoric
their
actions
have
been
deeply
troubling
indeed
when
took
office
just
over
months
ago
iranian
intransigence
was
iran
had
gone
from
zero
centrifuges
spinning
to
several
thousand
and
the
international
community
was
divided
about
how
to
move
forward
yet
this
day
was
not
inevitable
we
made
clear
from
the
beginning
of
my
administration
that
the
united
states
was
prepared
to
pursue
diplomatic
solutions
to
address
the
concerns
over
iranian
nuclear
programs
extended
the
offer
of
engagement
on
the
basis
of
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
together
with
the
united
kingdom
with
russia
china
and
germany
we
sat
down
with
our
iranian
counterparts
we
offered
the
opportunity
of
better
relationship
between
iran
and
the
international
community
one
that
reduced
political
isolation
and
increased
its
economic
integration
with
the
rest
of
the
world
in
short
we
offered
the
iranian
government
the
prospect
of
better
future
for
its
people
if
and
only
if
it
lives
up
to
its
international
obligations
so
there
is
no
double
standard
at
play
here
made
it
clear
time
and
again
that
we
respect
right
like
all
countries
to
access
peaceful
nuclear
energy
that
is
right
embedded
in
the
treaty
that
has
to
serve
as
the
safeguard
against
world
in
which
more
nations
acquire
the
most
deadly
weapons
and
international
law
is
treated
as
an
empty
promise
that
treaty
was
signed
by
all
the
parties
involved
and
it
is
treaty
that
the
united
states
has
sought
to
strengthen
from
the
day
took
office
including
through
our
own
commitments
to
reduce
nuclear
arsenal
so
let
me
repeat
we
rights
but
with
those
rights
come
responsibilities
and
time
and
again
the
iranian
government
has
failed
to
meet
those
responsibilities
iran
concealed
nuclear
enrichment
facility
in
that
raised
serious
questions
about
the
nature
of
its
program
iran
further
violated
its
own
obligations
under
security
council
resolutions
to
suspend
uranium
enrichment
instead
enriching
up
to
percent
it
has
failed
to
comply
fully
with
requirements
indeed
iran
is
the
only
signatory
in
the
world
the
only
one
that
can
not
convince
the
that
its
nuclear
program
is
intended
for
peaceful
purposes
why
the
international
community
was
compelled
to
impose
these
serious
consequences
these
are
the
most
comprehensive
sanctions
that
the
iranian
government
has
faced
they
will
impose
restrictions
on
nuclear
activities
its
ballistic
missile
program
and
for
the
first
time
its
conventional
military
they
will
put
new
framework
in
place
to
stop
iranian
smuggling
and
crack
down
on
iranian
banks
and
financial
transactions
they
target
individuals
entities
and
institutions
including
those
associated
with
the
revolutionary
guard
that
have
supported
nuclear
program
and
prospered
from
illicit
activities
at
the
expense
of
the
iranian
people
and
we
will
ensure
that
these
sanctions
are
vigorously
enforced
just
as
we
continue
to
refine
and
enforce
our
own
sanctions
on
iran
alongside
our
friends
and
our
allies
the
strong
resolution
that
was
passed
today
benefited
from
strong
international
support
in
voting
for
it
we
were
joined
by
nations
from
asia
africa
europe
and
latin
america
including
russia
and
china
and
these
sanctions
show
the
united
view
of
the
international
community
that
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
middle
east
is
in
interest
and
that
nations
must
be
held
accountable
for
challenging
the
global
regime
the
iranian
government
must
understand
that
true
security
will
not
come
through
the
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
true
security
will
come
through
adherence
to
international
law
and
the
demonstration
of
its
peaceful
intent
we
know
that
the
iranian
government
will
not
change
its
overnight
but
vote
demonstrates
the
growing
costs
that
will
come
with
iranian
intransigence
and
want
to
be
clear
these
sanctions
do
not
close
the
door
on
diplomacy
iran
continues
to
have
the
opportunity
to
take
different
and
better
path
would
like
nothing
more
than
to
reach
the
day
when
the
iranian
government
its
international
obligations
day
when
these
sanctions
are
lifted
previous
sanctions
are
lifted
and
the
iranian
people
can
finally
the
greatness
of
the
iranian
nation
indeed
these
sanctions
are
not
directed
at
the
iranian
people
as
said
in
cairo
for
decades
the
iranian
government
has
defined
itself
in
opposition
to
my
country
but
faced
with
the
opportunity
to
find
new
way
forward
one
that
would
benefit
its
own
people
the
iranian
government
has
chosen
instead
to
remain
prisoner
of
the
past
saturday
will
mark
one
year
from
the
day
that
an
election
captivated
the
attention
of
the
world
an
event
that
should
have
been
remembered
for
how
the
iranian
people
participated
with
remarkable
enthusiasm
but
will
instead
be
remembered
for
how
the
iranian
government
brutally
suppressed
dissent
and
murdered
the
innocent
including
young
woman
left
to
die
in
the
street
actions
do
have
consequences
and
today
the
iranian
government
will
face
some
of
those
consequences
because
whether
it
is
threatening
the
nuclear
regime
or
the
human
rights
of
its
own
citizens
or
the
stability
of
its
own
by
supporting
terrorism
the
iranian
government
continues
to
demonstrate
that
its
own
unjust
actions
are
threat
to
justice
everywhere
want
and
hope
for
the
people
of
iran
that
the
government
of
iran
will
make
different
choice
it
can
make
different
choice
and
pursue
course
that
will
reaffirm
the
as
the
basis
of
global
and
disarmament
course
that
will
advance
own
security
and
prosperity
and
the
peace
of
the
wider
world
sanctions
are
yet
another
signal
that
if
the
iranian
government
continues
to
undermine
the
and
the
peace
that
it
protects
then
iran
will

article
from

just

had
been
chosen
as
one
of
the
six
finalists
in
our

to
the
top

this
is
contest
to
highlight
schools
that
promote
academic
excellence
personal
responsibility
and
that
best
prepare
students
for
college
and
careers
and
this
article
in
the
gazette
quoted
young
lady
named

is
is
here
she
right
over
there
anyway
audience
members

over
there
hey

was
quoted
as
saying
the
kind
of
school
that

what
we
do
and
our
school
is
this
is
what
said
school

members
of
the
community

after
three
rounds
of
competition
with
more
than
thousand
schools
and
more
than
votes
cast
know
and
america
knows
what
done
at
central
you
are
amazing

our
amazing
secretary
of
education

as
community
embraced
the
motto
of
this
school
district
child
every
opportunity
every
every
time
every
child
every
opportunity
every
time
because
you
believe
like
do
that
every
young
person
every
child
regardless
of
what
they
look
like
where
they
come
from
how
much
money
their
parents
have
every
child
who
walks
through
your
schoolhouse
doors
deserves
quality
education
no
exceptions
and
here
tonight
because
think
that
america
has
lot
to
learn
from
central
about
what
makes
for
successful
school
in
this
new
century
got
educators
raising
standards
and
then
inspiring
their
students
to
meet
them
got
community
members
who
are
stepping
up
as
tutors
and
mentors
and
coaches
you
got
parents
who
are
taking
an
active
interest
in
their
education
attending
those
teacher
conferences
yes
turning
off
the
once
in
while
making
sure
homework
gets
done
is
here
tonight
because
these
are
the
values
these
are
the
changes
that
encouraging
in
every
school
in
this
nation
the
key
to
our
future
but
the
most
important
ingredient
is
you
students
who
raised
your
sights
who
aimed
high
who
invested
yourselves
in
your
own
success
no
accident
that
so
many
of
you
have
received
college
admissions
letters
class
of
that
happen
by
accident
it
happened
because
you
worked
for
it
as
the
superintendent
said
you
earned
it
so
agree
with
you
what
done
here
at
central
is
amazing
am
proud
of
you
your
parents
are
proud
of
you
your
teachers
your
principal
all
incredibly
proud
now
graduates
all
these
folks
around
you
have
to
say
though
with
the
cameras
and
the
beaming
smiles
worked
hard
to
give
you
everything
you
need
to
pursue
your
dreams
and
your
talent
unfortunately
you
take
them
with
you
when
you
leave
here
no
one
is
going
to
go
follow
you
around
making
sure
that
getting
to
class
on
time
making
sure
doing
your
work
nobody
is
going
to
be
doing
that
for
you
going
forward
all
on
you
responsibility
for
your
success
is
squarely
on
your
shoulders
and
the
question
have
for
you
today
is
this
what
is
each
what
are
each
of
you
going
to
do
to
meet
that
responsibility
now
right
now
getting
plenty
of
advice
from
everybody
some
of
helpful
and
so
hate
to
pile
on
with
advice
but
while
here
what
the
heck
figure
should
offer
few
thoughts
based
on
my
own
experiences
but
also
based
on
my
hopes
for
all
of
you
and
for
our
country
in
the
years
ahead
first
understand
that
your
success
in
life
be
determined
just
by
given
to
you
or
what
happens
to
you
but
by
what
you
do
with
all
given
to
you
what
you
do
with
all
that
happens
to
you
how
hard
you
try
how
far
you
push
yourself
how
high
willing
to
reach
true
excellence
only
comes
with
perseverance
this
something
really
understood
when
was
back
your
age
my
father
some
of
you
know
left
my
family
when
was
two
years
old
was
raised
by
single
mom
and
my
grandparents
and
sometimes
had
tendency
to
goof
off
as
my
mother
put
it
had
tendency
sometimes
to
act
bit
casual
about
my
future
sometimes
was
rebellious
sometimes
little
too
much
oh
yes
yes
this
is
cautionary
tale
be
cheering
when
say
that
studied
just
enough
to
get
by
thought
hard
work
responsibility
just
people
want
to
tell
me
what
to
do
but
after
few
years
after
was
living
solely
on
my
own
and
that
living
solely
for
my
own
entertainment
so
entertaining
anymore
that
it
particularly
satisfying
anymore
that
seem
to
be
making
much
of
ripple
in
the
world
started
to
change
my
tune
that
by
refusing
to
apply
myself
there
was
nothing
could
point
to
that
was
proud
of
that
would
last
now
you
come
of
an
age
in
popular
culture
that
actually
reinforces
this
approach
to
life
you
watch
and
basically
what
it
says
is
you
can
be
rich
and
successful
without
much
effort
you
just
have
to
become
celebrity
if
you
can
achieve
some
reality
notoriety
better
than
lasting
achievement
we
live
in
culture
that
tells
you
quick
fix
for
every
problem
and
justification
for
every
selfish
desire
and
all
of
you
were
raised
with
cell
phones
and
and
and
and
able
to
call
up
fact
or
song
or
friend
with
the
click
of
button
so
used
to
instant
gratification
but
meaningful
achievement
lasting
success
it
happen
in
an
instant
not
about
luck
not
about
sudden
stroke
of
genius
not
usually
about
talent
usually
about
daily
effort
the
large
choices
and
the
small
choices
that
you
make
that
add
up
over
time
about
the
skills
you
build
and
the
knowledge
you
accumulate
and
the
energy
you
invest
in
every
task
no
matter
how
trivial
or
menial
it
may
seem
at
the
time
got
an
alum
who
plays
for
the
yankees
hear
supposed
to
be
pretty
good
now
born
playing
for
the
yankees
he
got
there
through
years
of
effort
and
his
high
school
baseball
coach
once
remarked
surprised
he
still
have
blisters
and
that
have
the
blisters
on
my
hands
from
hitting
ground
balls
just
for
he
always
wanted
more
about
one
more
turn
in
the
batting
cage
or
more
ground
balls
thomas
edison
tested
more
than
different
materials
for
just
one
tiny
part
of
the
light
bulb
that
he
invented
think
about
that
tests
first
harry
potter
book
was
rejected
times
before
it
was
finally
published
mozart
was
musical
prodigy
but
he
for
hours
each
day
accumulating
thousands
of
hours
at
the
piano
by
the
time
he
was
just
six
years
old
understand
that
your
basketball
team
did
pretty
good
first
state
champions
for
the
first
time
in
years
that
happen
by
accident
they
put
in
work
they
put
in
effort
so
today
you
all
have
rare
and
valuable
chance
to
pursue
your
own
passions
chase
your
own
dreams
without
incurring
mountain
of
debt
what
an
incredible
gift
so
got
no
excuse
for
giving
anything
less
than
your
best
effort
no
excuses
my
second
piece
of
advice
very
simple
make
excuses
take
responsibility
not
just
for
your
successes
take
responsibility
where
you
fall
short
as
well
now
the
truth
is
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
not
going
to
ace
every
class
well
maybe
will
but
but
not
going
to
ace
every
class
not
going
to
succeed
the
first
time
you
try
something
there
are
going
to
be
times
when
you
screw
up
there
will
be
times
where
you
hurt
people
you
love
there
will
be
times
where
you
make
mistake
and
you
stray
from
the
values
that
you
hold
most
deeply
and
when
that
happens
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
start
looking
around
for
somebody
else
to
blame
your
professor
was
too
hard
your
boss
was
jerk
the
coaches
was
playing
your
friend
just
understand
your
wife
oh
no
just
messing
with
right
there
that
was
all
in
fun
no
but
this
is
an
easy
habit
to
get
into
you
see
it
every
day
in
washington
every
day
folks
calling
each
other
names
making
all
sorts
of
accusations
on
television
everybody
is
always
pointing
finger
at
somebody
else
you
notice
that
now
this
community
could
have
easily
gone
down
that
road
this
community
could
have
made
excuses
well
our
kids
have
fewer
advantages
our
schools
have
fewer
resources
how
can
we
compete
you
could
have
spent
years
pointing
fingers
blaming
parents
blaming
teachers
blaming
the
principal
blaming
the
superintendent
blaming
the
president
but
class
of
want
you
to
pay
attention
on
this
because
not
what
happened
instead
this
community
was
honest
with
itself
about
where
you
were
falling
short
you
resolved
to
do
better
push
your
kids
harder
open
their
minds
wider
expose
them
to
all
kinds
of
ideas
and
people
and
experiences
so
graduates
hope
continue
those
efforts
make
excuses
and
hope
that
wherever
you
go
you
narrow
the
broad
intellectual
and
social
exposure
had
here
at
central
instead
seek
to
expand
it
just
hang
out
with
people
who
look
like
you
or
go
to
the
same
church
you
do
or
share
your
political
views
broaden
your
circle
to
include
people
with
different
backgrounds
and
life
experiences
because
how
end
up
learning
what
like
to
walk
in
somebody
shoes
how
come
to
understand
the
challenges
other
people
face
and
this
is
not
just
an
academic
exercise
way
to
broaden
your
ambit
of
concern
and
learn
to
see
yourselves
in
each
other
which
brings
me
to
my
final
piece
of
advice
for
today
and
to
give
back
to
be
part
of
something
bigger
than
yourselves
hitch
your
wagon
to
something
that
is
bigger
than
yourselves
know
that
so
many
of
you
have
already
served
your
community
through
efforts
like
your
stuff
the
bus
food
drives
and
groups
like
activists
for
action
and
commend
you
for
that
but
also
know
that
many
of
you
are
the
first
in
your
family
to
go
to
college
and
right
about
now
you
may
be
feeling
all
the
weight
of
their
hopes
and
expectations
coming
down
on
your
shoulders
and
once
you
start
juggling
those
classes
and
activities
and
that
campus
job
and
you
get
caught
up
in
your
own
dreams
and
your
own
anxieties
and
dating
you
may
feel
like
got
enough
on
your
plate
just
dealing
with
your
own
life
it
might
be
easier
to
turn
the
channel
when
the
news
disturbs
you
to
avert
your
eyes
when
you
pass
that
homeless
man
on
the
street
to
tell
yourself
that
other
problems
really
your
responsibility
but
just
think
about
what
the
consequence
of
that
approach
to
life
would
have
been
if
how
folks
had
acted
here
in
this
community
what
if
those
promise
donors
had
said
to
themselves
you
know
what
can
pay
for
my
own
education
why
should
have
to
pay
for
somebody
think
about
the
consequences
for
our
country
what
if
our
founding
fathers
had
said
know
colonialism
is
kind
of
oppressive
but
doing
okay
my
doing
all
right
why
should
spend
my
summer
in
arguing
about
constitution
what
if
those
abolitionists
those
civil
right
workers
had
said
know
slavery
is
wrong
segregation
is
wrong
but
kind
of
dangerous
to
get
mixed
up
in
that
stuff
have
time
for
all
those
meetings
and
marches
think
going
to
take
pass
hope
it
works
out
but
not
something
want
to
want
you
to
think
for
minute
about
the
extraordinary
men
and
women
worn
our
uniform
and
have
given
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
to
keep
us
safe
and
free
what
if
they
said
what
if
they
said
really
do
love
this
country
but
why
should
sacrifice
so
much
for
people
never
even
met
young
men
and
women
in
uniform
right
now
making
those
sacrifices
so
you
and
are
here
today
because
those
people
made
different
choice
they
chose
to
step
up
they
chose
to
serve
and
hope
you
will
follow
their
example
because
there
is
work
to
be
done
and
your
country
needs
you
got
an
economy
to
rebuild
got
children
to
educate
got
diseases
to
cure
got
threats
to
face
got
an
oil
spill
to
clean
up
got
clean
energy
to
discover
and
it
is
going
to
be
up
to
you
to
meet
all
of
those
challenges
to
build
industries
and
make
discoveries
and
inspire
the
next
generation
going
to
be
up
to
you
to
heal
the
divide
that
continues
to
afflict
our
world
now
not
saying
you
got
to
do
it
here
all
at
once
but
as
once
put
it
asking
you
to
what
you
can
with
what
got
where
you
and
can
guarantee
that
wherever
your
journey
takes
you
there
are
going
to
be
children
who
need
mentors
and
senior
citizens
who
need
assistance
folks
down
on
their
luck
who
could
use
helping
hand
and
once
reached
out
and
formed
those
connections
find
little
harder
to
numb
yourself
to
other
suffering
little
harder
to
ignore
the
national
debates
about
the
issues
that
affect
their
lives
and
yours
in
the
end
service
binds
us
to
each
other
and
to
our
communities
and
our
country
in
way
that
nothing
else
can
how
we
become
more
fully
american
the
reason
those
donors
created
the
promise
in
the
first
place
not
for
recognition
or
reward
but
because
of
their
connection
to
this
community
because
their
belief
in
your
potential
because
their
faith
that
you
would
use
this
gift
not
just
to
enrich
your
own
lives
but
the
lives
of
others
and
the
life
of
the
nation
and
told
that
soon
after
the
promise
was
established
first
grader
approached
the
superintendent
at
the
time
and
declared
to
her
going
to
first
grader
going
to
college
know
what
it
is
but
we
may
never
know
those
names
but
we
know
how
they
helped
bring
this
community
together
and
how
embraced
their
promise
not
just
as
gift
to
be
appreciated
but
responsibility
to
be
fulfilled
we
know
how
they
have
helped
inspire
an
entire
generation
of
young
people
here
in
to
imagine
different
future
for
themselves
and
graduates
today
asking
you
to
pay
them
back
by
seeking
to
have
the
same
kind
of
impact
with
your
own
lives
by
pursuing
excellence
in
everything
you
do
by
serving
this
country
that
you
love
know
that
you
can
do
it
after
all
you
are
the
giants
and
with
the
education
gotten
here
nothing
you
do
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
and
god
bless
the
class
of
thank
you
very
much
let
me
begin
by
thanking
and
the
entire
community
for
welcoming
me
once
again
and
for
the
terrific
work
that
he
and
the
administration
faculty
and
staff
do
here
each
and
every
day
also
want
to
acknowledge
your
outstanding
mayor
who
look
any
older
than
the
last
time
saw
him
mayor
luke
there
he
is
right
there
it
is
great
to
be
back
at
and
in
the
beautiful
city
of
love

good
sports

last
year
stole
dan
to
serve
as
my
ambassador
to
ireland
to
make
it
up
invited
both
the
and
the
penguins
to
the
white
house
to
celebrate
their
championships
seeing
how
the
are
headed
to
tonight
with
lead
in
the
cup
finals
just
glad
that
we
on
this
side
of
the
state
noticed
couple
of
people
said
they
were
rooting
for
the
which
tells
me
something
about
the
rivalry
between
and
of
course
we
meet
here
at
an
incredibly
difficult
time
for
america
among
other
things
time
when
the
worst
environmental
disaster
of
its
kind
in
our
history
is
threatening
the
gulf
coast
and
the
people
who
live
there
right
now
stopping
this
oil
spill
and
containing
its
damage
is
necessarily
the
top
priority
not
just
of
my
administration
but
think
of
the
entire
country
and
waging
this
battle
every
minute
of
every
day
but
at
the
same
time
continuing
our
efforts
to
recover
and
rebuild
from
an
economic
disaster
that
has
touched
the
lives
of
nearly
every
american
what
want
to
talk
about
today
the
state
of
our
economy
the
future
we
must
seize
and
the
path
we
chose
to
get
there
it
has
now
been
little
over
months
since
took
office
amid
one
of
the
worst
economic
storms
in
our
history
and
to
navigate
that
storm
my
administration
was
forced
to
take
some
dramatic
and
unpopular
steps
these
steps
have
succeeded
in
breaking
the
freefall
again
moving
in
the
right
direction
an
economy
that
was
shrinking
at
an
alarming
rate
when
became
president
has
now
been
growing
for
three
consecutive
quarters
after
losing
an
average
of
jobs
month
during
the
winter
of
last
year
now
added
jobs
for
five
of
the
last
six
months
and
we
expect
to
see
strong
job
growth
in
report
the
taxpayer
money
it
cost
to
shore
up
the
financial
sector
and
the
auto
industry
that
being
repaid
and
both
and
are
adding
shifts
and
operating
at
profit
so
despite
temporary
setbacks
uncertain
world
events
and
the
resulting
ups
and
downs
of
the
market
this
economy
is
getting
stronger
by
the
day
now
that
mean
this
recession
is
by
any
means
over
for
the
millions
of
americans
who
are
still
looking
for
job
or
way
to
pay
the
bills
not
by
long
shot
the
devastation
created
by
the
deepest
downturn
since
the
great
depression
has
hit
people
and
communities
across
our
country
very
hard
and
not
going
to
be
real
recovery
until
people
can
feel
it
in
their
own
lives
in
the
immediate
future
this
means
doing
whatever
is
necessary
to
keep
the
recovery
going
and
to
spur
job
growth
but
in
the
long
term
it
means
that
for
lot
of
families
for
entire
communities
in
some
case
sense
of
economic
security
has
been
missing
since
long
before
the
recession
began
over
the
last
decade
these
families
saw
their
income
decline
they
saw
the
cost
of
things
like
health
care
and
college
tuition
reach
record
highs
they
lived
through
economic
that
generated
slower
job
growth
than
at
any
prior
expansion
since
world
war
some
people
have
called
the
last
years
lost
so
the
anxiety
out
there
today
new
the
recession
has
certainly
made
it
worse
but
that
feeling
of
not
being
in
control
of
your
own
economic
future
that
sense
that
the
american
dream
might
slowly
be
slipping
away
been
around
for
some
time
now
and
for
better
or
for
worse
our
generation
of
americans
has
been
buffeted
by
tremendous
forces
of
economic
change
long
gone
are
the
days
when
high
school
diploma
could
guarantee
job
at
local
factory
not
when
so
many
of
those
factories
had
moved
overseas
city
that
once
was
defined
by
the
steel
industry
knows
this
better
than
just
about
anybody
and
today
the
ability
of
jobs
and
entire
industries
to
relocate
where
skilled
workers
and
an
internet
connection
has
forced
america
to
compete
like
never
before
from
china
to
india
to
europe
other
nations
have
already
this
putting
greater
emphasis
on
math
and
science
and
demanding
more
from
their
students
some
countries
are
building
and
expanding
broadband
access
making
serious
investments
in
technology
and
clean
energy
because
they
want
to
win
the
competition
for
those
jobs
so
we
afford
to
stand
pat
while
the
world
races
by
the
united
states
of
america
did
not
become
the
most
prosperous
nation
on
earth
by
sheer
luck
or
we
got
here
because
each
time
generation
of
americans
has
faced
changing
world
we
have
changed
with
it
we
have
not
feared
our
future
we
have
shaped
it
america
does
not
stand
still
we
move
forward
and
that
why
said
that
as
we
emerge
from
this
recession
we
afford
to
return
to
the
status
we
go
back
to
an
economy
that
was
too
dependent
on
bubbles
and
debt
and
financial
speculation
we
accept
economic
growth
that
leaves
the
middle
class
owing
more
and
making
less
we
have
to
build
new
and
stronger
foundation
for
growth
and
prosperity
and
exactly
what
been
doing
for
the
last
months
foundation
based
on
investments
in
our
people
and
their
future
investments
in
the
skills
and
education
we
need
to
compete
investments
in
century
infrastructure
for
america
from
to
internet
investments
in
research
and
technology
like
clean
energy
that
can
lead
to
new
jobs
and
new
exports
and
new
industries
this
new
foundation
is
also
based
on
reforms
that
will
make
our
economy
stronger
and
our
businesses
more
competitive
reforms
that
will
make
health
care
cheaper
our
financial
system
more
secure
and
our
government
less
burdened
with
debt
in
global
economy
we
pursue
this
agenda
in
vacuum
at
the
height
of
the
financial
crisis
the
coordinated
action
we
took
with
the
nations
of
the
prevented
global
depression
and
helped
restore
worldwide
growth
and
as
recently
witnessed
in
europe
economic
difficulties
in
one
part
of
the
world
can
affect
everybody
else
and
why
we
have
to
keep
on
working
with
the
nations
of
the
to
pursue
more
balanced
growth
why
we
need
to
coordinate
financial
reform
with
other
nations
so
that
we
avoid
global
race
to
the
bottom
why
we
need
to
open
new
markets
and
meet
the
goal
of
my
national
export
initiative
to
double
our
exports
over
the
next
five
years
and
why
we
need
to
ensure
that
our
competitors
play
fair
and
our
agreements
are
enforced
this
too
is
part
of
building
new
foundation
now
some
of
you
may
have
noticed
that
we
have
been
building
this
foundation
without
much
help
from
our
friends
in
the
other
party
from
our
efforts
to
rescue
the
economy
to
health
insurance
reform
to
financial
reform
most
have
sat
on
the
sidelines
and
shouted
from
the
bleachers
they
said
no
to
tax
cuts
for
small
businesses
no
to
tax
credits
for
college
tuition
no
to
investments
in
clean
energy
they
said
no
to
protecting
patients
from
insurance
companies
and
consumers
from
big
banks
and
some
of
this
of
course
is
just
politics
before
was
even
inaugurated
the
congressional
leaders
of
the
other
party
got
together
and
made
calculation
that
if
failed
win
so
when
went
to
meet
with
them
about
the
need
for
recovery
act
in
the
midst
of
crisis
they
announced
they
were
against
it
before
even
arrived
at
the
meeting
before
we
even
had
health
care
bill
republican
senator
actually
said
able
to
stop
on
this
it
will
be
his
waterloo
it
will
break
so
those
very
hopeful
signs
but
to
be
fair
good
deal
of
the
other
opposition
to
our
agenda
has
also
been
rooted
in
their
sincere
and
fundamental
belief
about
the
role
of
government
belief
that
government
has
little
or
no
role
to
play
in
helping
this
nation
meet
our
collective
challenges
an
agenda
that
basically
offers
two
answers
to
every
problem
we
face
more
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthy
and
fewer
rules
for
corporations
the
last
administration
called
this
recycled
idea
ownership
but
what
it
essentially
means
is
that
everyone
is
on
their
own
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
if
your
enough
to
pay
for
college
or
health
care
or
childcare
well
on
your
own
if
misfortune
causes
you
to
lose
your
job
or
your
home
on
your
own
and
if
wall
street
bank
or
an
insurance
company
or
an
oil
company
you
pretty
much
get
to
play
by
your
own
rules
regardless
of
the
consequences
for
everybody
else
now
never
believed
that
government
has
all
the
answers
government
can
not
and
should
not
replace
businesses
as
the
true
engine
of
growth
and
job
creation
government
good
values
and
sense
of
responsibility
in
our
children
that
job
too
much
government
can
deprive
us
of
choice
and
burden
us
with
debt
poorly
designed
regulations
can
choke
off
competition
and
the
capital
that
businesses
need
to
thrive
understand
these
arguments
and
reflected
in
my
policies
after
all
of
the
recovery
act
we
designed
was
made
up
of
tax
cuts
for
families
and
small
businesses
and
when
you
think
back
to
the
health
care
debate
despite
calls
for
health
care
plan
we
passed
reform
that
maintains
our
system
of
private
health
insurance
but
also
understand
that
throughout
our
history
we
have
balanced
the
threat
of
overreaching
government
against
the
dangers
of
an
unfettered
market
we
provided
basic
safety
net
because
any
one
of
us
might
experience
hardship
at
some
time
in
our
lives
and
may
need
some
help
getting
back
on
our
feet
and
we
that
there
have
been
times
when
only
government
has
been
able
to
do
what
individuals
could
do
and
corporations
would
do
that
how
we
have
and
highways
public
schools
and
police
forces
that
how
we
made
possible
scientific
research
that
has
led
to
medical
breakthroughs
like
the
vaccine
for
hepatitis
and
technological
wonders
like
that
how
we
have
social
security
and
minimum
wage
and
laws
to
protect
the
food
we
eat
and
the
water
we
drink
and
the
air
that
we
breathe
how
we
have
rules
to
ensure
that
mines
are
safe
and
yes
that
oil
companies
pay
for
the
spills
that
they
cause
now
there
have
always
been
those
said
no
to
such
protections
no
to
such
investments
there
were
accusations
that
social
security
would
lead
to
socialism
and
that
was
government
takeover
there
were
bankers
who
claimed
the
creation
of
federal
deposit
insurance
would
destroy
the
industry
and
there
were
who
argued
that
installing
was
unnecessary
and
unaffordable
there
were
who
thought
that
cleaning
our
water
and
our
air
would
bankrupt
our
entire
economy
and
all
of
these
claims
proved
false
all
of
these
reforms
led
to
greater
security
and
greater
prosperity
for
our
people
and
our
economy
so
what
was
true
then
is
true
today
as
november
approaches
leaders
in
the
other
party
will
campaign
furiously
on
the
same
economic
arguments
been
making
for
decades
fortunately
we
do
have
to
look
back
too
many
years
to
see
how
their
agenda
turns
out
for
much
of
the
last
years
we
tried
it
their
way
they
gave
us
tax
cuts
that
paid
for
to
millionaires
who
need
them
they
gutted
regulations
and
put
industry
insiders
in
charge
of
industry
oversight
they
investments
in
clean
energy
and
education
in
research
and
technology
and
despite
all
their
current
about
the
need
to
curb
spending
this
is
the
same
crowd
who
took
the
record
billion
surplus
that
president
left
them
and
turned
it
into
record
trillion
deficit
so
we
know
where
those
ideas
lead
us
and
now
we
have
choice
as
nation
we
can
return
to
the
failed
economic
policies
of
the
past
or
we
can
keep
building
stronger
future
we
can
go
backward
or
we
can
keep
moving
forward
and
do
know
about
you
but
want
to
move
forward
think
america
wants
to
move
forward
now
the
first
step
in
building
new
foundation
that
allows
us
to
move
forward
has
been
to
address
the
costs
and
risks
that
have
made
our
economy
less
competitive
outdated
regulations
crushing
health
care
costs
and
growing
debt
to
start
with
we
compete
as
nation
if
the
irresponsibility
of
few
folks
on
wall
street
can
bring
our
entire
economy
to
its
knees
that
why
we
on
the
verge
of
passing
the
most
sweeping
financial
reform
since
the
great
depression
reform
that
will
help
prevent
another
it
will
end
bank
it
contains
the
strongest
consumer
protections
in
history
protections
that
will
empower
americans
with
the
clear
and
concise
information
they
need
before
signing
up
for
credit
card
or
taking
out
mortgage
financial
reform
will
not
guard
against
every
instance
of
greed
and
irresponsibility
on
wall
street
but
it
will
enshrine
new
principle
in
our
financial
system
from
now
on
instead
of
competing
to
see
who
can
come
up
with
the
cleverest
scheme
to
make
the
quickest
buck
financial
institutions
will
compete
to
see
who
can
make
the
better
product
and
the
better
service
and
that
competition
that
benefits
wall
street
and
main
street
why
we
need
to
get
this
legislation
done
why
we
afford
to
go
back
we
have
to
move
forward
we
also
know
we
compete
in
global
economy
if
our
citizens
are
forced
to
spend
more
and
more
of
their
income
on
medical
bills
if
our
businesses
are
forced
to
choose
between
health
care
and
hiring
if
state
and
federal
budgets
are
weighed
down
with
health
care
costs
why
we
finally
passed
health
insurance
reform
now
be
clear
the
costs
of
health
care
are
not
going
to
come
down
overnight
just
because
legislation
passed
and
in
an
industry
like
health
care
going
to
continuously
need
to
apply
more
measures
as
the
years
go
by
but
once
this
reform
is
in
full
effect
families
will
pay
less
for
their
health
care
and
the
worst
practices
of
the
insurance
industry
will
end
people
with
medical
conditions
will
no
longer
be
excluded
from
coverage
people
who
become
seriously
ill
will
no
longer
be
thrown
off
their
coverage
for
reasons
contrived
by
the
insurance
company
taxpayers
will
no
longer
have
to
pay
in
the
form
of
higher
premiums
for
trips
to
the
by
uninsured
americans
businesses
will
get
help
with
their
health
care
costs
in
fact
small
businesses
are
already
learning
eligible
for
tax
credits
to
cover
their
workers
this
year
and
with
less
waste
and
greater
efficiency
in
the
system
this
reform
will
do
more
to
bring
down
the
deficit
than
any
step
we
have
taken
in
more
than
decade
the
other
party
has
staked
their
claim
this
november
on
repealing
these
health
insurance
reforms
instead
of
making
them
work
they
want
to
go
back
we
need
to
move
forward
making
health
care
more
is
critical
because
also
true
that
we
can
not
be
competitive
as
nation
if
we
remain
dragged
down
by
our
growing
debt
so
let
me
talk
about
debt
just
for
second
by
the
time
took
office
we
had
deficit
of
over
trillion
and
projected
deficits
of
trillion
over
the
next
decade
most
of
this
was
the
result
of
not
paying
for
two
major
tax
cuts
skewed
to
the
wealthy
and
worthy
but
expensive
prescription
drug
program
that
paid
for
always
find
it
interesting
that
the
same
people
who
participated
in
these
decisions
are
the
ones
who
now
charge
our
administration
with
fiscal
irresponsibility
and
the
truth
is
if
had
taken
office
in
ordinary
times
would
have
liked
nothing
more
than
to
start
bringing
down
the
deficits
that
they
created
but
we
took
office
amid
crisis
and
the
effects
of
the
recession
put
trillion
hole
in
our
budget
before
even
walked
through
the
door
additionally
the
steps
that
we
had
to
take
to
save
the
economy
from
depression
temporarily
added
more
to
the
deficit
by
about
trillion
of
course
if
we
had
into
depression
our
deficits
and
debt
levels
would
be
much
worse
now
the
economy
is
still
fragile
so
we
put
on
the
brakes
too
quickly
we
have
to
do
what
it
takes
to
ensure
strong
recovery
growing
economy
will
unquestionably
improve
our
fiscal
health
as
will
the
steps
we
take
in
the
to
put
americans
back
to
work
and
why
signed
bill
that
will
provide
tax
cuts
for
small
businesses
that
hire
unemployed
workers
that
why
urged
congress
to
pass
small
business
lending
fund
so
that
small
businesses
can
get
the
credit
they
need
to
create
jobs
and
grow
that
why
believe
critical
we
extend
unemployment
insurance
for
several
more
months
so
that
americans
been
laid
off
through
no
fault
of
their
own
get
the
support
they
need
to
provide
for
their
families
and
can
maintain
their
health
insurance
until
and
we
have
to
work
with
state
and
local
governments
to
make
sure
they
have
the
resources
to
prevent
the
likely
layoffs
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
public
school
teachers
across
the
country
over
the
next
few
months
but
as
we
look
ahead
we
lose
sight
of
the
urgent
need
to
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
there
are
four
key
components
to
putting
our
budget
on
sustainable
path
maintaining
economic
growth
is
number
one
health
care
reform
is
number
two
the
third
component
is
the
steps
already
outlined
to
reduce
our
deficit
by
trillion
starting
in
we
will
enact
freeze
on
all
discretionary
spending
outside
of
national
security
something
that
was
never
enacted
in
the
last
administration
we
will
allow
the
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthiest
americans
to
expire
gone
through
the
budget
line
by
line
and
identified
more
than
programs
for
elimination
restored
simple
budgeting
rule
that
every
family
and
business
understands
called
and
we
will
charge
the
largest
wall
street
firms
fee
to
repay
the
american
people
for
rescuing
them
during
the
financial
crisis
fee
that
will
bring
down
the
deficit
by
billion
fee
that
will
bring
down
the
deficit
by
billion
over
the
next
decade
by
the
way
that
billion
represents
about
of
the
amount
these
banks
will
pay
out
in
bonuses
over
the
same
time
period
in
time
now
finally
the
fourth
component
in
improving
our
fiscal
health
is
the
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
that
established
that
will
provide
specific
set
of
solutions
by
the
fall
to
deal
with
our
and
deficit
and
have
to
warn
you
this
will
not
be
easy
know
that
some
like
to
make
the
argument
that
if
we
would
just
eliminate
pork
barrel
projects
and
foreign
aid
we
could
eliminate
our
deficit
turns
out
such
spending
makes
up
just
percent
of
our
deficit
you
combine
all
foreign
aid
and
all
percent
of
our
budget
so
meeting
the
deficit
challenge
will
require
some
very
difficult
decisions
about
the
largely
popular
programs
that
make
up
the
other
percent
it
means
have
to
sort
through
our
priorities
and
figure
out
what
programs
that
we
can
do
without
on
this
point
strongly
agree
with
my
friends
in
the
other
party
what
agree
with
is
the
notion
that
we
should
also
sacrifice
critical
investments
in
our
people
and
our
future
you
know
if
family
tightening
your
belt
you
will
definitely
sacrifice
going
out
to
dinner
but
not
going
to
sacrifice
saving
for
your
college
education
precisely
our
investments
in
education
and
innovation
that
will
make
america
more
competitive
in
the
century
and
we
go
back
got
to
move
forward
why
made
education
reform
top
priority
because
countries
that
us
today
will
us
tomorrow
and
so
we
want
every
citizen
to
have
the
skills
and
training
they
need
in
global
economy
from
the
day
that
born
through
whatever
career
you
may
choose
last
year
we
launched
national
competition
to
improve
our
schools
based
on
simple
idea
instead
of
funding
the
status
we
will
only
invest
in
reform
reform
that
raises
student
achievement
that
inspires
students
to
excel
in
math
and
science
and
turns
around
failing
schools
that
steal
the
future
of
too
many
young
americans
and
to
achieve
my
goal
of
ensuring
america
once
more
has
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
by
we
passed
law
that
will
make
college
more
affordable
by
ending
the
unnecessary
taxpayer
subsidies
that
go
to
financial
institutions
for
student
loans
that
means
saving
billions
of
dollars
that
will
go
directly
to
students
including
students
right
here
at
bill
that
will
also
our
community
colleges
which
are
career
pathway
to
the
children
of
so
many
working
families
in
addition
to
training
our
workers
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
also
investing
in
the
innovation
that
will
create
those
jobs
here
in
america
the
research
the
technology
the
infrastructure
that
will
secure
our
economic
future
right
now
as
we
speak
the
recovery
act
is
putting
americans
to
work
building
century
america
no
reason
china
should
have
the
fastest
trains
or
that
rural
should
be
without
internet
access
got
to
make
those
investments
from
the
first
to
the
highway
system
this
nation
has
always
been
built
to
compete
so
going
to
invest
and
are
investing
right
now
in
new
infrastructure
expanding
broadband
health
information
technology
advanced
manufacturing
facilities
first
rail
network
also
investing
in
the
ideas
and
technologies
that
will
lead
to
new
jobs
and
entire
new
industries
consider
what
done
with
clean
energy
the
tax
credits
and
loan
guarantees
in
the
recovery
act
alone
will
lead
to
clean
energy
jobs
in
america
by
give
you
one
example
the
united
states
used
to
make
less
than
percent
of
the
advanced
batteries
for
hybrid
cars
by
because
of
the
investments
that
we
made
have
enough
capacity
to
make
up
to
percent
of
these
batteries
now
this
brings
me
to
an
issue
on
minds
right
now
namely
what
kind
of
energy
future
can
ensure
our
prosperity
the
catastrophe
unfolding
in
the
gulf
right
now
may
prove
to
be
result
of
human
error
or
of
corporations
taking
dangerous
shortcuts
to
compromise
safety
or
combination
of
both
and
launched
national
commission
so
that
the
american
people
will
have
answers
on
exactly
what
happened
but
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
inherent
risks
to
drilling
four
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
these
are
risks
these
are
risks
that
are
bound
to
increase
the
harder
oil
extraction
becomes
we
also
have
to
acknowledge
that
an
america
run
solely
on
fossil
fuels
should
not
be
the
vision
we
have
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
we
consume
more
than
percent
of
the
oil
but
have
less
than
percent
of
the
oil
reserves
so
without
major
change
in
our
energy
policy
our
dependence
on
oil
means
that
we
will
continue
to
send
billions
of
dollars
of
our
wealth
to
other
countries
every
month
including
countries
in
dangerous
and
unstable
regions
in
other
words
our
continued
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
will
our
national
security
it
will
smother
our
planet
and
it
will
continue
to
put
our
economy
and
our
environment
at
risk
now
understand
that
we
end
our
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
overnight
why
supported
careful
plan
of
offshore
oil
production
as
one
part
of
our
overall
energy
strategy
but
we
can
pursue
such
production
only
if
safe
and
only
if
used
as
solution
while
we
transition
to
clean
energy
economy
and
the
time
has
come
to
aggressively
accelerate
that
transition
the
time
has
come
once
and
for
all
for
this
nation
to
fully
embrace
clean
energy
future
now
that
means
continuing
our
unprecedented
effort
to
make
everything
from
our
homes
and
businesses
to
our
cars
and
trucks
more
it
means
tapping
into
our
natural
gas
reserves
and
moving
ahead
with
our
plan
to
expand
our
fleet
of
nuclear
power
plants
it
means
rolling
back
billions
of
dollars
of
tax
breaks
to
oil
companies
so
we
can
investments
in
clean
energy
research
and
development
but
the
only
way
the
transition
to
clean
energy
will
ultimately
succeed
is
if
the
private
sector
is
fully
invested
in
this
future
if
capital
comes
off
the
sidelines
and
the
ingenuity
of
our
entrepreneurs
is
unleashed
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
by
finally
putting
price
on
carbon
pollution
no
many
businesses
have
already
embraced
this
idea
because
it
provides
level
of
certainty
about
the
future
and
for
those
that
face
transition
costs
we
can
help
them
adjust
but
if
we
refuse
to
take
into
account
the
full
costs
of
our
fossil
fuel
addiction
if
we
factor
in
the
environmental
costs
and
the
national
security
costs
and
the
true
economic
costs
we
will
have
missed
our
best
chance
to
seize
clean
energy
future
the
house
of
representatives
has
already
passed
comprehensive
energy
and
climate
bill
and
there
is
currently
plan
in
the
senate
plan
that
was
developed
with
ideas
from
democrats
and
republicans
that
would
achieve
the
same
goal
and
want
you
to
know
the
votes
may
not
be
there
right
now
but
intend
to
find
them
in
the
coming
months
will
continue
to
make
the
case
for
clean
energy
future
wherever
and
whenever
can
will
work
with
anyone
to
get
this
done
and
we
will
get
it
done
the
next
generation
will
not
be
held
hostage
to
energy
sources
from
the
last
century
we
are
not
going
to
move
backwards
we
are
going
to
move
forward
this
principle
that
we
must
invest
in
and
embrace
the
innovation
and
technology
of
the
future
and
not
the
past
that
applies
beyond
our
energy
policy
why
decided
to
devote
more
than
percent
of
our
to
research
and
development
to
spur
the
discovery
of
services
and
products
and
businesses
that
we
have
yet
to
imagine
proposed
making
the
research
and
experimentation
tax
credit
permanent
tax
credit
that
helps
businesses
afford
the
high
costs
of
developing
new
technologies
and
new
products
last
year
we
made
the
largest
investment
in
basic
research
funding
in
history
the
possibilities
of
where
this
research
might
lead
are
endless
imagine
new
treatment
that
kills
cancer
cells
but
leaves
healthy
ones
untouched
regenerative
medicine
that
ends
the
wait
for
an
organ
transplant
imagine
lightweight
vest
for
soldiers
and
police
officers
that
can
stop
bullets
educational
software
as
effective
and
engaging
as
personal
tutor
intelligent
that
can
enable
wounded
veteran
to
play
the
piano
again
and
now
imagine
all
the
workers
and
small
business
owners
and
consumers
who
would
benefit
from
these
discoveries
we
know
for
certain
what
the
future
will
bring
we
guess
with
percent
accuracy
what
industries
and
innovations
will
next
shape
our
world
sure
there
were
times
when
this
city
imagine
life
without
steel
mills
and
heavy
smog
that
filled
these
streets
and
when
that
industry
shrank
and
so
many
jobs
were
lost
who
could
have
guessed
that
would
fare
better
than
many
other
rust
belt
cities
and
as
for
technology
and
green
jobs
health
care
and
education
who
would
have
thought
that
the
university
of
medical
logo
would
one
day
adorn
the
steel
tower
or
that
this
institute
would
be
the
largest
employer
all
of
this
came
to
be
because
as
community
you
prepared
and
adapted
and
invested
in
better
future
even
if
you
always
sure
what
that
future
would
look
like
and
what
america
does
what
always
done
the
interests
of
the
status
will
always
have
the
most
vocal
and
powerful
defenders
at
every
level
of
government
there
will
always
be
lobbyists
for
the
banks
or
the
insurance
industry
that
want
more
regulation
or
the
corporation
that
would
prefer
to
see
more
tax
breaks
instead
of
more
investments
in
infrastructure
or
education
and
face
it
lot
of
us
find
the
prospect
of
change
scary
even
when
we
know
the
status
working
for
us
but
no
natural
lobby
for
the
clean
energy
company
that
may
start
few
years
from
now
no
natural
lobby
for
the
research
that
may
lead
to
lifesaving
medical
breakthrough
no
natural
lobby
for
the
student
who
may
not
be
able
to
afford
college
education
but
if
they
got
one
could
end
up
making
discoveries
that
would
transform
america
and
the
world
our
job
as
nation
to
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
america
that
we
hope
for
to
make
decisions
that
will
benefit
the
next
generation
even
if
not
always
popular
even
if
we
always
see
those
benefits
in
the
we
make
decisions
like
this
on
behalf
of
our
own
children
every
single
day
and
while
harder
to
do
with
an
entire
country
as
large
and
diverse
as
ours
no
less
important
the
role
of
government
has
never
been
to
plan
every
detail
or
dictate
every
outcome
at
its
best
government
has
simply
knocked
away
barriers
to
opportunity
and
laid
the
foundation
for
better
future
our
people
with
all
their
drive
and
ingenuity
always
end
up
building
the
rest
and
if
we
can
do
that
again
if
we
can
continue
building
that
foundation
and
making
those
hard
decisions
on
behalf
of
the
next
generation
have
no
doubt
that
we
will
leave
our
children
the
america
that
we
all
hope
for
thank
you
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
afternoon
everybody
know
little
warm
out
here
so
want
to
get
started
just
had
meeting
with
these
governors
members
of
congress
local
officials
as
well
as
admiral
the
national
incident
commander
in
charge
of
response
efforts
to
the
oil
spill
admiral
gave
us
an
update
the
latest
information
on
both
the
efforts
to
plug
the
well
as
well
as
giving
us
an
update
on
arrangements
and
coordination
that
being
made
with
respect
to
mitigating
this
damage
that
been
done
he
updated
us
on
these
latest
efforts
to
stop
the
leak
mitigate
the
damage
to
the
great
beaches
of
the
gulf
coast
and
had
the
chance
to
visit
with
beach
like
port
that
gives
you
sense
of
what
extraordinary
efforts
are
being
made
at
the
local
level
but
also
the
damage
that
we
already
starting
to
see
as
consequence
of
this
spill
now
our
mission
remains
the
same
as
it
has
since
this
disaster
began
since
the
day
visited
nearly
four
weeks
ago
we
want
to
stop
the
leak
we
want
to
contain
and
clean
up
the
oil
and
we
want
to
help
the
people
of
this
region
return
to
their
lives
and
their
livelihoods
as
soon
as
possible
and
our
response
treats
this
event
for
what
it
is
an
assault
on
our
shores
on
our
people
on
the
regional
economy
and
on
communities
like
this
one
this
just
mess
that
got
to
mop
up
people
are
watching
their
livelihoods
wash
up
on
the
beach
parents
are
worried
about
the
implications
for
their
health
every
resident
of
this
community
has
watched
this
nightmare
threaten
the
dreams
that
worked
so
hard
to
build
and
they
want
it
made
right
and
they
want
to
make
it
right
now
just
had
chance
to
listen
to
mayor
david
of
isle
our
host
here
telling
us
heartbreaking
stories
about
fishermen
who
are
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
next
is
going
to
come
from
how
are
they
going
to
pay
mortgage
or
note
on
their
boat
and
he
is
having
to
dig
into
his
pocket
at
this
point
to
make
sure
that
some
of
them
are
able
to
deal
with
the
economic
impact
so
this
is
something
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
immediately
not
sometime
later
and
driving
focus
everybody
who
is
standing
behind
me
this
is
our
highest
priority
and
it
deserves
response
that
is
equal
to
the
task
why
this
has
already
been
the
largest
cleanup
effort
in
history
on
the
day
this
disaster
began
even
as
we
launched
search
and
rescue
effort
for
workers
on
the
drilling
rig
we
were
already
staging
equipment
in
the
event
of
spill
by
the
time
we
discovered
the
third
breach
week
after
the
horizon
platform
sank
we
had
already
stationed
more
than
vessels
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
feet
of
protective
boom
on
site
today
there
are
more
than
people
in
the
region
working
around
the
clock
to
contain
and
clean
up
this
spill
activated
about
members
of
the
national
guard
across
four
states
nearly
vessels
are
aiding
in
the
containment
and
cleanup
effort
and
we
deployed
more
than
million
feet
of
hard
and
boom
including
an
additional
just
yesterday
for
these
parishes
in
that
face
the
greatest
threat
now
made
clear
to
admiral
and
did
so
again
today
that
he
should
get
whatever
he
needs
to
deal
with
this
crisis
whatever
he
needs
he
will
get
right
now
still
within
the
window
where
we
yet
know
the
outcome
of
the
highly
complex
top
kill
procedure
that
the
federal
government
to
use
to
try
to
stop
the
leak
if
it
is
successful
it
would
obviously
be
welcome
news
if
not
team
of
some
of
the
top
scientists
engineers
and
experts
led
by
our
energy
secretary
and
physicist
has
for
some
time
being
has
for
some
time
been
exploring
any
and
all
reasonable
contingency
plans
but
our
response
will
continue
with
its
full
force
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
top
kill
approach
because
even
if
the
leak
was
stopped
today
it
change
the
fact
that
these
waters
still
contain
oil
from
what
is
now
the
largest
spill
in
american
history
and
more
of
it
will
come
ashore
to
ensure
that
fully
prepared
for
that
and
in
accordance
with
input
from
folks
down
here
directed
secretary
and
admiral
to
triple
the
manpower
in
places
where
oil
has
hit
the
shore
or
is
within
hours
of
impact
this
increase
will
allow
us
to
further
intensify
this
already
historic
response
contain
and
remove
oil
more
quickly
and
help
the
time
that
any
oil
comes
into
contact
with
our
coastline
that
means
deploying
more
boom
cleaning
more
beaches
performing
more
monitoring
of
wildlife
and
impact
to
this
ecosystem
also
going
to
continue
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
help
americans
whose
livelihoods
have
been
upended
by
this
spill
gulf
coast
residents
should
know
that
gathered
all
pertinent
information
regarding
available
assistance
and
the
federal
response
in
one
place
at
we
have
ordered
to
pay
economic
injury
claims
and
we
will
make
sure
they
deliver
and
the
parish
presidents
and
governors
here
in
were
already
giving
us
some
sense
of
some
of
the
bureaucratic
problems
that
going
to
have
to
cut
through
but
we
are
going
to
cut
through
them
and
for
those
who
are
in
economic
distress
if
already
filed
claim
and
not
satisfied
with
the
resolution
then
will
point
you
in
the
right
direction
as
said
yesterday
the
small
business
administration
has
stepped
in
to
help
businesses
by
approving
loans
but
also
as
important
allowing
many
to
defer
existing
loan
payments
lot
of
folks
are
still
loaded
up
with
loans
that
they
had
from
and
other
natural
disasters
down
here
so
they
may
need
some
additional
help
if
small
business
owner
and
you
aware
of
some
of
the
programs
that
have
been
put
in
place
or
participated
then
again
the
white
house
website
will
connect
you
to
the
resources
you
need
and
we
are
making
sure
that
all
the
parish
presidents
know
and
folks
like
the
mayor
other
local
officials
are
going
to
be
aware
of
how
they
can
get
immediate
help
from
us
more
stationed
doctors
and
scientists
across
the
five
gulf
states
to
look
out
for
health
and
then
to
monitor
any
ill
effects
felt
by
cleanup
workers
and
local
residents
and
begun
setting
up
system
to
track
these
efforts
excuse
me
to
track
these
effects
and
ensure
folks
get
the
care
that
they
need
and
told
that
we
expect
them
to
pay
for
that
too
as
said
before
is
the
responsible
party
for
this
disaster
what
that
means
is
legally
responsible
for
stopping
the
leak
and
financially
responsible
for
the
enormous
damage
that
created
and
going
to
hold
them
accountable
along
with
any
other
party
responsible
for
the
initial
explosion
and
loss
of
life
on
that
platform
but
as
said
yesterday
and
as
repeated
in
the
meeting
that
we
just
left
ultimately
take
responsibility
for
solving
this
crisis
the
president
and
the
buck
stops
with
me
so
give
the
people
of
this
community
and
the
entire
gulf
my
word
that
going
to
hold
ourselves
accountable
to
do
whatever
it
takes
for
as
long
as
it
takes
to
stop
this
catastrophe
to
defend
our
natural
resources
to
repair
the
damage
and
to
keep
this
region
on
its
feet
justice
will
be
done
for
those
whose
lives
have
been
upended
by
this
disaster
for
the
families
of
those
whose
lives
have
been
lost
that
is
solemn
pledge
that
am
making
think
can
speak
for
anybody
here
and
for
anybody
who
has
been
involved
in
the
response
and
the
cleanup
effort
and
for
most
americans
when
say
that
would
gladly
do
whatever
it
takes
to
end
this
disaster
today
but
want
to
also
repeat
something
that
said
to
the
group
as
whole
while
we
were
meeting
this
is
manmade
catastrophe
still
evolving
and
we
face
recovery
and
restoration
effort
america
has
never
experienced
an
event
like
this
before
and
that
means
that
as
we
respond
to
it
not
every
judgment
we
make
is
going
to
be
right
the
first
time
out
sometimes
there
are
going
to
be
disagreements
between
experts
or
between
federal
and
state
and
local
officials
or
among
state
officials
or
between
states
about
what
the
most
effective
measures
will
be
sometimes
there
are
going
to
be
risks
and
unintended
consequences
associated
with
particular
mitigation
strategy
that
we
consider
in
other
words
there
are
going
to
be
lot
of
judgment
calls
involved
here
there
are
not
going
to
be
silver
bullets
or
lot
of
perfect
answers
for
some
of
the
challenges
that
we
face
understandably
the
feelings
of
frustration
and
anger
the
sense
that
any
response
is
inadequate
we
expect
that
frustration
and
anger
to
continue
until
we
actually
solve
this
problem
but
in
the
meantime
got
to
make
sure
that
everybody
is
working
in
concert
that
everybody
is
moving
in
the
same
direction
and
want
everybody
to
know
that
everybody
here
at
every
level
is
working
night
and
day
to
end
this
crisis
considering
every
single
idea
out
there
especially
from
folks
who
know
these
communities
best
admiral
announced
yesterday
for
example
that
after
bunch
of
between
state
and
federal
experts
he
is
prepared
to
moving
forward
with
portion
of
the
idea
for
barrier
island
that
may
stop
some
of
the
oil
from
coming
ashore
we
had
an
extensive
conversation
about
this
and
to
see
whether
additional
steps
can
be
taken
on
this
barrier
island
idea
and
what
told
the
parish
president
what
told
the
governor
is
that
if
there
is
an
idea
that
can
be
shown
to
work
then
we
should
move
forward
on
it
and
they
deserve
quick
answers
but
also
reminded
everybody
that
got
to
make
sure
that
whatever
we
do
is
actually
going
to
work
particularly
because
going
to
have
not
unlimited
resources
at
least
not
right
now
for
example
limited
amount
of
boom
going
to
try
to
get
more
boom
manufactured
but
that
may
take
some
time
and
that
means
going
to
have
to
make
some
decisions
about
how
to
deploy
it
effectively
the
bottom
line
is
this
every
decision
we
make
is
based
on
single
criterion
going
to
best
protect
and
make
whole
the
people
and
the
ecosystems
of
the
gulf
and
want
to
thank
everybody
in
this
region
rolled
up
their
sleeves
and
pitched
in
to
help
from
the
national
guard
putting
their
experience
to
the
task
to
the
local
officials
and
every
citizen
who
loves
this
area
and
calls
it
home
every
american
to
the
region
to
lend
hand
if
any
american
is
looking
for
ways
to
volunteer
and
help
then
put
links
to
that
information
on
our
website
as
well
that
and
all
these
governors
bobby
as
well
as
charlie
and
bob
they
want
and
know
is
not
here
but
think
he
agrees
with
this
as
well
one
of
the
powerful
ways
that
you
can
help
the
gulf
right
now
is
to
visit
the
communities
and
the
beaches
off
of
the
coast
except
for
three
beaches
here
in
all
of
the
beaches
at
this
moment
are
open
they
are
safe
and
they
are
clean
and
so
that
always
good
way
to
help
is
to
come
down
and
provide
support
to
the
communities
along
the
coasts
to
the
people
of
the
gulf
coast
know
that
weathered
your
fair
share
of
trials
and
tragedy
know
there
have
been
times
where
wondered
if
you
were
being
asked
to
face
them
alone
am
here
to
tell
you
that
not
alone
you
will
not
be
abandoned
you
will
not
be
left
behind
the
cameras
at
some
point
may
leave
the
media
may
get
tired
of
the
story
but
we
will
not
we
are
on
your
side
and
we
will
see
this
through
going
to
keep
at
this
every
day
until
the
leak
has
stopped
until
this
coastline
is
clean
and
your
communities
are
made
whole
again
my
promise
to
you
and
that
is
promise
on
behalf
of
nation
it
is
one
that
we
will
keep
and
will
make
one
last
point
and
said
this
to
every
leader
who
is
here
if
something
is
not
going
right
down
here
then
they
need
to
talk
to
and
if
not
getting
satisfaction
from
then
they
can
talk
to
me
nobody
here
who
get
in
touch
with
me
directly
if
there
is
an
idea
suggestion
or
logjam
that
needs
to
be
dealt
with
so
in
this
together
and
going
to
be
difficult
time
and
obviously
the
folks
down
here
are
going
to
be
feeling
the
brunt
of
it
but
going
to
make
sure
that
doing
everything
we
can
to
get
this
solved
as
quickly
as
possible
and
want
to
again
think
everybody
here
for
the
extraordinary
work
that
putting
in
you
underestimate
how
hard
these
folks
are
working
day
in
day
out
on
behalf
of
their
constituencies
so
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
everybody
good
afternoon
everybody
before
take
your
questions
want
to
update
the
american
people
on
the
status
of
the
oil
spill
catastrophe
that
is
causing
tremendous
hardship
in
the
gulf
coast
damaging
precious
ecosystem
and
one
that
led
to
the
death
of
workers
who
lost
their
lives
in
the
initial
explosion
yesterday
the
federal
government
gave
approval
to
move
forward
with
procedure
known
as
to
try
to
stop
the
leak
this
involves
plugging
the
well
with
densely
packed
mud
to
prevent
any
more
oil
from
escaping
and
given
the
complexity
of
this
procedure
and
the
depth
of
the
leak
this
procedure
offers
no
guarantee
of
success
but
exploring
any
reasonable
strategies
to
try
and
save
the
gulf
from
spill
that
may
otherwise
last
until
the
relief
wells
are
finished
and
that
process
that
could
take
months
the
american
people
should
know
that
from
the
moment
this
disaster
began
the
federal
government
has
been
in
charge
of
the
response
effort
as
far
as
concerned
is
responsible
for
this
horrific
disaster
and
we
will
hold
them
fully
accountable
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
people
and
communities
by
this
tragedy
we
will
demand
that
they
pay
every
dime
they
owe
for
the
damage
done
and
the
painful
losses
that
caused
and
we
will
continue
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
unique
technology
and
expertise
they
have
to
help
stop
this
leak
but
make
no
mistake
is
operating
at
our
direction
every
key
decision
and
action
they
take
must
be
approved
by
us
in
advance
designated
admiral
who
has
nearly
four
decades
of
experience
responding
to
such
disasters
as
the
national
incident
commander
and
if
he
orders
to
do
something
to
respond
to
this
disaster
they
are
legally
bound
to
do
it
so
for
example
when
they
said
they
would
drill
one
relief
well
to
stem
this
leak
we
demanded
backup
and
ordered
them
to
drill
two
and
they
are
in
the
process
of
drilling
two
as
we
devise
strategies
to
try
and
stop
this
leak
also
relying
on
the
brightest
minds
and
most
advanced
technology
in
the
world
relying
on
team
of
scientists
and
engineers
from
our
own
national
laboratories
and
from
many
other
nations
team
led
by
our
energy
secretary
and
physicist
and
relying
on
experts
actually
dealt
with
oil
spills
from
across
the
globe
though
none
this
challenging
the
federal
government
is
also
directing
the
effort
to
contain
and
clean
up
the
damage
from
the
spill
which
is
now
the
largest
effort
of
its
kind
in
history
in
this
case
the
federal
state
and
local
governments
have
the
resources
and
expertise
to
play
an
even
more
direct
role
in
the
response
effort
and
will
be
discussing
this
further
when
make
my
second
trip
to
tomorrow
but
so
far
we
have
about
people
in
the
region
who
are
working
around
the
clock
to
contain
and
clean
up
this
oil
we
have
activated
about
members
of
the
national
guard
in
four
states
we
have
the
coast
guard
on
site
we
have
more
than
vessels
assisting
in
the
containment
and
cleanup
efforts
deployed
over
million
feet
of
total
boom
to
stop
the
oil
from
coming
on
shore
and
today
more
than
feet
of
boom
is
being
surged
to
parishes
that
are
facing
the
greatest
risk
from
the
oil
so
continue
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
protect
and
restore
the
gulf
coast
for
example
admiral
just
announced
that
moving
forward
with
section
of
governor
barrier
island
proposal
that
could
help
stop
oil
from
coming
ashore
it
will
be
built
in
an
area
that
is
most
at
risk
and
where
the
work
can
be
most
quickly
completed
also
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
help
the
men
and
women
whose
livelihoods
have
been
disrupted
and
even
destroyed
by
this
spill
everyone
from
fishermen
to
restaurant
and
hotel
owners
so
far
the
small
business
administration
has
approved
loans
and
allowed
many
small
businesses
to
defer
existing
loan
payments
at
our
insistence
is
paying
economic
injury
claims
and
make
sure
that
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
victims
of
this
disaster
will
get
the
relief
that
they
are
owed
not
going
to
abandon
our
fellow
citizens
help
them
recover
and
we
will
help
them
rebuild
and
in
the
meantime
should
also
say
that
americans
can
help
by
continuing
to
visit
the
communities
and
beaches
of
the
gulf
coast
was
talking
to
the
governors
just
couple
of
days
ago
and
they
wanted
me
to
remind
everybody
that
except
for
three
beaches
in
all
of
the
beaches
are
open
they
are
safe
and
they
are
clean
as
we
continue
our
response
effort
also
moving
quickly
on
steps
to
ensure
that
catastrophe
like
this
never
happens
again
said
before
that
producing
oil
here
in
america
is
an
essential
part
of
our
overall
energy
strategy
but
all
drilling
must
be
safe
in
recent
months
spoken
about
the
dangers
of
too
much
heard
people
speaking
about
the
dangers
of
too
much
government
regulation
and
think
we
can
all
acknowledge
there
have
been
times
in
history
when
the
government
has
overreached
but
in
this
instance
the
oil
and
sometimes
corrupt
relationship
with
government
regulators
meant
little
or
no
regulation
at
all
when
secretary
took
office
he
found
minerals
and
management
service
that
had
been
plagued
by
corruption
for
years
this
was
the
agency
charged
with
not
only
providing
permits
but
also
enforcing
laws
governing
oil
drilling
and
the
corruption
was
underscored
by
recent
inspector
report
that
covered
activity
which
occurred
prior
to
report
that
can
only
be
described
as
appalling
and
secretary
immediately
took
steps
to
clean
up
that
corruption
but
this
oil
spill
has
made
clear
that
more
reforms
are
needed
for
years
there
has
been
scandalously
close
relationship
between
oil
companies
and
the
agency
that
regulates
them
why
decided
to
separate
the
people
who
permit
the
drilling
from
those
who
regulate
and
ensure
the
safety
of
the
drilling
also
announced
that
no
new
permits
for
drilling
new
wells
will
go
forward
until
safety
and
environmental
review
was
conducted
that
review
is
now
complete
its
initial
recommendations
include
aggressive
new
operating
standards
and
requirements
for
offshore
energy
companies
which
we
will
put
in
place
additionally
after
reading
the
recommendations
with
secretary
and
other
members
of
my
administration
going
to
be
ordering
the
following
actions
first
we
will
suspend
the
planned
exploration
of
two
locations
off
the
coast
of
alaska
second
we
will
cancel
the
pending
lease
sale
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
proposed
lease
sale
off
the
coast
of
virginia
third
we
will
continue
the
existing
moratorium
and
suspend
the
issuance
of
new
permits
to
drill
new
wells
for
six
months
and
four
we
will
suspend
action
on
exploratory
wells
currently
being
drilled
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
also
been
made
clear
from
this
disaster
is
that
for
years
the
oil
and
gas
industry
has
leveraged
such
power
that
they
have
effectively
been
allowed
to
regulate
themselves
one
example
under
current
law
the
interior
department
has
only
days
to
review
an
exploration
plan
submitted
by
an
oil
company
that
leaves
no
time
for
the
appropriate
environmental
review
they
result
is
they
are
continually
waived
and
this
is
just
one
example
of
law
that
was
tailored
by
the
industry
to
serve
their
needs
instead
of
the
so
congress
needs
to
address
these
issues
as
soon
as
possible
and
my
administration
will
work
with
them
to
do
so
still
preventing
such
catastrophe
in
the
future
will
require
further
study
and
deeper
reform
why
last
friday
also
signed
an
executive
order
establishing
the
national
commission
on
the
horizon
oil
spill
and
offshore
drilling
while
there
are
number
of
ongoing
investigations
including
an
independent
review
by
the
national
academy
of
engineering
the
purpose
of
this
commission
is
to
consider
both
the
root
causes
of
the
disaster
and
offer
options
on
what
safety
and
environmental
precautions
are
necessary
if
the
laws
on
our
books
are
inadequate
to
prevent
such
spill
or
if
we
did
not
enforce
those
laws
then
want
to
know
want
to
know
what
worked
and
what
work
in
our
response
to
the
disaster
and
where
oversight
of
the
oil
and
gas
industry
broke
down
let
me
make
one
final
point
more
than
anything
else
this
economic
and
environmental
tragedy
and
tragedy
the
urgent
need
for
this
nation
to
develop
clean
renewable
sources
of
energy
doing
so
will
not
only
reduce
threats
to
our
environment
it
will
create
new
american
industry
that
can
lead
to
countless
new
businesses
and
new
jobs
talked
about
doing
this
for
decades
and
made
significant
strides
over
the
last
year
when
it
comes
to
investing
in
renewable
energy
and
energy
efficiency
the
house
of
representatives
has
already
passed
bill
that
would
finally
jumpstart
permanent
transition
to
clean
energy
economy
and
there
is
currently
plan
in
the
senate
plan
that
was
developed
with
ideas
from
democrats
and
republicans
that
would
achieve
the
same
goal
if
nothing
else
this
disaster
should
serve
as
call
that
time
to
move
forward
on
this
legislation
time
to
accelerate
the
competition
with
countries
like
china
who
have
already
the
future
lies
in
renewable
energy
and
time
to
seize
that
future
ourselves
so
call
on
democrats
and
republicans
in
congress
working
with
my
administration
to
answer
this
challenge
once
and
for
all
close
by
saying
this
this
oil
spill
is
an
unprecedented
disaster
the
fact
that
the
source
of
the
leak
is
mile
under
the
surface
where
no
human
being
can
go
has
made
it
enormously
difficult
to
stop
but
we
are
relying
on
every
resource
and
every
idea
every
expert
and
every
bit
of
technology
to
work
to
stop
it
we
will
take
ideas
from
anywhere
but
we
are
going
to
stop
it
and
know
that
lessen
the
enormous
sense
of
anger
and
frustration
felt
by
people
on
the
gulf
and
so
many
americans
every
day
see
this
leak
continue
am
angry
and
frustrated
as
well
that
this
entire
response
effort
will
continue
to
be
filtered
through
the
typical
prism
of
politics
but
not
what
care
about
right
now
what
care
about
right
now
is
the
containment
of
this
disaster
and
the
health
and
safety
and
livelihoods
of
our
in
the
gulf
coast
and
for
as
long
as
it
takes
intend
to
use
the
full
force
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
our
fellow
citizens
and
the
place
where
they
live
can
assure
you
of
that
good
morning

is
wonderful

this
day
is
tribute
to
you
as
well
the
decision
to
come
to
west
point
was
made
by
your
sons
and
daughters
but
it
was
you
who
instilled
in
them
spirit
of
service
that
has
led
them
to
this
hallowed
place
in
time
of
war
so
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
thank
you
for
your
example
and
thank
you
for
your
patriotism
to
the
united
states
corps
of
cadets
and
most
of
all
the
class
of
it
is
singular
to
serve
as
your
as
your
superintendent
indicated
under
our
constitutional
system
my
power
as
president
is
wisely
limited
but
there
are
some
areas
where
my
power
is
absolute
and
so
as
your
hereby
absolve
all
cadets
who
are
on
restriction
for
minor
conduct
will
leave
the
definition
of
minor
to
those
who
know
better
class
of
today
is
your
day
day
to
celebrate
all
that
you
achieved
in
the
finest
tradition
of
the
and
to
look
forward
to
the
important
service
that
lies
ahead
you
have
pushed
yourself
through
the
agony
of
beast
barracks
the
weeks
of
training
in
rain
and
mud
and
told
more
inspections
and
drills
than
perhaps
any
class
before
you
along
the
way
sure
you
faced
few
moments
when
you
asked
yourself
what
am
doing
here
have
those
moments
sometimes
you
trained
for
the
complexities
of
today
missions
knowing
that
success
will
be
measured
not
merely
by
performance
on
the
battlefield
but
also
by
your
understanding
of
the
cultures
and
traditions
and
languages
in
the
place
where
you
serve
you
reached
out
across
borders
with
more
international
experience
than
any
class
in
academy
history
you
not
only
attended
foreign
academies
to
forge
new
friendships
you
welcomed
into
your
ranks
cadets
from
nearly
dozen
countries
you
challenged
yourself
intellectually
in
the
sciences
and
the
humanities
in
history
and
technology
you
achieved
standard
of
academic
excellence
that
is
without
question
tying
the
record
for
the
most
scholarships
of
any
class
in
west
point
history
this
includes
your
number
one
overall
cadet
and
your
and
and
by
the
way
this
is
the
first
time
in
academy
history
where
your
two
top
awards
have
been
earned
by
female
candidates
this
fact
that
seen
in
the
faces
of
our
troops
from
baghdad
to
in
the
century
our
women
in
uniform
play
an
indispensable
role
in
our
national
and
time
and
again
they
have
proven
themselves
to
be
role
models
for
our
daughters
and
our
sons
as
students
and
as
soldiers
and
as
leaders
in
the
united
states
armed
forces
and
the
faces
in
this
stadium
show
simple
truth
america
army
represents
the
full
breadth
of
america
experience
you
come
from
every
corner
of
our
country
from
privilege
and
from
poverty
from
cities
and
small
towns
you
worship
all
of
the
great
religions
that
enrich
the
life
of
our
people
you
include
the
vast
diversity
of
race
and
ethnicity
that
is
fundamental
to
our
nation
strength
there
is
however
one
thing
that
sets
you
apart
here
in
these
quiet
hills
you
come
together
to
prepare
for
the
most
difficult
test
of
our
time
you
signed
up
knowing
your
service
would
send
you
into
harm
way
and
you
did
so
long
after
the
first
drums
of
war
were
sounded
in
you
we
see
the
commitment
of
our
country
and
timeless
virtues
that
have
served
our
nation
well
we
see
your
sense
of
duty
including
those
who
have
earned
their
right
shoulder
patch
their
right
shoulder
combat
patches
like
the
soldier
who
suffered
grenade
wound
in
iraq
yet
still
helped
his
fellow
soldiers
to
evacuate
your
first
captain
of
the
corps
of
cadets
we
see
your
sense
of
in
your
respect
for
tradition
knowing
that
you
join
long
grey
line
that
stretches
through
the
centuries
and
in
your
reverence
for
each
other
as
when
the
corps
stands
in
silence
every
time
former
cadet
makes
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for
our
nation
indeed
today
we
the
graduates
of
this
academy
who
have
given
their
lives
for
our
freedom
and
our
security
in
iraq
and
and
we
see
your
love
of
country
devotion
to
america
captured
in
the
motto
you
chose
as
class
motto
which
will
guide
your
lives
of
service
loyal
the
end
duty
love
of
country
everything
you
have
learned
here
all
that
you
achieved
here
has
prepared
you
for
today
when
you
raise
your
right
hand
when
you
take
that
oath
when
your
loved
one
or
mentor
pins
those
gold
bars
on
your
shoulders
when
you
become
at
long
last
commissioned
officers
in
the
united
states
army
this
is
the
ninth
consecutive
commencement
that
has
taken
place
at
west
point
with
our
nation
at
war
this
time
of
war
began
in
place
that
may
seem
as
far
away
from
this
peaceful
bend
in
the
river
as
anywhere
on
earth
the
war
began
only
because
our
own
cities
and
civilians
were
attacked
by
violent
extremists
who
plotted
from
distant
place
and
it
continues
only
because
that
plotting
persists
to
this
day
for
many
years
our
focus
was
on
iraq
and
year
after
year
our
troops
faced
set
of
challenges
there
that
were
as
daunting
as
they
were
complex
lesser
army
might
have
seen
its
spirit
broken
but
the
american
military
is
more
resilient
than
that
our
troops
adapted
they
persisted
they
partnered
with
coalition
and
iraqi
counterparts
and
through
their
competence
and
creativity
and
courage
we
are
poised
to
end
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
this
summer
even
as
we
transition
to
an
iraqi
lead
and
bring
our
troops
home
our
commitment
to
the
iraqi
people
endures
we
will
continue
to
advise
and
assist
iraqi
security
forces
who
are
already
responsible
for
security
in
most
of
the
country
and
strong
american
civilian
presence
will
help
iraqis
forge
political
and
economic
progress
this
will
not
be
simple
task
but
this
is
what
success
looks
like
an
iraq
that
provides
no
haven
to
terrorists
democratic
iraq
that
is
sovereign
and
stable
and
and
as
we
end
the
war
in
iraq
though
we
are
pressing
forward
in
six
months
ago
came
to
west
point
to
announce
new
strategy
for
and
pakistan
and
stand
here
humbled
by
the
knowledge
that
many
of
you
will
soon
be
serving
in
harm
way
assure
you
you
will
go
with
the
full
support
of
proud
and
grateful
nation
we
face
tough
fight
in
any
insurgency
that
is
confronted
with
direct
challenge
will
turn
to
new
tactics
and
from
to
that
is
what
the
has
done
through
assassination
and
indiscriminate
killing
and
intimidation
moreover
any
country
that
has
known
decades
of
war
will
be
tested
in
finding
political
solutions
to
its
problems
and
providing
governance
that
can
sustain
progress
and
serve
the
needs
of
its
people
so
this
war
has
changed
over
the
last
nine
years
but
it
no
less
important
than
it
was
in
those
days
after
we
toppled
the
regime
now
we
must
break
the
momentum
of
insurgency
and
train
afghan
security
forces
we
have
supported
the
election
of
sovereign
government
now
we
must
strengthen
its
capacities
we
brought
hope
to
the
afghan
people
now
we
must
see
that
their
country
does
not
fall
prey
to
our
common
enemies
cadets
there
will
be
difficult
days
ahead
we
will
adapt
we
will
persist
and
have
no
doubt
that
together
with
our
afghan
and
international
partners
we
will
succeed
in
now
even
as
we
fight
the
wars
in
front
of
us
we
also
have
to
see
the
horizon
beyond
these
wars
because
unlike
terrorist
whose
goal
is
to
destroy
our
future
will
be
defined
by
what
we
build
we
have
to
see
that
horizon
and
to
get
there
we
must
pursue
strategy
of
national
renewal
and
global
leadership
we
have
to
build
the
sources
of
america
strength
and
influence
and
shape
world
that
more
peaceful
and
more
prosperous
time
and
again
americans
have
risen
to
meet
and
to
shape
moments
of
change
this
is
one
of
those
moments
an
era
of
economic
transformation
and
individual
empowerment
of
ancient
hatreds
and
new
dangers
of
emerging
powers
and
new
global
challenges
and
we
going
to
need
all
of
you
to
help
meet
these
challenges
you
answered
the
call
you
and
all
who
wear
america
uniform
remain
the
cornerstone
of
our
national
the
anchor
of
global
security
and
through
period
when
too
many
of
our
institutions
have
acted
irresponsibly
the
american
military
has
set
standard
of
service
and
sacrifice
that
is
as
great
as
any
in
this
nation
history
now
the
rest
of
us
the
rest
of
us
must
do
our
part
and
to
do
so
we
must
first
that
our
strength
and
influence
abroad
begins
with
steps
we
take
at
home
we
must
educate
our
children
to
compete
in
an
age
where
knowledge
is
capital
and
the
marketplace
is
global
we
must
develop
clean
energy
that
can
power
new
industry
and
unbound
us
from
foreign
oil
and
preserve
our
planet
we
have
to
pursue
science
and
research
that
unlocks
wonders
as
unforeseen
to
us
today
as
the
microchip
and
the
surface
of
the
moon
were
century
ago
simply
put
american
innovation
must
be
the
foundation
of
american
power
because
at
no
time
in
human
history
has
nation
of
diminished
economic
vitality
maintained
its
military
and
political
primacy
and
so
that
means
that
the
civilians
among
us
as
parents
and
community
leaders
elected
officials
business
leaders
we
have
role
to
play
we
can
not
leave
it
to
those
in
uniform
to
defend
this
country
we
have
to
make
sure
that
america
is
building
on
its
strengths
as
we
build
these
economic
sources
of
our
strength
the
second
thing
we
must
do
is
build
and
integrate
the
capabilities
that
can
advance
our
interests
and
the
common
interests
of
human
beings
around
the
world
america
armed
forces
are
adapting
to
changing
times
but
your
efforts
have
to
be
complemented
we
will
need
the
renewed
engagement
of
our
diplomats
from
grand
capitals
to
dangerous
outposts
we
need
development
experts
who
can
support
afghan
agriculture
and
help
africans
build
the
capacity
to
feed
themselves
we
need
intelligence
agencies
that
work
seamlessly
with
their
counterparts
to
unravel
plots
that
run
from
the
mountains
of
pakistan
to
the
streets
of
our
cities
we
need
law
enforcement
that
can
strengthen
judicial
systems
abroad
and
protect
us
here
at
home
and
we
need
first
responders
who
can
act
swiftly
in
the
event
of
earthquakes
and
storms
and
disease
the
burdens
of
this
century
can
not
fall
on
our
soldiers
alone
it
also
can
not
fall
on
american
shoulders
alone
our
adversaries
would
like
to
see
america
sap
its
strength
by
our
power
and
in
the
past
we
always
had
the
foresight
to
avoid
acting
alone
we
were
part
of
the
most
powerful
wartime
coalition
in
human
history
through
world
war
we
stitched
together
community
of
free
nations
and
institutions
to
endure
and
ultimately
prevail
during
cold
war
yes
we
are
about
the
shortfalls
of
our
international
system
but
america
has
not
succeeded
by
stepping
out
of
the
currents
of
cooperation
we
have
succeeded
by
steering
those
currents
in
the
direction
of
liberty
and
justice
so
nations
thrive
by
meeting
their
responsibilities
and
face
consequences
when
they
do
so
we
have
to
shape
an
international
order
that
can
meet
the
challenges
of
our
generation
we
will
be
steadfast
in
strengthening
those
old
alliances
that
have
served
us
so
well
including
those
who
will
serve
by
your
side
in
and
around
the
globe
as
influence
extends
to
more
countries
and
capitals
we
also
have
to
build
new
partnerships
and
shape
stronger
international
standards
and
institutions
this
engagement
is
not
an
end
in
itself
the
international
order
we
seek
is
one
that
can
resolve
the
challenges
of
our
times
countering
violent
extremism
and
insurgency
stopping
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
securing
nuclear
materials
combating
changing
climate
and
sustaining
global
growth
helping
countries
feed
themselves
and
care
for
their
sick
preventing
conflict
and
healing
wounds
if
we
are
successful
in
these
tasks
that
will
lessen
conflicts
around
the
world
it
will
be
supportive
of
our
efforts
by
our
military
to
secure
our
country
more
than
anything
else
though
our
success
will
be
claimed
by
who
we
are
as
country
this
is
more
important
than
ever
given
the
nature
of
the
challenges
that
we
face
our
campaign
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
to
defeat
is
part
of
an
international
effort
that
is
necessary
and
just
but
this
is
different
kind
of
war
there
will
be
no
simple
moment
of
surrender
to
mark
the
journey
end
no
armistice
no
banner
headline
though
we
have
had
more
success
in
eliminating
leaders
in
recent
months
than
in
recent
years
they
will
continue
to
recruit
and
plot
and
exploit
our
open
society
we
see
that
in
bombs
that
go
off
in
and
we
see
it
in
attempts
to
blow
up
an
airliner
over
detroit
or
an
in
times
square
even
as
these
failed
attacks
show
that
pressure
on
networks
like
is
forcing
them
to
rely
on
terrorists
with
less
time
and
space
to
train
we
see
the
potential
duration
of
this
struggle
in
gross
distortions
of
islam
their
disrespect
for
human
life
and
their
attempt
to
prey
upon
fear
and
hatred
and
prejudice
so
the
threat
will
not
go
away
soon
but
let
be
clear
and
its
affiliates
are
small
men
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
they
lead
no
nation
they
lead
no
religion
we
need
not
give
in
to
fear
every
time
terrorist
tries
to
scare
us
we
should
not
discard
our
freedoms
because
extremists
try
to
exploit
them
we
can
not
succumb
to
division
because
others
try
to
drive
us
apart
we
are
the
united
states
of
america
we
are
the
united
states
of
america
and
we
have
repaired
our
union
and
faced
down
fascism
and
outlasted
communism
we
gone
through
turmoil
we
gone
through
civil
war
and
we
have
come
out
stronger
and
we
will
do
so
once
more
and
know
this
to
be
true
because
see
the
strength
and
resilience
of
the
american
people
terrorists
want
to
scare
us
new
yorkers
just
go
about
their
lives
unafraid
extremists
want
war
between
america
and
islam
but
muslims
are
part
of
our
national
life
including
those
who
serve
in
our
united
states
army
adversaries
want
to
divide
us
but
we
are
united
by
our
support
for
you
soldiers
who
send
clear
message
that
this
country
is
both
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
you
know
in
an
age
of
instant
access
to
information
lot
of
cynicism
in
the
news
it
easy
to
lose
perspective
in
flood
of
pictures
and
the
swirl
of
political
debate
power
and
influence
can
seem
to
ebb
and
flow
wars
and
grand
plans
can
be
deemed
won
or
lost
day
to
day
even
hour
to
hour
as
we
experience
the
immediacy
of
the
image
of
suffering
child
or
the
boasts
of
dictator
it
easy
to
give
in
to
the
belief
sometimes
that
human
progress
has
stalled
that
events
are
beyond
our
control
that
change
is
not
possible
but
this
nation
was
founded
upon
different
notion
we
believe
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
that
truth
has
bound
us
together
nation
populated
by
people
from
around
the
globe
enduring
hardship
and
achieving
greatness
as
one
people
and
that
belief
is
as
true
today
as
it
was
years
ago
it
is
belief
that
has
been
claimed
by
people
of
every
race
and
religion
in
every
region
of
the
world
can
anybody
doubt
that
this
belief
will
be
any
less
true
any
less
powerful
two
years
two
decades
or
even
two
centuries
from
now
and
so
fundamental
part
of
our
strategy
for
our
security
has
to
be
america
support
for
those
universal
rights
that
formed
the
creed
of
our
founding
and
we
will
promote
these
values
above
all
by
living
them
through
our
fidelity
to
the
rule
of
law
and
our
constitution
even
when
it
hard
even
when
we
being
attacked
even
when
we
in
the
midst
of
war
and
we
will
commit
ourselves
to
forever
pursuing
more
perfect
union
together
with
our
friends
and
allies
america
will
always
seek
world
that
extends
these
rights
so
that
when
an
individual
is
being
silenced
we
aim
to
be
her
voice
where
ideas
are
suppressed
we
provide
space
for
open
debate
where
democratic
institutions
take
hold
we
add
wind
at
their
back
when
humanitarian
disaster
strikes
we
extend
hand
where
human
dignity
is
denied
america
opposes
poverty
and
is
source
of
opportunity
that
is
who
we
are
that
is
what
we
do
we
do
so
with
no
illusions
we
understand
change
does
come
quick
we
understand
that
neither
america
nor
any
nation
can
dictate
every
outcome
beyond
its
borders
we
know
that
world
of
mortal
men
and
women
will
never
be
rid
of
oppression
or
evil
what
we
can
do
what
we
must
do
is
work
and
reach
and
fight
for
the
world
that
we
seek
all
of
us
those
in
uniform
and
those
who
are
not
and
in
preparing
for
today
turned
to
the
world
to
the
words
of
oliver
holmes
and
reflecting
on
his
civil
war
experience
he
said
and
quote
to
fight
out
war
you
must
believe
in
something
and
want
something
with
all
your
might
so
must
you
do
to
carry
anything
else
to
an
end
worth
reaching
holmes
went
on
more
than
that
you
must
be
willing
to
commit
yourself
to
course
perhaps
long
and
hard
one
without
being
able
to
foresee
exactly
where
you
will
come
out
america
does
not
fight
for
the
sake
of
fighting
we
abhor
war
as
one
who
has
never
experienced
the
field
of
battle
and
say
that
with
humility
knowing
as
general
said
the
soldier
above
all
others
prays
for
peace
we
fight
because
we
must
we
fight
to
keep
our
families
and
communities
safe
we
fight
for
the
security
of
our
allies
and
partners
because
america
believes
that
we
will
be
safer
when
our
friends
are
safer
that
we
will
be
stronger
when
the
world
is
more
just
so
cadets
long
and
hard
road
awaits
you
you
go
abroad
because
your
service
is
fundamental
to
our
security
back
home
you
go
abroad
as
representatives
of
the
values
that
this
country
was
founded
upon
and
when
you
inevitably
face
setbacks
when
the
fighting
is
fierce
or
village
elder
is
fearful
when
the
end
that
you
are
seeking
seems
uncertain
think
back
to
west
point
here
in
this
peaceful
part
of
the
world
you
have
drilled
and
you
have
studied
and
come
of
age
in
the
footsteps
of
great
men
and
women
americans
who
faced
times
of
trial
and
who
even
in
victory
could
not
have
foreseen
the
america
they
helped
to
build
the
world
they
helped
to
shape
george
washington
was
able
to
free
band
of
patriots
from
the
rule
of
an
empire
but
he
could
not
have
foreseen
his
country
growing
to
include
states
connecting
two
oceans
grant
was
able
to
save
union
and
see
the
slaves
freed
but
he
could
not
have
foreseen
just
how
much
his
country
would
extend
full
rights
and
opportunities
to
citizens
of
every
was
able
to
see
germany
surrender
and
former
enemy
grow
into
an
ally
but
he
could
not
have
foreseen
the
berlin
wall
coming
down
without
shot
being
fired
today
it
is
your
generation
that
has
borne
heavy
burden
soldiers
graduates
of
this
academy
like
john
and
ambrosia
who
have
braved
enemy
fire
protected
their
units
carried
out
their
missions
earned
the
commendation
of
this
army
and
of
grateful
nation
from
the
birth
of
our
existence
america
has
had
faith
in
the
future
belief
that
where
we
going
is
better
than
where
we
been
even
when
the
path
ahead
is
uncertain
to
that
promise
generations
of
americans
have
built
upon
the
foundation
of
our
forefathers
finding
opportunity
fighting
injustice
forging
more
perfect
union
our
achievement
would
not
be
possible
without
the
long
grey
line
that
has
sacrificed
for
duty
for
for
country
and
years
from
now
when
you
return
here
when
for
you
the
shadows
have
grown
longer
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
have
added
your
name
to
the
book
of
history
have
no
doubt
that
we
will
have
prevailed
in
the
struggles
of
our
times
have
no
doubt
that
your
legacy
will
be
an
america
that
has
emerged
stronger
and
world
that
is
more
just
because
we
are
americans
and
our
destiny
is
never
written
for
us
it
is
written
by
us
and
we
are
ready
to
lead
once
more
thank
you
may
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
everybody
please
have
seat
good
morning
everybody
of
the
many
responsibilities
accorded
to
president
by
our
constitution
few
are
more
weighty
or
consequential
than
that
of
appointing
supreme
court
justice
particularly
one
to
succeed
giant
in
the
law
like
justice
john
paul
for
nearly
years
justice
has
stood
as
an
impartial
guardian
of
the
law
faithfully
applying
the
core
values
of
our
founding
to
the
cases
and
controversies
of
our
time
he
has
done
so
with
restraint
and
respect
for
precedent
understanding
that
job
is
to
interpret
not
make
law
but
also
with
fidelity
to
the
constitutional
ideal
of
equal
justice
for
all
brought
to
each
case
not
just
mastery
of
the
letter
of
the
law
but
keen
understanding
of
its
impact
on
lives
and
he
has
emerged
as
consistent
voice
of
reason
helping
his
colleagues
find
common
ground
on
some
of
the
most
controversial
and
contentious
issues
the
court
has
ever
faced
while
we
presume
to
replace
justice
wisdom
or
experience
have
selected
nominee
who
believe
embodies
that
same
excellence
independence
integrity
and
passion
for
the
law
and
who
can
ultimately
provide
that
same
kind
of
leadership
on
the
court
our
solicitor
general
and
my
friend
is
widely
regarded
as
one
of
the
foremost
legal
minds
an
acclaimed
legal
scholar
with
rich
understanding
of
constitutional
law
she
is
former
white
house
aide
with
lifelong
commitment
to
public
service
and
firm
grasp
of
the
and
boundaries
between
our
three
branches
of
government
she
is
leader
the
first
woman
to
serve
as
dean
of
harvard
law
school
and
one
of
the
most
successful
and
beloved
deans
in
its
history
and
she
is
superb
solicitor
general
our
chief
lawyer
representing
the
american
interests
before
the
supreme
court
the
first
woman
in
that
position
as
well
and
she
has
won
accolades
from
observers
across
the
ideological
spectrum
for
her
arguments
and
commanding
presence
but
is
respected
and
admired
not
just
for
her
intellect
and
record
of
achievement
but
also
for
her
temperament
her
openness
to
broad
array
of
viewpoints
her
habit
to
borrow
phrase
from
justice
understanding
before
her
and
skill
as
these
traits
were
particularly
evident
during
her
tenure
as
dean
at
time
when
many
believed
that
the
harvard
faculty
had
gotten
little
in
its
viewpoint
she
sought
to
recruit
prominent
conservative
scholars
and
spur
healthy
debate
on
campus
and
she
encouraged
students
from
all
backgrounds
to
respectfully
exchange
ideas
and
seek
common
ground
because
she
believes
as
do
that
exposure
to
broad
array
of
perspectives
is
the
foundation
not
just
for
sound
legal
education
but
of
successful
life
in
the
law
this
appreciation
for
diverse
views
may
also
come
in
handy
as
fan
serving
alongside
her
new
yankees
fan
justice
who
believe
has
ordered
pinstriped
robe
for
the
occasion
but
while
had
brilliant
career
in
academia
her
passion
for
the
law
is
anything
but
academic
she
has
often
referred
to
supreme
court
justice
for
whom
she
as
her
hero
understand
that
he
reciprocated
by
calling
her
nonetheless
she
credits
him
with
reminding
her
that
as
she
put
it
law
there
are
stories
stories
of
lives
as
shaped
by
the
law
stories
of
lives
as
might
be
changed
by
the
that
understanding
of
law
not
as
an
intellectual
exercise
or
words
on
page
but
as
it
affects
the
lives
of
ordinary
people
has
animated
every
step
of
career
including
her
service
as
solicitor
general
today
during
her
time
in
this
office
repeatedly
defended
the
rights
of
shareholders
and
ordinary
citizens
against
unscrupulous
corporations
last
year
in
the
citizens
united
case
she
defended
bipartisan
campaign
finance
reform
against
special
interests
seeking
to
spend
unlimited
money
to
influence
our
elections
despite
long
odds
of
success
with
most
legal
analysts
believing
the
government
was
unlikely
to
prevail
in
this
case
still
chose
it
as
her
very
first
case
to
argue
before
the
court
think
that
says
great
deal
not
just
about
tenacity
but
about
her
commitment
to
serving
the
american
people
think
it
says
great
deal
about
her
commitment
to
protect
our
fundamental
rights
because
in
democracy
powerful
interests
must
not
be
allowed
to
drown
out
the
voices
of
ordinary
citizens
and
think
it
says
great
deal
about
the
path
that
has
chosen
someone
as
gifted
as
could
easily
have
settled
into
comfortable
life
in
corporate
law
practice
instead
she
chose
life
of
service
service
to
her
students
service
to
her
country
service
to
the
law
and
to
all
those
whose
lives
it
shapes
and
given
upbringing
choice
that
probably
came
naturally
is
the
granddaughter
of
immigrants
whose
mother
was
for
years
beloved
public
schoolteacher
as
are
her
two
brothers
who
are
here
today
her
father
was
housing
lawyer
devoted
to
the
rights
of
tenants
both
were
the
first
in
their
families
to
attend
college
and
from
an
early
age
they
instilled
in
not
just
the
value
of
good
education
but
the
importance
of
using
it
to
serve
others
as
she
recalled
during
her
solicitor
general
confirmation
hearings
my
parents
wanted
me
to
succeed
in
my
chosen
profession
but
more
than
that
both
drilled
into
me
the
importance
of
service
character
and
has
also
spoken
movingly
about
how
her
mother
had
grown
up
at
time
when
women
had
few
opportunities
to
pursue
their
ambitions
and
took
great
joy
in
watching
her
daughter
do
so
neither
she
nor
father
lived
to
see
this
day
but
think
her
mother
would
relish
this
moment
think
she
would
relish
as
do
the
prospect
of
three
women
taking
their
seat
on
the
highest
court
for
the
first
time
in
history
court
that
would
be
more
inclusive
more
representative
more
reflective
of
us
as
people
than
ever
before
and
think
they
would
both
be
tremendously
proud
of
their
daughter
great
lawyer
great
teacher
and
devoted
public
servant
who
am
confident
will
make
an
outstanding
supreme
court
justice
so
hope
that
the
senate
will
act
in
bipartisan
fashion
as
they
did
in
confirming
to
be
our
solicitor
general
last
year
and
that
they
will
do
so
as
swiftly
as
possible
so
she
can
get
busy
and
take
her
seat
in
time
to
fully
participate
in
the
work
of
the
court
this
fall
with
that
would
like
to
invite
the
person
who
believe
will
be
the
next
supreme
court
justice
of
the
united
states
to
say
few
words
thank
you
so
much
and
to
all
the
other
board
members
to
guests
and
to
the
lovely
first
lady
good
evening

right
work

and
so
sure
that

actually
come

me
into
it
he
leaned

he
said

is
no
ordinary

big
beep

quite
year
since

of
downs
except
for
my
approval
ratings
which
have
just
gone
down
but
that
politics

bother
me
beside
happen
to
know
that
my
approval
ratings
are
still
very
high
in
the
country
of
my
birth
and
then
just
the
other
day
my
dear
friend
pulled
me
aside
and
she
gave
me
pep
talk
she
said
despite
the
numbers
she
said
do
worry
you
likeable
enough
which
made
me
feel
better
of
course
may
not
have
had
the
star
power
that
once
had
but
in
my
neither
do
all
of
you
people
say
to
me

helped
revive
the
banking
industry

saved
and
what
about
the
news

to
explain

fell
more
than
mine

year
is

the
way

of
the
jokes

brought
to

by
our
friends

you
do
have
to
worry
they
make
money
whether
you

number
of
notable
guests
in
attendance
here
tonight

most
pleased
that

me

to
these
things
and

few
things
in
life
that
are
harder
to
find
and
more
important
to
keep
than
love
well
love
and
birth
certificate
the
brothers
are
here
they
out
there
somewhere
and
are
huge
fans
but
boys
do
get
any
ideas
have
two
words
for
you
predator
drones
you
will
never
see
it
coming
you
think
joking
speaking
of
brown
is
here
admire
rare
politician
in
washington
with
nothing
to
hide
now
you
should
be
aware
that
brown
is
not
the
only
one
with
salacious
photo
spread
floating
around
recently
david
was
offered
opportunity
of
his
own
now
did
not
know
that
had
but
it
true
saw
backstage
when
we
were
taking
pictures
notorious
who
knows
what
truly
plagues
america
today
taxation
without
my
brother
did
similar
routine
last
year
but
it
always
works
odds
are
that
the
are
here
there
have
been
people
that
were
more
unwelcome
at
party
since
charlie
unfortunately
john
could
make
it
recently
he
claimed
that
he
had
never
identified
himself
as
maverick
and
we
all
know
what
happens
in
arizona
when
you
do
have
id
adios
look
feel
for
john
you
know
we
were
on
the
road
together
and
obviously
had
battle
and
you
learn
certainly
at
the
national
level
politics
easy
this
year
experienced
my
share
of
disappointments
for
example
had
my
heart
set
on
the
prize
for
physics
but
hey
you
win
all
speaking
of
undeserved
honors
few
weeks
ago
was
able
to
throw
out
the
first
pitch
at
the
nationals
game
and
do
know
if
you
saw
it
but
threw
it
little
high
and
little
outside
this
is
how
fox
news
covered
it
president
panders
to
extreme
of
batter
box
on
the
other
hand
had
different
take
president
pitches
and
then
went
different
way
altogether
video
shown
about
volcano
eruption
in
iceland
guess
that
why
they
the
most
trusted
name
in
news
now
look
have
reputation
for
giving
cable
hard
time
so
let
pick
on
for
while
you
know
people
attack
for
putting
new
focus
on
trivial
issues
political
fodder
gossip
sheet
that
not
fair
has
been
doing
this
for
centuries
now
just
check
out
these
headlines
our
researchers
found
these
japan
surrenders
where
the
bounce
then
there
this
one
lincoln
saves
union
but
can
he
save
house
majority
do
know
if
you
can
see
there
little
portion
there
he
lost
the
southern
white
vote
it
an
astute
analysis
there
and
my
july
senior
official
talks
break
down
independence
dead
so
this
is
nothing
new
but
even
though
the
mainstream
press
gives
me
hard
time
hear
that
still
pretty
big
on
twitter
or
as
calls
it
the
media
of
course
that
not
the
only
thing
that
we
been
accused
of
this
year
you
might
have
heard
we
passed
health
care
bill
and
is
that
applauding
out
there
some
republicans
have
suggested
that
the
bill
contains
few
secret
provisions
that
ridiculous
there
few
secret
provisions
in
the
health
care
plan
there
are
like
hundreds
tonight
in
the
interest
of
transparency
like
to
share
couple
let
see
this
provision
is
called
the
bay
state
of
denial
it
reads
this
bill
shall
cover
memory
loss
related
to
the
passage
of
health
care
reform
so
good
news
mitt
your
condition
is
covered
this
next
provision
is
called
the
jersey
it
reads
the
following
individuals
shall
be
excluded
from
the
indoor
tanning
tax
within
this
bill
the
situation
and
house
minority
leader
john
this
provision
ought
to
put
common
to
rest
it
says
right
here
if
you
do
not
like
the
ruling
of
your
death
panel
you
can
appeal
now
look
obviously
learned
this
year
politics
can
be
tough
business
but
there
are
times
where
you
just
help
but
laugh
you
know
what
really
tickles
me
apparently
claimed
that
came
up
to
him
one
day
in
the
house
locker
room
stark
naked
started
screaming
obscenities
at
him
to
which
say
welcome
to
my
world
feel
you
it
tense
moment
you
know
even
as
we
enjoy
each
other
company
tonight
we
also
mindful
of
the
incredible
struggles
of
our
fellow
americans
in
the
gulf
coast
both
those
leading
the
efforts
to
stem
this
crisis
and
those
along
the
coast
whose
livelihoods
are
in
jeopardy
as
result
of
the
spill
also
in
our
thoughts
and
prayers
tonight
are
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
put
their
lives
at
risk
each
and
every
day
for
our
safety
and
freedom
so
in
that
spirit
also
like
to
pay
tribute
to
the
journalists
who
play
an
extraordinary
role
in
telling
their
stories
earlier
today
gave
the
commencement
address
at
michigan
where
spoke
to
the
graduates
about
what
is
required
to
keep
out
democracy
thriving
in
the
century
and
one
of
the
points
made
is
that
for
all
the
changes
and
challenges
facing
your
industry
this
country
absolutely
needs
healthy
vibrant
media
needs
it
more
than
ever
now
today
technology
today
technology
has
made
it
possible
for
us
to
get
our
news
and
information
from
growing
range
of
sources
we
can
pick
and
choose
not
only
our
preferred
type
of
media
but
also
our
preferred
perspective
and
while
that
exposes
us
to
an
unprecedented
array
of
opinions
analysis
and
points
of
view
it
also
makes
it
that
much
more
important
that
we
all
operating
on
common
baseline
of
facts
it
makes
it
that
much
more
important
that
journalists
out
there
seek
only
the
truth
and
do
have
to
tell
you
that
some
of
you
are
seasoned
veterans
who
have
been
on
the
political
beat
for
decades
others
here
tonight
began
their
careers
as
not
long
ago
but
think
it
fair
to
say
that
every
single
reporter
in
this
room
believes
deeply
in
the
enterprise
of
journalism
every
one
of
you
even
the
most
cynical
among
you
understands
and
cherishes
the
function
of
free
press
and
the
preservation
of
our
system
of
government
and
of
our
way
of
life
and
want
you
to
know
that
for
all
the
jokes
and
the
occasional
gripes
cherish
that
work
as
well
in
fact
tonight
wanted
to
present
all
of
you
with
bipartisan
congressional
resolution
that
honors
all
those
wonderful
contributions
that
journalists
have
made
to
our
country
and
the
world
but
unfortunately
could
break
the
filibuster
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
it
is
great
to
be
here
in
the
big
house
and
so
may
say
blue
thought
go
for
the
cheap
applause
line
to
start
things
off
good
afternoon
president
the
board
of
trustees
to
faculty
parents
family
and
friends
of
the
class
of
congratulations
on
your
graduation
and
thank
you
for
allowing
me
the
of
being
part
of
it
let
me
acknowledge
your
wonderful
governor
your
mayor
john
and
all
the
members
of
congress
who
are
here
today
it
is
privilege
to
be
with
you
on
this
happy
occasion
and
you
know
nice
to
spend
little
time
outside
of
washington
now
get
me
wrong
washington
is
beautiful
city
very
nice
living
above
the
store
you
beat
the
commute
just
sometimes
all
you
hear
in
washington
is
the
of
politics
and
all
that
noise
can
drown
out
the
voices
of
the
people
who
sent
you
there
so
when
took
office
decided
that
each
night
would
read
letters
out
of
the
tens
of
thousands
that
are
sent
to
us
by
ordinary
americans
every
day
this
is
my
modest
effort
to
remind
myself
of
why
ran
in
the
first
place
some
of
these
letters
tell
stories
of
heartache
and
struggle
some
express
gratitude
some
express
anger
say
good
solid
third
call
me
an
idiot
which
is
how
know
that
getting
good
representative
sample
some
of
the
letters
make
you
think
like
the
one
that
received
last
month
from
kindergarten
class
in
virginia
now
the
teacher
of
this
class
instructed
the
students
to
ask
me
any
question
they
wanted
so
one
asked
do
you
do
your
job
another
asked
you
work
lot
somebody
wanted
to
know
if
wear
black
jacket
or
if
have
beard
so
clearly
they
were
getting
me
mixed
up
with
the
other
tall
guy
from
illinois
and
one
of
my
was
from
kid
who
wanted
to
know
if
lived
next
to
volcano
still
trying
to
piece
the
thought
process
on
this
one
loved
this
letter
but
it
was
the
last
question
from
the
last
student
in
the
letter
that
gave
me
pause
the
student
asked
people
being
nice
are
people
being
nice
well
if
you
turn
on
the
news
today
or
yesterday
or
week
ago
or
month
ago
particularly
one
of
the
cable
channels
you
can
see
why
even
would
ask
this
question
got
politicians
calling
each
other
all
sorts
of
unflattering
names
pundits
and
talking
heads
shout
at
each
other
the
media
tends
to
play
up
every
hint
of
conflict
because
it
makes
for
sexier
story
which
means
anyone
interested
in
getting
coverage
feels
compelled
to
make
their
arguments
as
outrageous
and
as
incendiary
as
possible
now
some
of
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
incredibly
difficult
moment
in
which
we
find
ourselves
as
nation
the
fact
is
when
you
leave
here
today
you
will
search
for
work
in
an
economy
that
is
still
emerging
from
the
worst
crisis
since
the
great
depression
you
live
in
century
where
the
speed
with
which
jobs
and
industries
move
across
the
globe
is
forcing
america
to
compete
like
never
before
you
will
raise
your
children
at
time
when
threats
like
terrorism
and
climate
change
confined
within
the
borders
of
any
one
country
and
as
our
world
grows
smaller
and
more
connected
you
will
live
and
work
with
more
people
who
look
like
you
or
think
like
you
or
come
from
where
you
do
really
enjoyed
remarks
because
that
lot
of
change
and
all
these
changes
all
these
challenges
inevitably
cause
some
tension
in
the
body
politic
they
make
people
worry
about
the
future
and
sometimes
they
get
people
riled
up
but
think
important
that
we
maintain
some
historic
perspective
since
the
days
of
our
founding
american
politics
has
never
been
particularly
nice
business
always
been
little
less
gentile
during
times
of
great
change
newspaper
of
the
opposing
party
once
that
if
thomas
were
elected
robbery
rape
adultery
and
incest
will
be
openly
taught
and
not
subtle
opponents
of
andrew
often
referred
to
his
mother
as
prostitute
which
seems
little
over
the
top
presidents
from
teddy
to
have
been
accused
of
promoting
socialism
or
worse
and
had
arguments
between
politicians
that
have
been
settled
with
actual
duels
there
was
even
caning
once
on
the
floor
of
the
united
states
senate
which
happy
to
say
happen
while
was
there
it
was
few
years
before
the
point
is
politics
has
never
been
for
the
or
the
and
if
you
enter
the
arena
you
should
expect
to
get
roughed
up
moreover
democracy
in
nation
of
more
than
million
people
is
inherently
difficult
always
been
noisy
and
messy
contentious
complicated
been
fighting
about
the
proper
size
and
role
of
government
since
the
day
the
framers
gathered
in
battled
over
the
meaning
of
individual
freedom
and
equality
since
the
bill
of
rights
was
drafted
as
our
economy
has
shifted
emphasis
from
agriculture
to
industry
to
information
to
technology
we
have
argued
and
struggled
at
each
and
every
juncture
over
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
all
of
our
citizens
have
shot
at
opportunity
so
before
we
get
too
depressed
about
the
current
state
of
our
politics
remember
our
history
the
great
debates
of
the
past
all
stirred
great
passions
they
all
made
somebody
angry
and
at
least
once
led
to
terrible
war
what
is
amazing
is
that
despite
all
the
conflict
despite
all
its
flaws
and
its
frustrations
our
experiment
in
democracy
has
worked
better
than
any
form
of
government
on
earth
on
the
last
day
of
the
constitutional
convention
benjamin
was
famously
asked
doctor
what
have
we
got
republic
or
monarchy
and
gave
an
answer
been
quoted
for
ages
he
said
republic
if
you
can
keep
if
you
can
keep
it
well
for
more
than
years
we
have
kept
it
through
revolution
and
civil
war
our
democracy
has
survived
through
depression
and
world
war
it
has
prevailed
through
periods
of
great
social
and
economic
unrest
from
civil
rights
to
rights
it
has
allowed
us
slowly
sometimes
painfully
to
move
towards
more
perfect
union
and
so
now
class
of
the
question
for
your
generation
is
this
how
will
you
keep
our
democracy
going
at
moment
when
our
challenges
seem
so
big
and
our
politics
seem
so
small
how
will
you
keep
our
democracy
alive
and
vibrant
how
will
you
keep
it
well
in
this
century
not
here
to
offer
some
grand
theory
or
detailed
policy
prescription
but
let
me
offer
few
brief
reflections
based
on
my
own
experiences
and
the
experiences
of
our
country
over
the
last
two
centuries
first
of
all
american
democracy
has
thrived
because
we
have
the
need
for
government
that
while
limited
can
still
help
us
adapt
to
changing
world
on
the
fourth
panel
of
the
memorial
is
quote
remember
reading
to
my
daughters
during
our
first
visit
there
it
says
am
not
an
advocate
for
frequent
changes
in
laws
and
constitutions
but
with
the
change
of
circumstances
institutions
must
advance
also
to
keep
pace
with
the
the
democracy
designed
by
and
the
other
founders
was
never
intended
to
solve
every
problem
with
new
law
or
new
program
having
thrown
off
the
tyranny
of
the
british
empire
the
first
americans
were
understandably
of
government
and
ever
since
held
fast
to
the
belief
that
government
have
all
the
answers
and
we
have
cherished
and
fiercely
defended
our
individual
freedom
strand
of
our
but
the
other
strand
is
the
belief
that
there
are
some
things
we
can
only
do
together
as
one
nation
and
that
our
government
must
keep
pace
with
the
times
when
america
expanded
from
few
colonies
to
an
entire
continent
and
we
needed
way
to
reach
the
pacific
our
government
helped
build
the
when
we
from
an
economy
based
on
farms
to
one
based
on
factories
and
workers
needed
new
skills
and
training
our
nation
set
up
system
of
public
high
schools
when
the
markets
crashed
during
the
depression
and
people
lost
their
life
savings
our
government
put
in
place
set
of
rules
and
safeguards
to
make
sure
that
such
crisis
never
happened
again
and
then
put
safety
net
in
place
to
make
sure
that
our
elders
would
never
be
impoverished
the
way
they
had
been
and
because
our
markets
and
financial
systems
have
evolved
since
then
now
putting
in
place
new
rules
and
safeguards
to
protect
the
american
people
now
this
notion
this
notion
class
always
been
partisan
it
was
the
first
republican
president
abraham
lincoln
who
said
the
role
of
government
is
to
do
for
the
people
what
they
can
not
do
better
for
themselves
and
go
on
to
begin
that
first
intercontinental
railroad
and
set
up
the
first
colleges
it
was
another
republican
teddy
who
said
object
of
government
is
the
welfare
of
the
and
remembered
for
using
the
power
of
government
to
break
up
monopolies
and
establish
our
national
park
system
democrat
announced
the
great
society
during
commencement
here
at
michigan
but
it
was
the
republican
president
before
him
who
launched
the
massive
government
undertaking
known
as
the
highway
system
of
course
there
have
always
been
those
opposed
such
efforts
they
argue
government
intervention
is
usually
inefficient
that
it
restricts
individual
freedom
and
dampens
individual
initiative
and
in
certain
instances
been
true
for
many
years
we
had
welfare
system
that
too
often
discouraged
people
from
taking
responsibility
for
their
own
upward
mobility
at
times
neglected
the
role
of
parents
rather
than
government
in
cultivating
education
and
sometimes
regulation
fails
and
sometimes
their
benefits
justify
their
costs
but
what
troubles
me
is
when
hear
people
say
that
all
of
government
is
inherently
bad
one
of
my
signs
during
the
health
care
debate
was
somebody
who
said
your
government
hands
out
of
my
which
is
essentially
saying
government
out
of
my
health
care
when
our
government
is
spoken
of
as
some
menacing
threatening
foreign
entity
it
ignores
the
fact
that
in
our
democracy
government
is
us
we
the
people
we
the
people
hold
in
our
hands
the
power
to
choose
our
leaders
and
change
our
laws
and
shape
our
own
destiny
government
is
the
police
officers
who
are
protecting
our
communities
and
the
servicemen
and
women
who
are
defending
us
abroad
government
is
the
roads
you
drove
in
on
and
the
speed
limits
that
kept
you
safe
government
is
what
ensures
that
mines
adhere
to
safety
standards
and
that
oil
spills
are
cleaned
up
by
the
companies
that
caused
them
government
is
this
extraordinary
public
university
place
doing
lifesaving
research
and
economic
growth
and
graduating
students
who
will
change
the
world
around
them
in
ways
big
and
small
the
truth
is
the
debate
had
for
decades
now
between
more
government
and
less
government
it
really
fit
the
times
in
which
we
live
we
know
that
too
much
government
can
stifle
competition
and
deprive
us
of
choice
and
burden
us
with
debt
but
also
clearly
seen
the
dangers
of
too
little
government
like
when
lack
of
accountability
on
wall
street
nearly
leads
to
the
collapse
of
our
entire
economy
so
class
of
what
we
should
be
asking
is
not
whether
we
need
or
government
but
how
we
can
create
smarter
and
better
government
because
in
an
era
of
and
where
we
have
more
choices
than
ever
before
even
though
really
work
lot
of
these
things
but
have
who
do
it
for
me
government
try
to
dictate
your
lives
but
it
should
give
you
the
tools
you
need
to
succeed
government
try
to
guarantee
results
but
it
should
guarantee
shot
at
opportunity
for
every
american
willing
to
work
hard
so
so
yes
we
can
and
should
debate
the
role
of
government
in
our
lives
but
remember
as
you
are
asked
to
meet
the
challenges
of
our
time
remember
that
the
ability
for
us
to
adapt
our
government
to
the
needs
of
the
age
has
helped
make
our
democracy
work
since
its
inception
now
the
second
way
to
keep
our
democracy
healthy
is
to
maintain
basic
level
of
civility
in
our
public
debate
these
arguments
having
over
government
and
health
care
and
war
and
taxes
these
are
serious
arguments
they
should
arouse
passions
and
important
for
everybody
to
join
in
the
debate
with
all
the
that
the
maintenance
of
free
people
requires
but
we
expect
to
solve
our
problems
if
all
we
do
is
tear
each
other
down
you
can
disagree
with
certain
policy
without
the
person
who
espouses
it
you
can
question
views
and
their
judgment
without
questioning
their
motives
or
their
patriotism
throwing
around
phrases
like
and
and
and
that
may
grab
headlines
but
it
also
has
the
effect
of
comparing
our
government
our
political
opponents
to
authoritarian
even
murderous
regimes
now
seen
this
kind
of
politics
in
the
past
been
by
both
fringes
of
the
ideological
spectrum
by
the
left
and
the
right
since
our
birth
but
starting
to
creep
into
the
of
our
discourse
and
the
problem
with
it
is
not
the
hurt
feelings
or
the
bruised
of
the
public
officials
who
are
remember
they
signed
up
for
it
always
reminds
me
of
that
the
problem
is
that
this
kind
of
vilification
and
rhetoric
closes
the
door
to
the
possibility
of
compromise
it
undermines
democratic
deliberation
it
prevents
learning
since
after
all
why
should
we
listen
to
or
or
nut
or
it
makes
it
nearly
impossible
for
people
who
have
legitimate
but
differences
to
sit
down
at
the
same
table
and
hash
things
out
it
robs
us
of
rational
and
serious
debate
the
one
we
need
to
have
about
the
very
real
and
very
big
challenges
facing
this
nation
it
coarsens
our
culture
and
at
its
worst
it
can
send
signals
to
the
most
extreme
elements
of
our
society
that
perhaps
violence
is
justifiable
response
so
what
do
we
do
as
found
out
after
year
in
the
white
house
changing
this
type
of
politics
is
not
easy
and
part
of
what
civility
requires
is
that
we
recall
the
simple
lesson
most
of
us
learned
from
our
parents
treat
others
as
you
would
like
to
be
treated
with
courtesy
and
respect
but
civility
in
this
age
also
requires
something
more
than
just
asking
if
we
just
all
get
along
amplifies
the
most
inflammatory
louder
and
faster
than
ever
before
and
also
however
given
us
unprecedented
choice
whereas
most
americans
used
to
get
their
news
from
the
same
three
networks
over
dinner
or
few
influential
papers
on
sunday
morning
we
now
have
the
option
to
get
our
information
from
any
number
of
or
or
cable
news
shows
and
this
can
have
both
good
and
bad
development
for
democracy
for
if
we
choose
only
to
expose
ourselves
to
opinions
and
viewpoints
that
are
in
line
with
our
own
studies
suggest
that
we
become
more
more
set
in
our
ways
that
will
only
reinforce
and
even
deepen
the
political
divides
in
this
country
but
if
we
choose
to
actively
seek
out
information
that
challenges
our
assumptions
and
our
beliefs
perhaps
we
can
begin
to
understand
where
the
people
who
disagree
with
us
are
coming
from
now
this
requires
us
to
agree
on
certain
set
of
facts
to
debate
from
why
we
need
vibrant
and
thriving
news
business
that
is
separate
from
opinion
makers
and
talking
heads
why
we
need
an
educated
citizenry
that
values
hard
evidence
and
not
just
assertion
as
senator
daniel
famously
once
said
is
entitled
to
his
own
opinion
but
not
his
own
still
if
somebody
who
only
reads
the
editorial
page
of
the
new
york
times
try
glancing
at
the
opinion
page
of
the
wall
street
journal
once
in
while
if
fan
of
glenn
beck
or
rush
try
reading
few
columns
on
the
post
website
it
may
make
your
blood
boil
your
mind
may
not
be
changed
but
the
practice
of
listening
to
opposing
views
is
essential
for
effective
citizenship
it
is
essential
for
our
democracy
and
so
too
is
the
practice
of
engaging
in
different
experiences
with
different
kinds
of
people
look
out
at
this
class
and
for
four
years
at
michigan
you
have
been
exposed
to
diverse
thinkers
and
scholars
professors
and
students
narrow
that
broad
intellectual
exposure
just
because
leaving
here
instead
seek
to
expand
it
if
you
grew
up
in
big
city
spend
some
time
with
somebody
who
grew
up
in
rural
town
if
you
find
yourself
only
hanging
around
with
people
of
your
own
race
or
ethnicity
or
religion
include
people
in
your
circle
who
have
different
backgrounds
and
life
experiences
learn
what
like
to
walk
in
somebody
shoes
and
in
the
process
you
will
help
to
make
this
democracy
work
which
brings
me
to
the
last
ingredient
in
functioning
democracy
one
that
perhaps
most
basic
and
already
been
mentioned
and
that
is
participation
class
of
understand
that
one
effect
of
poisonous
political
climate
is
to
push
people
away
from
participation
in
public
life
if
all
you
see
when
you
turn
on
the
is
if
all
you
hear
about
is
how
special
interest
lobbying
and
partisanship
prevented
washington
from
getting
something
done
you
might
think
to
yourself
the
point
of
getting
involved
the
point
when
we
pay
close
attention
to
the
decisions
made
by
our
leaders
when
we
fail
to
educate
ourselves
about
the
major
issues
of
the
day
when
we
choose
not
to
make
our
voices
and
opinions
heard
when
democracy
breaks
down
when
power
is
abused
when
the
most
extreme
voices
in
our
society
fill
the
void
that
we
leave
when
powerful
interests
and
their
lobbyists
are
most
able
to
buy
access
and
influence
in
the
corridors
of
power
because
none
of
us
are
there
to
speak
up
and
stop
them
participation
in
public
life
mean
that
you
all
have
to
run
for
public
office
though
we
could
certainly
use
some
fresh
faces
in
washington
but
it
does
mean
that
you
should
pay
attention
and
contribute
in
any
way
that
you
can
stay
informed
write
letters
or
make
phone
calls
on
behalf
of
an
issue
you
care
about
if
electoral
politics
your
thing
continue
the
tradition
so
many
of
you
started
here
at
michigan
and
find
way
to
serve
your
community
and
your
country
an
act
that
will
help
you
stay
connected
to
your
fellow
citizens
and
improve
the
lives
of
those
around
you
it
was
years
ago
that
young
candidate
for
president
came
here
to
michigan
and
delivered
that
inspired
one
of
the
most
successful
service
projects
in
american
history
and
as
john
kennedy
described
the
ideals
behind
what
would
become
the
peace
corps
he
issued
challenge
to
the
students
who
had
assembled
in
arbor
on
that
october
night
your
willingness
to
contribute
part
of
your
life
to
this
country
he
said
will
depend
the
answer
whether
free
society
can
compete
think
it
can
he
said
this
democracy
we
have
is
precious
thing
for
all
the
arguments
and
all
the
doubts
and
all
the
cynicism
out
there
today
we
should
never
forget
that
as
americans
we
enjoy
more
freedoms
and
opportunities
than
citizens
in
any
other
nation
on
earth
we
are
free
to
speak
our
mind
and
worship
as
we
please
we
are
free
to
choose
our
leaders
and
them
if
they
let
us
down
we
have
the
chance
to
get
an
education
and
work
hard
and
give
our
children
better
life
none
of
this
came
easy
none
of
this
was
preordained
the
men
and
women
who
sat
in
your
chairs
years
ago
and
years
ago
and
years
ago
they
made
america
possible
through
their
toil
and
their
endurance
and
their
imagination
and
their
faith
their
success
and
success
was
never
given
and
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
graduates
who
will
sit
in
these
same
seats
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
will
enjoy
the
same
freedoms
and
opportunities
that
you
do
you
too
will
have
to
strive
you
too
will
have
to
push
the
boundaries
of
what
seems
possible
for
the
truth
is
our
destiny
has
never
been
certain
what
is
certain
what
has
always
been
certain
is
the
ability
to
shape
that
destiny
that
is
what
makes
us
different
that
is
what
sets
us
apart
that
is
what
makes
us
americans
our
ability
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
look
past
all
of
our
differences
and
all
of
our
disagreements
and
still
forge
common
future
that
task
is
now
in
your
hands
as
is
the
answer
to
the
question
posed
at
this
university
half
century
ago
about
whether
free
society
can
still
compete
if
you
are
willing
as
past
generations
were
willing
to
contribute
part
of
your
life
to
the
life
of
this
country
then
like
president
kennedy
believe
we
can
because
believe
in
you
congratulations
on
your
graduation
may
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
please
be
seated
let
me
begin
by
saying
word
to
sister
to
some
she
was
mentor
to
all
she
was
friend
but
to
you
she
was
family
and
my
family
offers
yours
our
sympathy
for
your
loss
we
are
gathered
here
today
to
celebrate
the
life
and
mourn
the
passing
of
height
it
is
fitting
that
we
do
so
here
in
our
national
cathedral
of
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
here
in
place
of
great
here
in
the
house
of
god
surrounded
by
the
love
of
family
and
of
friends
the
love
in
this
sanctuary
is
testament
to
life
lived
righteously
life
that
lifted
other
lives
life
that
changed
this
country
for
the
better
over
the
course
of
nearly
one
century
here
on
earth
and
know
dr
height
as
well
or
as
long
as
many
of
you
we
were
reminded
during
previous
moment
in
the
service
when
you
have
nephew
lived
full
life
but
we
did
come
to
know
her
in
the
early
days
of
my
campaign
and
we
came
to
love
her
as
so
many
loved
her
we
came
to
love
her
stories
and
we
loved
her
smile
and
we
loved
those
hats
that
she
wore
like
crown
regal
in
the
white
house
she
was
regular
she
came
by
not
once
not
twice
times
she
stopped
by
the
white
house
took
part
in
our
discussions
around
health
care
reform
in
her
final
months
last
february
was
scheduled
to
see
her
and
other
civil
rights
leaders
to
discuss
the
pressing
problems
of
unemployment
reverend
ben
jealous
of
the
of
the
national
urban
league
then
we
discovered
that
washington
was
about
to
be
blanketed
by
the
worst
blizzard
in
record
two
feet
of
snow
so
suggested
to
one
of
my
aides
we
should
call
dr
height
and
say
we
happy
to
reschedule
the
meeting
certainly
if
the
others
come
she
should
not
feel
obliged
true
to
form
dr
height
insisted
on
coming
despite
the
blizzard
never
mind
that
she
was
in
wheelchair
she
was
not
about
to
let
just
bunch
of
men
in
this
meeting
it
was
only
when
the
car
literally
could
not
get
to
her
driveway
that
she
reluctantly
decided
to
stay
home
but
she
still
sent
message
about
what
needed
to
be
done
and
tell
that
story
partly
because
it
brings
smile
to
my
face
but
also
because
it
captures
the
quiet
dogged
dignified
persistence
that
all
of
us
who
loved
dr
height
came
to
know
so
well
an
attribute
that
we
understand
she
learned
early
on
born
in
the
capital
of
the
old
confederacy
brought
north
by
her
parents
as
part
of
that
great
migration
dr
height
was
raised
in
another
age
in
different
america
beyond
the
experience
of
many
hard
to
imagine
think
life
in
the
first
decades
of
that
last
century
when
the
elderly
woman
that
we
knew
was
only
girl
crow
ruled
the
south
the
was
on
the
rise
powerful
political
force
lynching
was
all
too
often
the
penalty
for
the
of
black
skin
slaves
had
been
freed
within
living
memory
but
too
often
their
children
their
grandchildren
remained
captive
because
they
were
denied
justice
and
denied
equality
denied
opportunity
denied
chance
to
pursue
their
dreams
the
progress
that
followed
progress
that
so
many
of
you
helped
to
achieve
progress
that
ultimately
made
it
possible
for
and
me
to
be
here
as
president
and
first
lady
that
progress
came
slowly
progress
came
from
the
collective
effort
of
multiple
generations
of
americans
from
preachers
and
lawyers
and
thinkers
and
doers
men
and
women
like
dr
height
who
took
it
upon
themselves
often
at
great
risk
to
change
this
country
for
the
better
from
men
like
and
women
like
mary
and
americans
whose
names
we
know
they
are
leaders
whose
legacies
we
teach
they
are
giants
who
fill
our
history
books
well
height
deserves
place
in
this
pantheon
she
too
deserves
place
in
our
history
books
she
too
deserves
place
of
in
memory
look
at
her
body
of
work
the
laying
the
groundwork
for
integration
on
in
lending
pigs
to
poor
farmers
as
sustainable
source
of
income
with
civil
rights
leaders
holding
her
own
the
only
woman
in
the
room
queen
to
this
moses
generation
even
as
she
led
the
national
council
of
women
with
vision
and
energy
with
vision
and
energy
vision
and
class
but
we
remember
her
not
solely
for
all
she
did
during
the
civil
rights
movement
we
remember
her
for
all
she
did
over
lifetime
behind
the
scenes
to
broaden
the
reach
to
shine
light
on
stable
families
and
communities
to
make
us
see
the
drive
for
civil
rights
and
rights
not
as
separate
struggle
but
as
part
of
larger
movement
to
secure
the
rights
of
all
humanity
regardless
of
gender
regardless
of
race
regardless
of
ethnicity
an
unambiguous
record
of
righteous
work
worthy
of
remembrance
worthy
of
recognition
and
yet
one
of
the
ironies
is
is
that
year
after
year
decade
in
decade
out
dr
height
went
about
her
work
quietly
without
fanfare
without
she
never
cared
about
who
got
the
credit
she
need
to
see
her
picture
in
the
papers
she
understood
that
the
movement
gathered
strength
from
the
bottom
up
those
unheralded
men
and
women
who
do
always
make
it
into
the
history
books
but
who
steadily
insisted
on
their
dignity
on
their
manhood
and
womanhood
she
interested
in
credit
what
she
cared
about
was
the
cause
the
cause
of
justice
the
cause
of
equality
the
cause
of
opportunity
cause
and
that
willingness
to
subsume
herself
that
humility
and
that
grace
is
why
we
height
as
it
is
written
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
whoever
exalts
himself
will
be
humbled
and
whoever
humbles
himself
will
be
think
the
author
of
the
gospel
would
mind
me
rephrasing
humbles
herself
will
be
one
of
my
moments
with
dr
height
this
was
just
few
months
ago
we
had
decided
to
put
up
the
emancipation
proclamation
in
the
oval
office
and
we
invited
some
elders
to
share
reflections
of
the
movement
and
she
came
and
it
was
event
so
we
had
young
children
there
as
well
as
elders
and
the
elders
were
asked
to
share
stories
and
she
talked
about
attending
dinner
in
the
at
the
home
of
benjamin
then
president
of
college
and
seated
at
the
table
that
evening
was
student
gifted
child
as
she
described
him
filled
with
sense
of
purpose
who
was
trying
to
decide
whether
to
enter
medicine
or
law
or
the
ministry
and
many
years
later
after
that
gifted
child
had
become
gifted
preacher
sure
he
had
been
told
to
be
on
his
best
after
he
led
bus
boycott
in
and
inspired
nation
with
his
dreams
he
delivered
sermon
on
what
he
called
drum
major
sermon
that
said
we
all
have
the
desire
to
be
first
we
all
want
to
be
at
the
front
of
the
line
the
great
test
of
life
martin
luther
king
said
is
to
harness
that
instinct
to
redirect
it
towards
advancing
the
greater
good
toward
changing
community
and
country
for
the
better
toward
doing
the
work
sometimes
think
king
must
have
had
height
in
mind
when
he
gave
that
for
height
met
the
test
height
embodied
that
instinct
height
was
drum
major
for
justice
drum
major
for
equality
drum
major
for
freedom
drum
major
for
service
and
the
lesson
she
would
want
us
to
leave
with
today
lesson
she
lived
out
each
and
every
day
is
that
we
can
all
be
first
in
service
we
can
all
be
drum
majors
for
righteous
cause
so
let
us
live
out
that
lesson
let
us
her
life
by
changing
this
country
for
the
better
as
long
as
we
are
blessed
to
live
may
god
bless
height
and
the
union
that
she
made
more
perfect
thank
you
please
be
seated
to
all
the
families
who
loved
so
deeply
the
miners
lost
to
all
who
called
them
friends
worked
alongside
them
in
the
mines
or
knew
them
as
in
and
or
in
the
coal
river
valley
and
across
west
virginia
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
we
have
been
mourning
with
you
throughout
these
difficult
days
our
hearts
have
been
aching
with
you
we
keep
our
thoughts
with
the
survivors
who
are
recovering
and
resting
at
the
hospital
and
at
the
homes
we
thankful
for
the
rescue
teams
but
our
hearts
ache
alongside
you
here
to
americans
bell

james
adam
joshua
earl
price
dale
and
workman
nothing
or
the
vice
president
or
the
governor
none
of
the
speakers
here
today
nothing
we
say
can
fill
the
hole
they
leave
in
your
hearts
or
the
absence
that
they
leave
in
your
lives
if
any
comfort
can
be
found
it
can
perhaps
be
found
by
seeking
the
face
of
god
who
quiets
our
troubled
minds
god
who
mends
our
broken
hearts
god
who
eases
our
mourning
souls
even
as
we
mourn
lives
lost
we
also
remember
lives
lived
up
at
in
the
morning
at
the
latest
they
began
their
day
as
they
worked
in
darkness
in
coveralls
and
boots
over
their
heads
they
would
sit
quietly
for
their
journey
five
miles
into
mountain
the
only
light
the
lamp
on
their
caps
or
the
glow
from
the
they
rode
in
day
after
day
they
would
burrow
into
the
coal
the
fruits
of
their
what
so
often
we
take
for
granted
the
electricity
that
lights
up
convention
that
lights
up
our
church
or
our
home
our
school
our
office
the
energy
that
powers
our
country
the
energy
that
powers
the
world
and
most
days
emerge
from
the
dark
mine
squinting
at
the
light
most
days
emerge
sweaty
and
dirty
and
dusted
from
coal
most
days
come
home
but
not
that
day
these
men
these
husbands
fathers
grandfathers
brothers
sons
uncles
nephews
they
did
not
take
on
their
job
unaware
of
the
perils
some
of
them
had
already
been
injured
some
of
them
had
seen
friend
get
hurt
so
they
understood
there
were
risks
and
their
families
did
too
they
knew
their
kids
would
say
prayer
at
night
before
they
left
they
knew
their
wives
would
wait
for
call
when
their
shift
ended
saying
everything
was
okay
they
knew
their
parents
felt
pang
of
fear
every
time
breaking
news
alert
came
on
or
the
radio
cut
in
but
they
left
for
the
mines
anyway
some
having
waited
all
their
lives
to
be
miners
having
longed
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
their
fathers
and
their
grandfathers
and
yet
none
of
them
did
it
for
themselves
alone
all
that
hard
work
all
that
hardship
all
the
time
spent
underground
it
was
all
for
the
families
it
was
all
for
you
for
car
in
the
driveway
roof
overhead
for
chance
to
give
their
kids
opportunities
that
they
would
never
know
and
enjoy
retirement
with
their
spouses
it
was
all
in
the
hopes
of
something
better
and
so
these
miners
lived
as
they
died
in
pursuit
of
the
american
dream
there
in
the
mines
for
their
families
they
became
family
themselves
sharing
birthdays
relaxing
together
watching
mountaineers
football
or
basketball
together
spending
days
off
together
hunting
or
fishing
they
may
not
have
always
loved
what
they
did
said
sister
but
they
loved
doing
it
together
they
loved
doing
it
as
family
they
loved
doing
it
as
community
spirit
reflected
in
song
that
almost
every
american
knows
but
song
most
people
think
would
be
surprised
was
actually
written
by
coal
son
about
this
town
about
the
people
of
west
virginia
the
song
lean
on
me
an
anthem
of
friendship
but
also
an
anthem
of
community
of
coming
together
that
community
was
revealed
for
all
to
see
in
the
minutes
and
hours
and
days
after
the
tragedy
rescuers
risking
their
own
safety
scouring
narrow
tunnels
saturated
with
methane
and
carbon
monoxide
hoping
against
hope
they
might
find
survivor
friends
keeping
porch
lights
on
in
nightly
vigil
hanging
up
homemade
signs
that
read
pray
for
our
miners
and
their
families
consoling
each
other
and
supporting
each
other
and
leaning
on
one
another
seen
it
the
strength
of
that
community
in
the
days
that
followed
the
disaster
and
letters
poured
into
the
white
house
postmarked
from
different
places
across
the
country
they
often
began
the
same
way
am
proud
to
be
from
family
of
miners
am
the
son
of
coal
miner
am
proud
to
be
coal
daughter
they
were
always
proud
and
they
asked
me
to
keep
our
miners
in
my
thoughts
in
my
prayers
never
forget
they
say
miners
keep
lights
on
and
then
in
these
letters
they
make
simple
plea
let
this
happen
again
do
let
this
happen
again
how
can
we
fail
them
how
can
nation
that
relies
on
its
miners
not
do
everything
in
its
power
to
protect
them
how
can
we
let
anyone
in
this
country
put
their
lives
at
risk
by
simply
showing
up
to
work
by
simply
pursuing
the
american
dream
we
can
not
bring
back
the
men
we
lost
they
are
with
the
lord
now
our
task
here
on
earth
is
to
save
lives
from
being
lost
in
another
such
tragedy
to
do
what
must
do
individually
and
collectively
to
assure
safe
conditions
underground
to
treat
our
miners
like
they
treat
each
other
like
family
because
we
are
all
family
and
we
are
all
americans
and
we
have
to
lean
on
one
another
and
look
out
for
one
another
and
love
one
another
and
pray
for
one
another
there
psalm
that
comes
to
mind
today
psalm
that
comes
to
mind
psalm
we
often
turn
to
in
times
of
heartache
even
though
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
will
fear
no
evil
for
you
are
with
me
your
rod
and
your
staff
they
comfort
me
god
bless
our
miners

bless
their
families

god
bless
the

thank
you
very

everybody
please
have

thank
you
very
much
well
thank
you
it
is
good
to
be
back
it
is
good
to
be
back
in
new
york
it
is
good
to
be
back
in
the
great
hall
at
cooper
union
got
some
special
guests
here
that
want
to
acknowledge
is

thank
you
very
much
for
your
attendance
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
in
cooper
union
where
generations
of
leaders
and
citizens
have
come
to
defend
their
ideas
and
contest
their
differences
also
good
to
be
back
in
lower
few
blocks
from
wall
street
it
really
is
good
to
be
back
because
wall
street
is
the
heart
of
our
financial
sector
now
since
last
spoke
here
two
years
ago
our
country
has
been
through
terrible
trial
more
than
million
people
have
lost
their
jobs
countless
small
businesses
have
had
to
shut
their
doors
trillions
of
dollars
in
savings
have
been
lost
forcing
seniors
to
put
off
retirement
young
people
to
postpone
college
entrepreneurs
to
give
up
on
the
dream
of
starting
company
and
as
nation
we
were
forced
to
take
unprecedented
steps
to
rescue
the
financial
system
and
the
broader
economy
and
as
result
of
the
decisions
we
made
some
of
which
face
it
were
very
unpopular
we
are
seeing
hopeful
signs
little
more
than
one
year
ago
we
were
losing
an
average
of
jobs
each
month
today
america
is
adding
jobs
again
one
year
ago
the
economy
was
shrinking
rapidly
today
the
economy
is
growing
in
fact
seen
the
fastest
turnaround
in
growth
in
nearly
three
decades
but
here
and
here
because
got
more
work
to
do
until
this
progress
is
felt
not
just
on
wall
street
but
on
main
street
we
can
not
be
satisfied
until
the
millions
of
our
who
are
looking
for
work
can
find
job
and
wages
are
growing
at
meaningful
pace
we
may
be
able
to
claim
technical
recovery
but
we
will
not
have
truly
recovered
and
even
as
we
seek
to
revive
this
economy
also
incumbent
on
us
to
rebuild
it
stronger
than
before
we
want
an
economy
that
has
the
same
weaknesses
that
led
to
this
crisis
and
that
means
addressing
some
of
the
underlying
problems
that
led
to
this
turmoil
and
devastation
in
the
first
place
now
one
of
the
most
significant
contributors
to
this
recession
was
financial
crisis
as
dire
as
any
known
in
generations
at
least
since
the
and
that
crisis
was
born
of
failure
of
responsibility
from
wall
street
all
the
way
to
washington
that
brought
down
many
of
the
largest
financial
firms
and
nearly
dragged
our
economy
into
second
great
depression
it
was
that
failure
of
responsibility
that
spoke
about
when
came
to
new
york
more
than
two
years
ago
before
the
worst
of
the
crisis
had
unfolded
it
was
back
in
and
take
no
satisfaction
in
noting
that
my
comments
then
have
largely
been
borne
out
by
the
events
that
followed
but
repeat
what
said
then
because
it
is
essential
that
we
learn
the
lessons
from
this
crisis
so
we
doom
ourselves
to
repeat
it
and
make
no
mistake
that
is
exactly
what
will
happen
if
we
allow
this
moment
to
pass
and
an
outcome
that
is
unacceptable
to
me
and
unacceptable
to
you
the
american
people
as
said
on
this
stage
two
years
ago
believe
in
the
power
of
the
free
market
believe
in
strong
financial
sector
that
helps
people
to
raise
capital
and
get
loans
and
invest
their
savings
part
of
what
has
made
america
what
it
is
but
free
market
was
never
meant
to
be
free
license
to
take
whatever
you
can
get
however
you
can
get
it
what
happened
too
often
in
the
years
leading
up
to
this
crisis
some
and
let
me
be
clear
not
all
but
some
on
wall
street
forgot
that
behind
every
dollar
traded
or
leveraged
family
looking
to
buy
house
or
pay
for
an
education
open
business
save
for
retirement
what
happens
on
wall
street
has
real
consequences
across
the
country
across
our
economy
spoken
before
about
the
need
to
build
new
foundation
for
economic
growth
in
the
century
and
given
the
importance
of
the
financial
sector
wall
street
reform
is
an
absolutely
essential
part
of
that
foundation
without
it
our
house
will
continue
to
sit
on
shifting
sands
and
our
families
businesses
and
the
global
economy
will
be
vulnerable
to
future
crises
why
feel
so
strongly
that
we
need
to
enact
set
of
updated
commonsense
rules
to
ensure
accountability
on
wall
street
and
to
protect
consumers
in
our
financial
system
now
the
good
news
comprehensive
plan
to
achieve
these
reforms
has
already
passed
the
house
of
representatives
senate
version
is
currently
being
debated
drawing
on
ideas
from
democrats
and
republicans
both
bills
represent
significant
improvement
on
the
flawed
rules
that
we
have
in
place
today
despite
the
furious
effort
of
industry
lobbyists
to
shape
this
legislation
to
their
special
interests
and
for
those
of
you
in
the
financial
sector
sure
that
some
of
these
lobbyists
work
for
you
and
doing
what
they
are
being
paid
to
do
but
here
today
specifically
when
speak
to
the
titans
of
industry
here
because
want
to
urge
you
to
join
us
instead
of
fighting
us
in
this
effort
here
because
believe
that
these
reforms
are
in
the
end
not
only
in
the
best
interest
of
our
country
but
in
the
best
interest
of
the
financial
sector
and
here
to
explain
what
reform
will
look
like
and
why
it
matters
now
first
the
bill
being
considered
in
the
senate
would
create
what
we
did
not
have
before
and
that
is
way
to
protect
the
financial
system
and
the
broader
economy
and
american
taxpayers
in
the
event
that
large
financial
firm
begins
to
fail
if
or
an
how
can
we
respond
in
way
that
force
taxpayers
to
pick
up
the
tab
or
alternatively
could
bring
down
the
whole
system
in
an
ordinary
local
bank
when
it
approaches
insolvency
got
process
an
orderly
process
through
the
that
ensures
that
depositors
are
protected
maintains
confidence
in
the
banking
system
and
it
works
customers
and
taxpayers
are
protected
and
owners
and
management
lose
their
equity
but
we
have
that
kind
of
process
designed
to
contain
the
failure
of
brothers
or
any
of
the
largest
and
most
interconnected
financial
firms
in
our
country
why
when
this
crisis
began
crucial
decisions
about
what
would
happen
to
some
of
the
biggest
companies
companies
employing
tens
of
thousands
of
people
and
holding
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
assets
had
to
take
place
in
hurried
discussions
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
why
to
save
the
entire
economy
from
an
even
worse
catastrophe
we
had
to
deploy
taxpayer
dollars
now
much
of
that
money
has
now
been
paid
back
and
my
administration
has
proposed
fee
to
be
paid
by
large
financial
firms
to
recover
all
the
money
every
dime
because
the
american
people
should
never
have
been
put
in
that
position
in
the
first
place
but
this
is
why
we
need
system
to
shut
these
firms
down
with
the
least
amount
of
collateral
damage
to
innocent
people
and
innocent
businesses
and
from
the
start
insisted
that
the
financial
industry
not
taxpayers
shoulder
the
costs
in
the
event
that
large
financial
company
should
falter
the
goal
is
to
make
certain
that
taxpayers
are
never
again
on
the
hook
because
firm
is
deemed
big
to
now
legitimate
debate
taking
place
about
how
best
to
ensure
taxpayers
are
held
harmless
in
this
process
and
legitimate
debate
and
encourage
that
debate
but
not
legitimate
is
to
suggest
that
somehow
the
legislation
being
proposed
is
going
to
encourage
future
taxpayer
as
some
have
claimed
that
makes
for
good
sound
bite
but
not
factually
accurate
it
is
not
true
in
fact
the
system
as
it
stands
the
system
as
it
stands
is
what
led
to
series
of
massive
costly
taxpayer
and
only
with
reform
that
we
can
avoid
similar
outcome
in
the
future
in
other
words
vote
for
reform
is
vote
to
put
stop
to
the
truth
end
of
story
and
nobody
should
be
fooled
in
this
debate
by
the
way
these
changes
have
the
added
benefit
of
creating
incentives
within
the
industry
to
ensure
that
no
one
company
can
ever
threaten
to
bring
down
the
whole
economy
to
that
end
the
bill
would
also
enact
known
as
the
rule
and
tall
guy
sitting
in
the
front
row
here
paul
who
we
named
it
after
and
it
does
something
very
simple
it
places
some
limits
on
the
size
of
banks
and
the
kinds
of
risks
that
banking
institutions
can
take
this
will
not
only
safeguard
our
system
against
crises
this
will
also
make
our
system
stronger
and
more
competitive
by
instilling
confidence
here
at
home
and
across
the
globe
markets
depend
on
that
confidence
part
of
what
led
to
the
turmoil
of
the
past
two
years
was
that
in
the
absence
of
clear
rules
and
sound
practices
people
trust
that
our
system
was
one
in
which
it
was
safe
to
invest
or
lend
as
seen
that
harms
all
of
us
so
by
enacting
these
reforms
help
ensure
that
our
financial
system
and
our
economy
continues
to
be
the
envy
of
the
world
the
first
thing
making
sure
that
we
can
wind
down
one
firm
if
it
gets
into
trouble
without
bringing
the
whole
system
down
or
forcing
taxpayers
to
fund
bailout
number
two
reform
would
bring
new
transparency
to
many
financial
markets
as
you
know
part
of
what
led
to
this
crisis
was
firms
like
and
others
who
were
making
huge
and
risky
bets
using
derivatives
and
other
complicated
financial
instruments
in
ways
that
defied
accountability
or
even
common
sense
in
fact
many
practices
were
so
opaque
so
confusing
so
complex
that
the
people
inside
the
firms
understand
them
much
less
those
who
were
charged
with
overseeing
them
they
fully
aware
of
the
massive
bets
that
were
being
placed
what
led
warren
to
describe
derivatives
that
were
bought
and
sold
with
little
oversight
as
weapons
of
mass
what
he
called
them
and
why
reform
will
rein
in
excess
and
help
ensure
that
these
kinds
of
transactions
take
place
in
the
light
of
day
now
been
great
deal
of
concern
about
these
changes
so
want
to
reiterate
there
is
legitimate
role
for
these
financial
instruments
in
our
economy
they
can
help
allay
risk
and
spur
investment
and
there
are
lot
of
companies
that
use
these
instruments
to
that
legitimate
end
they
are
managing
exposure
to
fluctuating
prices
or
currencies
fluctuating
markets
for
example
business
might
hedge
against
rising
oil
prices
by
buying
financial
product
to
secure
stable
fuel
costs
so
an
airlines
might
have
an
interest
in
locking
in
decent
price
how
markets
are
supposed
to
work
the
problem
is
these
markets
operated
in
the
shadows
of
our
economy
invisible
to
regulators
invisible
to
the
public
so
reckless
practices
were
rampant
risks
accrued
until
they
threatened
our
entire
financial
system
and
why
these
reforms
are
designed
to
respect
legitimate
activities
but
prevent
reckless
risk
taking
why
we
want
to
ensure
that
financial
products
like
derivatives
are
traded
out
in
the
open
in
the
full
view
of
businesses
investors
and
those
charged
with
oversight
and
was
encouraged
to
see
republican
senator
join
with
democrats
this
week
in
moving
forward
on
this
issue
that
good
sign
that
good
sign
for
without
action
continue
to
see
what
amounts
to
gambling
in
our
financial
system
putting
taxpayers
and
the
economy
in
jeopardy
and
the
only
people
who
ought
to
fear
the
kind
of
oversight
and
transparency
that
we
proposing
are
those
whose
conduct
will
fail
this
scrutiny
third
this
plan
would
enact
the
strongest
consumer
financial
protections
ever
and
that
absolutely
necessary
because
this
financial
crisis
just
the
result
of
decisions
made
in
the
executive
suites
on
wall
street
it
was
also
the
result
of
decisions
made
around
kitchen
tables
across
america
by
folks
who
took
on
mortgages
and
credit
cards
and
auto
loans
and
while
true
that
many
americans
took
on
financial
obligations
that
they
knew
or
should
have
known
they
could
not
have
afforded
millions
of
others
were
frankly
duped
they
were
misled
by
deceptive
terms
and
conditions
buried
deep
in
the
fine
print
and
while
few
companies
made
out
like
bandits
by
exploiting
their
customers
our
entire
economy
was
made
more
vulnerable
millions
of
people
have
now
lost
their
homes
tens
of
millions
more
have
lost
value
in
their
homes
just
about
every
sector
of
our
economy
has
felt
the
pain
whether
paving
driveways
in
arizona
or
selling
houses
in
ohio
or
you
doing
home
repairs
in
california
or
using
your
home
equity
to
start
small
business
in
florida
why
we
need
to
give
consumers
more
protection
and
more
power
in
our
financial
system
this
is
not
about
stifling
competition
stifling
innovation
just
the
opposite
with
dedicated
agency
setting
ground
rules
and
looking
out
for
ordinary
people
in
our
financial
system
we
will
empower
consumers
with
clear
and
concise
information
when
making
financial
decisions
so
instead
of
competing
to
offer
confusing
products
companies
will
compete
the
way
by
offering
better
products
and
that
will
mean
more
choices
for
consumers
more
opportunities
for
businesses
and
more
stability
in
our
financial
system
and
unless
your
business
model
depends
on
people
there
is
little
to
fear
from
these
new
rules
number
four
the
last
key
component
of
reform
these
wall
street
reforms
will
give
shareholders
new
power
in
the
financial
system
they
will
get
what
we
call
say
on
pay
voice
with
respect
to
the
salaries
and
bonuses
awarded
to
top
executives
and
the
sec
will
have
the
authority
to
give
shareholders
more
say
in
corporate
elections
so
that
investors
and
pension
holders
have
stronger
role
in
determining
who
manages
the
company
in
which
placed
their
savings
now
americans
begrudge
anybody
for
success
when
that
success
is
earned
but
when
we
read
in
the
past
and
sometimes
in
the
present
about
enormous
executive
bonuses
at
firms
even
as
relying
on
assistance
from
taxpayers
or
taking
huge
risks
that
threaten
the
system
as
whole
or
their
company
is
doing
badly
it
offends
our
fundamental
values
not
only
that
some
of
the
salaries
and
bonuses
that
seen
creates
perverse
incentives
to
take
reckless
risks
that
contributed
to
the
crisis
what
helped
lead
to
relentless
focus
on
next
quarter
to
the
detriment
of
its
next
year
or
its
next
decade
and
it
led
to
situation
in
which
folks
with
the
most
to
lose
stock
and
pension
holders
had
the
least
to
say
in
the
process
and
that
has
to
change
let
me
close
by
saying
this
have
laid
out
set
of
wall
street
reforms
these
are
reforms
that
would
put
an
end
to
taxpayer
that
would
bring
complex
financial
dealings
out
of
the
shadows
that
would
protect
consumers
and
that
would
give
shareholders
more
power
in
the
financial
system
but
face
it
we
also
need
reform
in
washington
and
the
debate
the
debate
over
these
changes
is
perfect
example
mean
we
have
seen
battalions
of
financial
industry
lobbyists
descending
on
capitol
hill
firms
spending
millions
to
influence
the
outcome
of
this
debate
seen
misleading
arguments
and
attacks
that
are
designed
not
to
improve
the
bill
but
to
weaken
or
to
kill
it
seen
bipartisan
process
buckle
under
the
weight
of
these
withering
forces
even
as
produced
proposal
that
by
all
accounts
is
commonsense
reasonable
approach
to
target
the
root
problems
that
led
to
the
turmoil
in
our
financial
sector
and
ultimately
in
our
entire
economy
so
seen
business
as
usual
in
washington
but
believe
we
can
and
must
put
this
kind
of
cynical
politics
aside
got
to
put
an
end
to
it
why
here
today
why
here
today
and
to
those
of
you
who
are
in
the
financial
sector
let
me
say
this
we
will
not
always
see
eye
to
eye
we
will
not
always
agree
but
that
mean
that
got
to
choose
between
two
extremes
we
do
not
have
to
choose
between
markets
that
are
unfettered
by
even
modest
protections
against
crisis
or
markets
that
are
stymied
by
onerous
rules
that
suppress
enterprise
and
innovation
that
is
false
choice
and
we
need
no
more
proof
than
the
crisis
that
just
been
through
you
see
there
has
always
been
tension
between
the
desire
to
allow
markets
to
function
without
interference
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
rules
to
prevent
markets
from
falling
out
of
kilter
but
managing
that
tension
one
that
debated
since
the
founding
of
this
nation
is
what
has
allowed
our
country
to
keep
up
with
changing
world
for
in
taking
up
this
debate
in
figuring
out
how
to
apply
principles
with
each
new
age
we
ensure
that
we
tip
too
far
one
way
or
the
other
that
our
democracy
remains
as
dynamic
and
our
economy
remains
as
dynamic
as
it
has
in
the
past
so
yes
this
debate
can
be
contentious
it
can
be
heated
but
in
the
end
it
serves
only
to
make
our
country
stronger
it
has
allowed
us
to
adapt
and
to
thrive
and
read
report
recently
that
think
fairly
illustrates
this
point
from
time
magazine
going
to
quote
the
great
banking
houses
of
last
week
ran
alarm
big
bankers
stared
at
one
another
in
anger
and
astonishment
bill
just
would
rivet
upon
their
institutions
what
they
considered
monstrous
such
system
they
felt
would
not
only
rob
them
of
their
pride
of
profession
but
would
reduce
all
banking
to
its
lowest
that
appeared
in
time
magazine
in
june
of
the
system
that
caused
so
much
consternation
so
much
concern
was
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
also
known
as
the
an
institution
that
has
successfully
secured
the
deposits
of
generations
of
americans
in
the
end
our
system
only
works
our
markets
are
only
free
when
there
are
basic
safeguards
that
prevent
abuse
that
check
excesses
that
ensure
that
it
is
more
profitable
to
play
by
the
rules
than
to
game
the
system
and
that
is
what
the
reforms
been
proposing
are
designed
to
achieve
no
more
no
less
and
because
that
is
how
we
will
ensure
that
our
economy
works
for
consumers
that
it
works
for
investors
and
that
it
works
for
financial
institutions
in
other
words
that
it
works
for
all
of
us
why
working
so
hard
to
get
this
stuff
passed
this
is
the
central
lesson
not
only
of
this
crisis
but
of
our
history
what
said
when
spoke
here
two
years
ago
because
ultimately
there
is
no
dividing
line
between
main
street
and
wall
street
we
will
rise
or
we
will
fall
together
as
one
nation
and
that
is
why
urge
all
of
you
to
join
me
urge
all
of
you
to
join
me
to
join
those
who
are
seeking
to
pass
these
commonsense
reforms
and
for
those
of
you
in
the
financial
industry
urge
you
to
join
me
not
only
because
it
is
in
the
interest
of
your
industry
but
also
because
in
the
interest
of
your
country
thank
you
so
much
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
want
to
thank
senator
bill
and
administrator
charlie
for
their
extraordinary
leadership
want
to
buzz
aldrin
as
well
in
the
house
four
decades
ago
buzz
became
legend
but
in
the
four
decades
since
also
been
one
of
leading
visionaries
and
authorities
on
human
space
flight
few
people
present
company
excluded
can
claim
the
expertise
of
buzz
and
bill
and
charlie
when
it
comes
to
space
exploration
have
to
say
that
few
people
are
as
singularly
unimpressed
by
air
force
one
as
those
three
sure
comfortable
but
it
even
reach
low
earth
orbit
and
that
obviously
is
in
striking
contrast
to
the
falcon
rocket
we
just
saw
on
the
launch
pad
which
will
be
tested
for
the
very
first
time
in

thank
the
men

women
of
for
welcoming
me
to
the
kennedy
space
and
for
your
contributions
not
only
to
america
but
to
the
world
here
at
the
kennedy
space
we
are
surrounded
by
monuments
and
milestones
of
those
contributions
it
was
from
here
that
launched
the
missions
of
mercury
and
gemini
and
apollo
it
was
from
here
that
space
shuttle
discovery
piloted
by
charlie
carried
the
telescope
into
orbit
allowing
us
to
plumb
the
deepest
recesses
of
our
galaxy
and
should
point
out
by
the
way
that
in
my
private
office
just
off
the
oval
got
the
picture
of
jupiter
from
the
so
thank
you
charlie
for
helping
to
decorate
my
office
it
was
from
here
that
men
and
women
propelled
by
sheer
nerve
and
talent
set
about
pushing
the
boundaries
of
reach
the
story
of
and
story
that
started
little
more
than
half
century
ago
far
from
the
space
coast
in
remote
and
desolate
region
of
what
is
now
called
because
it
was
from
there
that
the
soviet
union
launched
sputnik
the
first
artificial
satellite
to
orbit
the
earth
which
was
little
more
than
few
pieces
of
metal
with
transmitter
and
battery
strapped
to
the
top
of
missile
but
the
world
was
stunned
americans
were
dumbfounded
the
it
was
perceived
had
taken
the
lead
in
race
for
which
we
were
not
yet
fully
prepared
but
we
caught
up
very
quick
president
signed
legislation
to
create
and
to
invest
in
science
and
math
education
from
grade
school
to
graduate
school
in
president
kennedy
boldly
declared
before
joint
session
of
congress
that
the
united
states
would
send
man
to
the
moon
and
return
him
safely
to
the
earth
within
the
decade
and
as
nation
we
set
about
meeting
that
goal
reaping
rewards
that
have
in
the
decades
since
touched
every
facet
of
our
lives
was
at
the
forefront
many
gave
their
careers
to
the
effort
and
some
have
given
far
more
in
the
years
that
have
followed
the
space
race
inspired
generation
of
scientists
and
innovators
including
sure
many
of
you
contributed
to
immeasurable
technological
advances
that
have
improved
our
health
and
from
satellite
navigation
to
water
purification
from
aerospace
manufacturing
to
medical
imaging
although
have
to
say
during
meeting
right
before
came
out
on
stage
somebody
said
you
know
more
than
just
tang
and
had
to
point
out
actually
really
like
tang
thought
that
was
very
cool
and
leading
the
world
to
space
helped
america
achieve
new
heights
of
prosperity
here
on
earth
while
demonstrating
the
power
of
free
and
open
society
to
harness
the
ingenuity
of
its
people
and
on
personal
note
have
been
part
of
that
generation
so
inspired
by
the
space
program
was
the
year
of
my
birth
the
year
that
kennedy
made
his
announcement
and
one
of
my
earliest
memories
is
sitting
on
my
shoulders
waving
flag
as
astronauts
arrived
in
hawaii
for
me
the
space
program
has
always
captured
an
essential
part
of
what
it
means
to
be
an
american
reaching
for
new
heights
stretching
beyond
what
previously
did
not
seem
possible
and
so
as
president
believe
that
space
exploration
is
not
luxury
not
an
afterthought
in
quest
for
brighter
future
it
is
an
essential
part
of
that
quest
so
today
like
to
talk
about
the
next
chapter
in
this
story
the
challenges
facing
our
space
program
are
different
and
our
imperatives
for
this
program
are
different
than
in
decades
past
no
longer
racing
against
an
adversary
no
longer
competing
to
achieve
singular
goal
like
reaching
the
moon
in
fact
what
was
once
global
competition
has
long
since
become
global
collaboration
but
while
the
measure
of
our
achievements
has
changed
great
deal
over
the
past
years
what
we
do
or
fail
to
do
in
seeking
new
frontiers
is
no
less
consequential
for
our
future
in
space
and
here
on
earth
so
let
me
start
by
being
extremely
clear
am
percent
committed
to
the
mission
of
and
its
future
because
broadening
our
capabilities
in
space
will
continue
to
serve
our
society
in
ways
that
we
can
scarcely
imagine
because
exploration
will
once
more
inspire
wonder
in
new
generation
sparking
passions
and
launching
careers
and
because
ultimately
if
we
fail
to
press
forward
in
the
pursuit
of
discovery
we
are
ceding
our
future
and
we
are
ceding
that
essential
element
of
the
american
character
know
there
have
been
number
of
questions
raised
about
my
plan
for
space
exploration
especially
in
this
part
of
florida
where
so
many
rely
on
as
source
of
income
as
well
as
source
of
pride
and
community
and
these
questions
come
at
time
of
transition
as
the
space
shuttle
nears
its
scheduled
retirement
after
almost
years
of
service
and
understandably
this
adds
to
the
worries
of
folks
concerned
not
only
about
their
own
futures
but
about
the
future
of
the
space
program
to
which
devoted
their
lives
but
also
know
that
underlying
these
concerns
is
deeper
worry
one
that
precedes
not
only
this
plan
but
this
administration
it
stems
from
the
sense
that
people
in
washington
driven
sometimes
less
by
vision
than
by
politics
have
for
years
neglected
mission
and
undermined
the
work
of
the
professionals
who
it
seen
that
in
the
budget
which
has
risen
and
fallen
with
the
political
winds
but
we
can
also
see
it
in
other
ways
in
the
reluctance
of
those
who
hold
office
to
set
clear
achievable
objectives
to
provide
the
resources
to
meet
those
objectives
and
to
justify
not
just
these
plans
but
the
larger
purpose
of
space
exploration
in
the
century
all
that
has
to
change
and
with
the
strategy
outlining
today
it
will
we
start
by
increasing
budget
by
billion
over
the
next
five
years
even
want
people
to
understand
the
context
of
this
this
is
happening
even
as
we
have
instituted
freeze
on
discretionary
spending
and
sought
to
make
cuts
elsewhere
in
the
budget
so
from
the
start
several
months
ago
when
issued
my
budget
was
one
of
the
areas
where
we
just
maintain
freeze
but
we
actually
increased
funding
by
billion
by
doing
that
we
will
ramp
up
robotic
exploration
of
the
solar
system
including
probe
of
the
atmosphere
new
scouting
missions
to
mars
and
other
destinations
and
an
advanced
telescope
to
follow
allowing
us
to
peer
deeper
into
the
universe
than
ever
before
we
will
increase
observation
to
improve
our
understanding
of
our
climate
and
our
world
science
that
will
garner
tangible
benefits
helping
us
to
protect
our
environment
for
future
generations
and
we
will
extend
the
life
of
the
international
space
station
likely
by
more
than
five
years
while
actually
using
it
for
its
intended
purpose
conducting
advanced
research
that
can
help
improve
the
daily
lives
of
people
here
on
earth
as
well
as
testing
and
improving
upon
our
capabilities
in
space
this
includes
technologies
like
more
efficient
life
support
systems
that
will
help
reduce
the
cost
of
future
missions
and
in
order
to
reach
the
space
station
we
will
work
with
growing
array
of
private
companies
competing
to
make
getting
to
space
easier
and
more
affordable
now
that
some
have
said
it
is
unfeasible
or
unwise
to
work
with
the
private
sector
in
this
way
disagree
the
truth
is
has
always
relied
on
private
industry
to
help
design
and
build
the
vehicles
that
carry
astronauts
to
space
from
the
mercury
capsule
that
carried
john
glenn
into
orbit
nearly
years
ago
to
the
space
shuttle
discovery
currently
orbiting
overhead
by
buying
the
services
of
space
transportation
rather
than
the
vehicles
themselves
we
can
continue
to
ensure
rigorous
safety
standards
are
met
but
we
will
also
accelerate
the
pace
of
innovations
as
companies
from
young
startups
to
established
leaders
compete
to
design
and
build
and
launch
new
means
of
carrying
people
and
materials
out
of
our
atmosphere
in
addition
as
part
of
this
effort
we
will
build
on
the
good
work
already
done
on
the
crew
capsule
directed
charlie
to
immediately
begin
developing
rescue
vehicle
using
this
technology
so
we
are
not
forced
to
rely
on
foreign
providers
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
quickly
bring
our
people
home
from
the
international
space
station
and
this
effort
will
be
part
of
the
technological
foundation
for
advanced
spacecraft
to
be
used
in
future
deep
space
missions
in
fact
will
be
readied
for
flight
right
here
in
this
room
next
we
will
invest
more
than
billion
to
conduct
research
on
an
advanced
lift
vehicle
to
efficiently
send
into
orbit
the
crew
capsules
propulsion
systems
and
large
quantities
of
supplies
needed
to
reach
deep
space
in
developing
this
new
vehicle
we
will
not
only
look
at
revising
or
modifying
older
models
we
want
to
look
at
new
designs
new
materials
new
technologies
that
will
transform
not
just
where
we
can
go
but
what
we
can
do
when
we
get
there
and
we
will
rocket
design
no
later
than
and
then
begin
to
build
it
and
want
everybody
to
understand
at
least
two
years
earlier
than
previously
planned
and
conservative
given
that
the
previous
program
was
behind
schedule
and
over
budget
at
the
same
time
after
decades
of
neglect
we
will
increase
investment
right
away
in
other
technologies
that
will
allow
astronauts
to
reach
space
sooner
and
more
often
to
travel
farther
and
faster
for
less
cost
and
to
live
and
work
in
space
for
longer
periods
of
time
more
safely
that
means
tackling
major
scientific
and
technological
challenges
how
do
we
shield
astronauts
from
radiation
on
longer
missions
how
do
we
harness
resources
on
distant
worlds
how
do
we
supply
spacecraft
with
energy
needed
for
these
journeys
these
are
questions
that
we
can
answer
and
will
answer
and
these
are
the
questions
whose
answers
no
doubt
will
reap
untold
benefits
right
here
on
earth
so
the
point
is
what
looking
for
is
not
just
to
continue
on
the
same
path
we
want
to
leap
into
the
future
we
want
major
breakthroughs
transformative
agenda
for
now
yes
pursuing
this
new
strategy
will
require
that
we
revise
the
old
strategy
in
part
this
is
because
the
old
strategy
including
the
constellation
program
was
not
fulfilling
its
promise
in
many
ways
not
just
my
assessment
also
the
assessment
of
panel
of
respected
experts
charged
with
looking
at
these
issues
closely
now
despite
this
some
have
had
harsh
words
for
the
decisions
made
including
some
individuals
who
got
enormous
respect
and
admiration
for
but
what
hope
is
is
that
everybody
will
take
look
at
what
we
are
planning
consider
the
details
of
what
laid
out
and
see
the
merits
as
described
them
the
bottom
line
is
nobody
is
more
committed
to
manned
space
flight
to
human
exploration
of
space
than
am
but
got
to
do
it
in
smart
way
and
we
just
keep
on
doing
the
same
old
things
that
been
doing
and
thinking
that
somehow
is
going
to
get
us
to
where
we
want
to
go
some
have
said
for
instance
that
this
plan
gives
up
our
leadership
in
space
by
failing
to
produce
plans
within
to
reach
low
earth
orbit
instead
of
relying
on
companies
and
other
countries
but
we
will
actually
reach
space
faster
and
more
often
under
this
new
plan
in
ways
that
will
help
us
improve
our
technological
capacity
and
lower
our
costs
which
are
both
essential
for
the
sustainability
of
space
flight
in
fact
through
our
plan
be
sending
many
more
astronauts
to
space
over
the
next
decade
there
are
also
those
who
our
decision
to
end
parts
of
constellation
as
one
that
will
hinder
space
exploration
below
sic
low
earth
orbit
but
precisely
by
investing
in
research
and
innovative
companies
that
we
will
have
the
potential
to
rapidly
transform
our
capabilities
even
as
we
build
on
the
important
work
already
completed
through
projects
like
for
future
missions
and
unlike
the
previous
program
we
are
setting
course
with
specific
and
achievable
milestones
early
in
the
next
decade
set
of
crewed
flights
will
test
and
prove
the
systems
required
for
exploration
beyond
low
earth
orbit
and
by
we
expect
new
spacecraft
designed
for
long
journeys
to
allow
us
to
begin
the
crewed
missions
beyond
the
moon
into
deep
space
so
start
start
by
sending
astronauts
to
an
asteroid
for
the
first
time
in
history
by
the
believe
we
can
send
humans
to
orbit
mars
and
return
them
safely
to
earth
and
landing
on
mars
will
follow
and
expect
to
be
around
to
see
it
but
want
to
repeat
want
to
repeat
this
critical
to
deep
space
exploration
will
be
the
development
of
breakthrough
propulsion
systems
and
other
advanced
technologies
so
challenging
to
break
through
these
barriers
and
give
you
the
resources
to
break
through
these
barriers
and
know
you
will
with
ingenuity
and
intensity
because
what
always
done
now
understand
that
some
believe
that
we
should
attempt
return
to
the
surface
of
the
moon
first
as
previously
planned
but
just
have
to
say
pretty
bluntly
here
been
there
before
buzz
has
been
there
lot
more
of
space
to
explore
and
lot
more
to
learn
when
we
do
so
believe
more
important
to
ramp
up
our
capabilities
to
reach
and
operate
at
series
of
increasingly
demanding
targets
while
advancing
our
technological
capabilities
with
each
step
forward
and
what
this
strategy
does
and
how
we
will
ensure
that
our
leadership
in
space
is
even
stronger
in
this
new
century
than
it
was
in
the
last
finally
want
to
say
few
words
about
jobs
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
last
time
was
here
made
very
clear
promise
that
would
help
in
the
transition
into
new
program
to
make
sure
that
people
who
are
already
going
through
tough
time
here
in
this
region
were
helped
and
despite
some
reports
to
the
contrary
my
plan
will
add
more
than
jobs
along
the
space
coast
in
the
next
two
years
compared
to
the
plan
under
the
previous
administration
so
want
to
make
that
point
going
to
the
kennedy
space
creating
jobs
as
we
upgrade
launch
facilities
and
potential
for
even
more
jobs
as
companies
in
florida
and
across
america
compete
to
be
part
of
new
space
transportation
industry
and
some
of
those
industry
leaders
are
here
today
this
holds
the
promise
of
generating
more
than
jobs
nationwide
over
the
next
few
years
and
many
of
these
jobs
will
be
created
right
here
in
florida
because
this
is
an
area
primed
to
lead
in
this
competition
now
true
there
are
who
will
see
their
work
on
the
shuttle
end
as
the
program
winds
down
this
is
based
on
decision
that
was
made
six
years
ago
not
six
months
ago
but
that
make
it
any
less
painful
for
families
and
communities
affected
as
this
decision
becomes
reality
so
proposing
in
part
because
of
strong
lobbying
by
bill
and
by
as
well
as
charlie
proposing
million
initiative
led
by
team
from
the
white
house
and
other
agencies
to
develop
plan
for
regional
economic
growth
and
job
creation
and
expect
this
plan
to
reach
my
desk
by
august
an
effort
that
will
help
prepare
this
already
skilled
workforce
for
new
opportunities
in
the
space
industry
and
beyond
so
this
is
the
next
chapter
that
we
can
write
together
here
at
we
will
partner
with
industry
we
will
invest
in
research
and
technology
we
will
set
milestones
and
provide
the
resources
to
reach
those
milestones
and
step
by
step
we
will
push
the
boundaries
not
only
of
where
we
can
go
but
what
we
can
do
fifty
years
after
the
creation
of
our
goal
is
no
longer
just
destination
to
reach
our
goal
is
the
capacity
for
people
to
work
and
learn
and
operate
and
live
safely
beyond
the
earth
for
extended
periods
of
time
ultimately
in
ways
that
are
more
sustainable
and
even
indefinite
and
in
fulfilling
this
task
we
will
not
only
extend
reach
in
space
we
will
strengthen
leadership
here
on
earth
now
close
by
saying
this
know
that
some
americans
have
asked
question
particularly
apt
on
tax
day
why
spend
money
on
at
all
why
spend
money
solving
problems
in
space
when
we
lack
for
problems
to
solve
here
on
the
ground
and
obviously
our
country
is
still
reeling
from
the
worst
economic
turmoil
known
in
generations
we
have
massive
structural
deficits
that
have
to
be
closed
in
the
coming
years
but
you
and
know
this
is
false
choice
we
have
to
fix
our
economy
we
need
to
close
our
deficits
but
for
pennies
on
the
dollar
the
space
program
has
jobs
and
entire
industries
for
pennies
on
the
dollar
the
space
program
has
improved
our
lives
advanced
our
society
strengthened
our
economy
and
inspired
generations
of
americans
and
have
no
doubt
that
can
continue
to
this
role
but
that
is
why
but
want
to
say
clearly
to
those
of
you
who
work
for
but
to
the
entire
community
that
has
been
so
supportive
of
the
space
program
in
this
area
that
is
exactly
why
so
essential
that
we
pursue
new
course
and
that
we
and
its
mission
not
just
with
dollars
but
with
clear
aims
and
larger
purpose
now
little
more
than
years
ago
astronauts
descended
the
ladder
of
the
lunar
module
called
eagle
and
allowed
their
feet
to
touch
the
dusty
surface
of
the
only
moon
this
was
the
culmination
of
daring
and
perilous
gambit
of
an
that
pushed
the
boundaries
of
our
knowledge
of
our
technological
prowess
of
our
very
capacity
as
human
beings
to
solve
problems
it
just
the
greatest
achievement
in
history
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
achievements
in
human
history
and
the
question
for
us
now
is
whether
that
was
the
beginning
of
something
or
the
end
of
something
choose
to
believe
it
was
only
the
beginning
so
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
good
afternoon
everybody
want
to
say
few
words
about
the
tragedy
that
took
place
this
week
in
west
virginia
but
before
do
first
like
to
comment
on
the
news
that
justice
john
paul
will
retire
from
the
supreme
court
at
the
end
of
its
current
term
when
president
ford
was
faced
with
supreme
court
vacancy
shortly
after
the
nation
was
still
recovering
from
the
scandal
he
wanted
nominee
who
was
brilliant
pragmatic
and
committed
above
all
to
justice
integrity
and
the
rule
of
law
he
found
that
nominee
in
john
paul
justice
has
courageously
served
his
country
from
the
moment
he
enlisted
the
day
before
pearl
to
his
long
and
distinguished
tenure
on
the
supreme
court
during
that
tenure
he
has
stood
as
an
impartial
guardian
of
the
law
he
has
worn
the
judicial
robe
with
and
humility
he
has
applied
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
land
with
fidelity
and
restraint
he
will
soon
turn
this
month
but
he
leaves
his
position
at
the
top
of
his
game
his
leadership
will
be
sorely
missed
and
just
had
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
him
and
told
him
on
behalf
of
grateful
nation
that
thanked
him
for
his
service
as
justice
expressed
to
me
in
the
letter
announcing
his
retirement
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
supreme
court
to
have
successor
appointed
and
confirmed
before
the
next
term
begins
and
so
will
move
quickly
to
name
nominee
as
did
with
justice
once
again
view
the
process
of
selecting
supreme
court
nominee
as
among
my
most
serious
responsibilities
as
president
and
while
we
can
not
replace
justice
experience
or
wisdom
will
seek
someone
in
the
coming
weeks
with
similar
qualities
an
independent
mind
record
of
excellence
and
integrity
fierce
dedication
to
the
rule
of
law
and
keen
understanding
of
how
the
law
affects
the
daily
lives
of
the
american
people
it
will
also
be
someone
who
like
justice
knows
that
in
democracy
powerful
interests
must
not
be
allowed
to
drown
out
the
voices
of
ordinary
citizens
much
like
they
did
with
justice
hope
the
senate
will
move
quickly
in
the
coming
weeks
to
debate
and
then
confirm
my
nominee
so
that
the
new
justice
is
seated
in
time
for
the
fall
term
now
let
me
say
few
words
about
what
has
happened
in
west
virginia
this
has
been
an
unimaginably
difficult
week
for
the
people
who
live
near
workers
were
inside
the
upper
big
branch
mine
when
an
explosion
ripped
through
its
walls
on
monday
afternoon
two
were
saved
were
lost
and
for
the
four
who
remain
missing
we
are
praying
for
miracle
want
to
offer
my
deepest
condolences
to
the
friends
and
the
families
of
the
fathers
and
the
husbands
and
brothers
nephews
and
sons
who
were
killed
in
this
accident
also
in
awe
of
the
courage
and
shown
by
the
rescue
teams
risked
their
lives
over
and
over
and
over
this
week
for
the
chance
to
save
another
worked
around
the
clock
with
little
sleep
for
the
past
few
days
and
this
nation
owes
them
debt
of
gratitude
now
mining
has
long
and
proud
history
in
west
virginia
for
many
families
and
communities
not
just
way
to
make
living
way
of
life
and
the
jobs
they
do
in
these
mines
help
bring
heat
and
electricity
to
millions
of
americans
profession
not
without
risks
and
danger
and
the
workers
and
their
families
know
that
but
their
government
and
their
employers
know
that
they
owe
it
to
these
families
to
do
everything
possible
to
ensure
their
safety
when
they
go
to
work
each
day
when
was
in
the
senate
supported
the
efforts
of
senators
and
to
try
and
improve
mine
safety
but
clear
that
more
needs
to
be
done
and
why
asked
my
secretary
of
as
well
as
the
head
of
the
mine
safety
and
health
administration
to
give
me
preliminary
report
next
week
on
what
went
wrong
and
why
it
went
wrong
so
badly
so
that
we
can
take
the
steps
necessary
to
prevent
such
accidents
in
the
future
because
mining
is
tradition
often
passed
down
through
generations
not
uncommon
to
see
an
entire
family
choose
this
line
of
work
and
sadly
when
tragedy
like
this
occurs
also
not
uncommon
to
lose
almost
an
entire
family
all
at
once
spoke
to
some
surviving
members
of
one
such
family
on
this
week
and
two
of
his
nephews
age
and
age
were
killed
in
the
explosion
in
the
upper
big
branch
mine
rescuers
have
reported
that
and
his
two
nephews
were
all
found
together
two
other
members
of
their
families
that
worked
in
the
mine
were
able
to
escape
unharmed
before
he
left
for
the
mine
on
monday
wrote
letter
for
his
girlfriend
and
young
daughter
and
in
it
he
said
anything
happens
to
me
be
looking
down
from
heaven
at
you
all
love
you
take
care
of
my
baby
tell
her
that
daddy
loves
her
beautiful
funny
just
take
care
of
my
baby
reflecting
on
that
letter
and
the
losses
she
endured
in
just
one
week
mother
simply
said
is
just
west
virginia
when
something
bad
happens
we
come
when
something
bad
happens
we
come
together
through
tragedy
and
heartache
the
spirit
that
has
sustained
this
community
and
this
country
for
over
years
and
as
we
pray
for
the
souls
of
those
lost
and
the
safe
return
of
those
who
are
missing
we
are
also
sustained
by
the
words
of
the
psalm
that
are
particularly
poignant
right
now
those
words
read
lord
keep
my
lamp
burning
my
god
turns
my
darkness
into
thank
you
very
much
got
few
introductions
that
want
to
make
very
quickly
before
start
my
remarks
first
of
all
think
that
by
the
end
of
his
tenure
we
going
to
know
that
ken
is
one
of
the
finest
secretaries
of
interior
we
ever
had
so
please
give
him
big
round
of
applause
other
members
of
what
we
call
our
green
team
are
here
our
secretary
of
energy
the
administrator
of
the
the
chair
we
got
carol
browner
the
white
house
energy
and
climate
change
director
please
give
them
big

and
the
leadership
that
present
from
the
air
force
the
marine
corps
and
the
coast
guard
ken
and
were
colleagues
in
the
senate
and
appointed
him
because
knew
that
he
would
be
faithful
and
pragmatic
steward
of
our
natural
resources
and
as
secretary
he
is
changing
the
way
that
the
interior
department
does
business
so
that
responsibly
developing
traditional
sources
of
energy
and
renewable
sources
of
energy
from
the
wind
on
the
high
plains
to
the
suns
in
the
desert
to
the
waves
off
our
coasts
and
so
very
grateful
to
the
work
that
done
in
culminating
in
one
of
the
announcements
that
making
today
also
good
to
see
so
many
members
of
our
armed
forces
here
today
is
the
home
of
air
force
one
and
appreciate
everything
that
you
do
for
me
and
my
family
should
point
out
that
got
departure
record
you
charge
for
luggage
so
pretty
good
deal
and
want
to
thank
you
not
only
for
the
support
that
you
provide
me
but
also
for
the
service
that
you
perform
to
keep
our
country
safe
each
and
every
day
so
very
grateful
to
all
of
you
here
to
talk
about
energy
security
an
issue
been
priority
for
my
administration
since
the
day
took
office
already
made
the
largest
investment
in
clean
energy
in
our
history
an
investment
expected
to
create
or
save
more
than
jobs
across
america
jobs
manufacturing
advanced
batteries
for
more
efficient
vehicles
upgrading
the
power
grid
so
that
smarter
and
stronger
doubling
our
capacity
to
generate
renewable
electricity
from
sources
like
the
wind
and
the
sun
and
just
few
months
after
taking
office
also
gathered
the
leaders
of
the
largest
the
heads
of
unions
environmental
advocates
and
public
officials
from
california
and
across
the
country
to
reach
historic
agreement
to
raise
fuel
economy
standards
in
cars
and
trucks
and
tomorrow
after
decades
in
which
we
have
done
little
to
increase
auto
efficiency
those
new
standards
will
be
which
will
reduce
our
dependence
on
oil
while
helping
folks
spend
little
less
at
the
pump
so
my
administration
is
upholding
its
end
of
the
deal
and
we
expect
all
parties
to
do
the
same
and
also
point
out
this
rule
that
going
to
be
announcing
about
increased
mileage
standards
will
save
billion
billion
barrels
of
oil
overall
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
like
taking
million
cars
off
the
road
for
an
entire
year
today
also
going
to
go
one
step
further
in
order
to
save
energy
and
taxpayer
dollars
my
administration
led
by
secretary
at
energy
as
well
as
administrator
at
is
doubling
the
number
of
hybrid
vehicles
in
the
federal
fleet
even
as
we
seek
to
reduce
the
number
of
cars
and
trucks
used
by
our
government
overall
so
going
to
lead
by
example
and
practice
what
we
preach
cutting
waste
saving
energy
and
reducing
our
reliance
on
foreign
oil
but
we
have
to
do
more
we
need
to
make
continued
investments
in
clean
coal
technologies
and
advanced
few
weeks
ago
announced
loan
guarantees
to
break
ground
on
first
new
nuclear
facility
in
three
decades
project
that
will
create
thousands
of
jobs
and
in
the
short
term
as
we
transition
to
cleaner
energy
sources
still
got
to
make
some
tough
decisions
about
opening
new
offshore
areas
for
oil
and
gas
development
in
ways
that
protect
communities
and
protect
coastlines
this
is
not
decision
that
made
lightly
one
that
ken
and
as
well
as
carol
browner
my
energy
and
others
in
my
administration
looked
at
closely
for
more
than
year
but
the
bottom
line
is
this
given
our
energy
needs
in
order
to
sustain
economic
growth
and
produce
jobs
and
keep
our
businesses
competitive
we
are
going
to
need
to
harness
traditional
sources
of
fuel
even
as
we
ramp
up
production
of
new
sources
of
renewable
energy
so
today
announcing
the
expansion
of
offshore
oil
and
gas
exploration
but
in
ways
that
balance
the
need
to
harness
domestic
energy
resources
and
the
need
to
protect
natural
resources
under
the
leadership
of
secretary
employ
new
technologies
that
reduce
the
impact
of
oil
exploration
protect
areas
that
are
vital
to
tourism
the
environment
and
our
national
security
and
be
guided
not
by
political
ideology
but
by
scientific
evidence
that
why
my
administration
will
consider
potential
areas
for
development
in
the
mid
and
south
atlantic
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
while
studying
and
protecting
sensitive
areas
in
the
arctic
why
continue
to
support
development
of
leased
areas
off
the
north
slope
of
alaska
while
protecting
bay
there
will
be
those
who
strongly
disagree
with
this
decision
including
those
who
say
we
should
not
open
any
new
areas
to
drilling
but
what
want
to
is
that
this
announcement
is
part
of
broader
strategy
that
will
move
us
from
an
economy
that
runs
on
fossil
fuels
and
foreign
oil
to
one
that
relies
more
on
fuels
and
clean
energy
and
the
only
way
this
transition
will
succeed
is
if
it
strengthens
our
economy
in
the
short
term
and
the
long
run
to
fail
to
this
reality
would
be
mistake
on
the
other
side
there
are
going
to
be
some
who
argue
that
we
go
nearly
far
enough
who
suggest
we
should
open
all
our
waters
to
energy
exploration
without
any
restriction
or
regard
for
the
broader
environmental
and
economic
impact
and
to
those
folks
got
to
say
this
we
have
less
than
percent
of
the
oil
reserves
we
consume
more
than
percent
of
the
oil
and
what
that
means
is
that
drilling
alone
come
close
to
meeting
our
energy
needs
and
for
the
sake
of
our
planet
and
our
energy
independence
we
need
to
begin
the
transition
to
cleaner
fuels
now
so
the
answer
is
not
drilling
everywhere
all
the
time
but
the
answer
is
not
also
for
us
to
ignore
the
fact
that
we
are
going
to
need
vital
energy
sources
to
maintain
our
economic
growth
and
our
security
ultimately
we
need
to
move
beyond
the
tired
debates
of
the
left
and
the
right
between
business
leaders
and
environmentalists
between
those
who
would
claim
drilling
is
cure
all
and
those
who
would
claim
it
has
no
place
because
this
issue
is
just
too
important
to
allow
our
progress
to
languish
while
we
fight
the
same
old
battles
over
and
over
again
for
decades
talked
about
how
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
threatens
our
economy
yet
our
will
to
act
rises
and
falls
with
the
price
of
barrel
of
oil
when
gas
gets
expensive
at
the
pump
suddenly
everybody
is
an
energy
expert
and
when
it
goes
back
down
everybody
is
back
to
their
old
habits
for
decades
talked
about
the
threat
to
future
generations
posed
by
our
current
system
of
energy
even
as
we
can
see
the
mounting
evidence
of
climate
change
from
the
arctic
circle
to
the
gulf
coast
and
this
is
particularly
relevant
to
all
of
you
who
are
serving
in
uniform
for
decades
talked
about
the
risks
to
our
security
created
by
dependence
on
foreign
oil
but
that
dependence
has
actually
grown
year
after
year
after
year
after
year
and
while
our
politics
has
remained
entrenched
along
these
worn
divides
the
ground
has
shifted
beneath
our
feet
around
the
world
countries
are
seeking
an
edge
in
the
global
marketplace
by
investing
in
new
ways
of
producing
and
saving
energy
from
china
to
germany
these
nations
that
the
nation
that
leads
the
clean
energy
economy
will
be
the
country
that
leads
the
global
economy
and
meanwhile
here
at
home
as
politicians
in
washington
debate
endlessly
about
whether
to
act
our
own
military
has
determined
that
we
can
no
longer
afford
not
to
some
of
the
press
may
be
wondering
why
we
are
announcing
offshore
drilling
in
hangar
at
air
force
base
well
if
any
doubt
about
the
leadership
that
our
military
is
showing
you
just
need
to
look
at
this
fighter
and
the
vehicle
behind
me
the
army
and
marine
corps
have
been
testing
this
vehicle
on
mixture
of
and
this
navy
fighter
jet
appropriately
called
the
green
hornet
will
be
flown
for
the
first
time
in
just
few
days
on
earth
day
if
tests
go
as
planned
it
will
be
the
first
plane
ever
to
fly
faster
than
the
speed
of
sound
on
fuel
mix
that
is
half
biomass
the
air
force
is
also
testing
jet
engines
using
and
had
the
first
successful
test
flight
just
last
week
want
to
drum
up
any
kind
of
rivalry
here
but
now
the
pentagon
seeking
these
alternative
fuels
just
to
protect
our
environment
pursuing
these
energy
sources
to
protect
our
national
security
our
military
leaders
the
security
imperative
of
increasing
the
use
of
alternative
fuels
decreasing
energy
use
reducing
our
reliance
on
imported
oil
making
ourselves
more
why
the
navy
led
by
secretary
here
today
has
set
goal
of
using
alternative
fuels
in
all
planes
vehicles
and
ships
in
the
next
years
why
the
department
has
invested
billion
dollars
this
year
alone
to
improve
energy
efficiency
so
moving
towards
clean
energy
is
about
our
security
also
about
our
economy
and
about
the
future
of
our
planet
and
what
hope
is
is
the
policies
that
laid
out
from
hybrid
fleets
to
offshore
drilling
from
nuclear
energy
to
wind
energy
the
seriousness
with
which
my
administration
takes
this
challenge
challenge
that
requires
us
to
break
out
of
the
old
ways
of
thinking
to
think
and
act
anew
and
it
requires
each
of
us
regardless
of
whether
in
the
private
sector
or
the
public
sector
whether
in
the
military
or
in
the
civilian
side
of
government
to
think
about
how
could
we
be
doing
things
better
how
could
we
be
doing
things
smarter
so
that
we
are
no
longer
tethered
to
the
whims
of
what
happens
somewhere
in
the
middle
east
or
with
other
major
nations
so
open
to
proposals
from
my
democratic
friends
and
my
republican
friends
think
that
we
can
break
out
of
the
broken
politics
of
the
past
when
it
comes
to
our
energy
policy
know
that
we
can
come
together
to
pass
comprehensive
energy
and
climate
legislation
going
to
foster
new
energy
new
industries
create
millions
of
new
jobs
protect
our
planet
and
help
us
become
more
energy
independent
what
we
can
do
that
is
what
we
must
do
and
confident
that
is
what
we
will
do
so
thank
you
very
much
and
thanks
again
to
all
of
you
who
are
serving
in
our
armed
services
you
are
making
an
enormous
contribution
and
this
is
just
one
example
of
the
leadership
that
showing
thank
you
very
much
it
going
well
you
know
it
turns
out
that
the
american
people
they
let
me
use
this
plane
called
air
force
one
and
so
thought
come
over
and
say
hello
couple
of
people
want
to
thank
in
addition
to
sergeant

the
outstanding

we

for
most
of

get
lot
of
notice
that

want

than

privilege

extraordinary
efforts

sons

so
my
main
job
here
today
is
to
say
thank
you
on
behalf
of
the
entire
american
people

are
part
of
the
finest
military
in
the
history

the
sacrifices
that
you
have
made
and
your
families
have
made
to
keep
america
safe
and
to
keep
america
secure
in
this
vital
mission
and
know
not
easy
far
away
from
home
you
miss
your
kids
you
miss
your
spouses
your
family
your
friends
some
of
you
this
is
your
second
or
your
third
or
your
fourth
tour
of
duty
tell
you
right
now
the
same
thing
that
said
at
west
point
last
december
if
thought
for
minute
that
vital
interests
were
not
served
were
not
at
stake
here
in
would
order
all
of
you
home
right
away
so
want
you
to
know
want
every
american
serving
in
military
and
civilian
to
know
whether
working
the
flight
line
here
at
or
patrolling
village
down
in
whether
standing
watch
at
forward
operating
base
or
training
our
afghan
partners
or
working
with
the
afghan
government
your
services
are
absolutely
necessary
absolutely
essential
to
safety
and
security
those
folks
back
home
are
relying
on
you
we
forget
why
here
we
did
not
choose
this
war
this
was
not
an
act
of
america
wanting
to
expand
its
influence
of
us
wanting
to
meddle
in
somebody
business
we
were
attacked
viciously
on
thousands
of
our
fellow
countrymen
and
women
were
killed
and
this
is
the
region
where
the
perpetrators
of
that
crime
still
base
their
leadership
plots
against
our
homeland
plots
against
our
allies
plots
against
the
afghan
and
people
are
taking
place
as
we
speak
right
here
and
if
this
region
slides
backwards
if
the
retakes
this
country
and
can
operate
with
impunity
then
more
american
lives
will
be
at
stake
the
afghan
people
will
lose
their
chance
at
progress
and
prosperity
and
the
world
will
be
significantly
less
secure
and
as
long
as
your
am
not
going
to
let
that
happen
why
you
are
here
made
promise
to
all
of
you
who
serve
will
never
send
you
into
way
unless
absolutely
necessary
anguish
in
thinking
about
the
sacrifices
that
so
many
of
you
make
why
promise
will
never
send
you
out
unless
it
is
necessary
but
only
part
of
the
promise
because
the
other
part
of
the
promise
is
that
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
you
will
be
backed
up
by
clear
mission
and
the
right
strategy
to
finish
the
job
to
get
the
job
done
and
am
confident
all
of
you
are
going
to
get
the
job
done
right
here
in
am
confident
of
that
why
ordered
more
troops
and
civilians
here
into
shortly
after
taking
office
why
we
took
hard
look
and
forged
new
strategy
and
committed
more
resources
in
december
why
we
pushed
our
friends
and
allies
and
partners
to
pony
up
more
resources
themselves
more
commitments
of
aid
and
additional
forces
and
trainers
our
broad
mission
is
clear
we
are
going
to
disrupt
and
dismantle
defeat
and
destroy
and
its
extremist
allies
that
is
our
mission
and
to
accomplish
that
goal
our
objectives
here
in
are
also
clear
going
to
deny
safe
haven
going
to
reverse
the
momentum
going
to
strengthen
the
capacity
of
afghan
security
forces
and
the
afghan
government
so
that
they
can
begin
taking
responsibility
and
gain
confidence
of
the
afghan
people
and
our
strategy
includes
military
effort
that
takes
the
fight
to
the
while
creating
the
conditions
for
greater
security
and
transition
to
the
afghans
but
also
civilian
effort
that
improves
the
daily
lives
of
the
afghan
people
and
combats
corruption
and
partnership
with
pakistan
and
its
people
because
we
uproot
extremists
and
advance
security
and
opportunity
unless
we
succeed
on
both
sides
of
the
border
most
of
you
understand
that
many
of
the
troops
that
ordered
to
have
begun
to
arrive
and
more
are
on
the
way
and
continue
to
work
with
congress
to
make
sure
that
got
the
equipment
that
you
need
particularly
as
we
complete
our
in
iraq
providing
more
helicopters
providing
more
intelligence
and
reconnaissance
capabilities
more
special
operations
forces
more
vehicles
that
can
save
lives
and
here
in
gone
on
the
offensive
and
the
american
people
back
home
are
noticing
we
have
seen
huge
increase
in
support
in
because
people
understand
the
kinds
of
sacrifices
that
you
guys
are
making
and
the
clarity
of
mission
that
bringing
to
bear
and
together
with
our
coalition
and
afghan
partners
our
troops
have
pushed
the
out
of
their
stronghold
in
changed
the
way
we
operate
and
interact
with
the
afghan
people
we
see
afghans
reclaiming
their
communities
and
we
see
new
partnerships
that
will
help
them
build
their
own
future
and
increase
their
security
and
across
the
border
pakistan
is
mounting
major
offensives
seen
violent
extremists
pushed
out
of
their
sanctuaries
struck
major
blows
against
leadership
as
well
as
the
they
are
down
worried
about
their
own
safety
harder
for
them
to
move
harder
for
them
to
train
and
to
plot
and
to
attack
and
all
of
that
makes
america
safer
and
we
are
going
to
keep
them
on
the
run
because
that
is
going
to
be
required
in
order
to
assure
that
our
families
back
home
have
the
security
that
they
need
the
work
that
you
are
doing
so
thanks
to
you
been
progress
these
last
several
months
but
we
know
there
are
going
to
be
some
difficult
days
ahead

to
be
setbacks
we
face
determined
enemy
but
we
also
know
this

united
states
of
america

that
and

know
that

your
duty

do
right

to
people
who
have
known
lot
of
pain
and
lot
of

our
allies
it
matters
to
the
afghan
people
and
the
violent
extremists
who
fighting
against
want
to
destroy
but
all
of
you
want
to
build
and
that
is
something
essential
about
america
got
no
respect
for
human
life
you
see
dignity
in
every
human
being
part
of
what
we
value
as
americans
they
want
to
drive
races
and
regions
and
religions
apart
you
want
to
bring
people
together
and
see
the
world
move
forward
together
they
offer
fear
in
other
words
and
you
offer
hope
and
why
it
is
so
important
that
you
know
that
the
entire
country
stands
behind

an
uncertain
world
the

always
stand
up
for
the
security
of
nations

dignity
of
human
beings

so
long
as
brave
men

americans
who
are
willing
to
serve
selflessly
half
world
away
on
behalf
of
their
fellow
citizens
and
the
dreams
of
people
never
met
so
long
as
there
are
folks
like

will
overcome
fear

am
confident
that
better
days
lie

thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
armed
forces
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
today
after
almost
century
of
trying
today
after
over
year
of
debate
today
after
all
the
votes
have
been
tallied
health
insurance
reform
becomes
law
in
the
united
states
of
america
today
it
is
fitting
that
congress
passed
this
historic
legislation
this
week
for
as
we
mark
the
turning
of
spring
we
also
mark
new
season
in
america
in
few
moments
when
sign
this
bill
all
of
the
overheated
rhetoric
over
reform
will
finally
confront
the
reality
of
reform
and
while
the
senate
still
has
last
round
of
improvements
to
make
on
this
historic
legislation
and
these
are
improvements
confident
they
will
make
swiftly
the
bill
signing
will
set
in
motion
reforms
that
generations
of
americans
have
fought
for
and
marched
for
and
hungered
to
see
it
will
take
four
years
to
implement
fully
many
of
these
reforms
because
we
need
to
implement
them
responsibly
we
need
to
get
this
right
but
host
of
desperately
needed
reforms
will
take
effect
right
away
this
year
start
offering
tax
credits
to
about
million
small
businessmen
and
women
to
help
them
cover
the
cost
of
insurance
for
their
employees
that
happens
this
year
this
year
tens
of
thousands
of
uninsured
americans
with
conditions
the
parents
of
children
who
have
condition
will
finally
be
able
to
purchase
the
coverage
they
need
that
happens
this
year
this
year
insurance
companies
will
no
longer
be
able
to
drop
coverage
when
they
get
sick
they
be
able
to
place
lifetime
limits
or
restrictive
annual
limits
on
the
amount
of
care
they
can
receive
this
year
all
new
insurance
plans
will
be
required
to
offer
free
preventive
care
and
this
year
young
adults
will
be
able
to
stay
on
their
policies
until
years
old
that
happens
this
year
and
this
year
seniors
who
fall
in
the
coverage
gap
known
as
the
doughnut
hole
will
start
getting
some
help
receive
dollars
to
help
pay
for
prescriptions
and
that
will
over
time
fill
in
the
doughnut
hole
and
want
seniors
to
know
despite
what
some
have
said
these
reforms
will
not
cut
your
guaranteed
benefits
in
fact
under
this
law
americans
on
will
receive
free
preventive
care
without
or
that
begins
this
year
once
this
reform
is
implemented
health
insurance
exchanges
will
be
created
competitive
marketplace
where
uninsured
people
and
small
businesses
will
finally
be
able
to
purchase
affordable
quality
insurance
they
will
be
able
to
be
part
of
big
pool
and
get
the
same
good
deal
that
members
of
congress
get
going
to
happen
under
this
reform
and
when
this
exchange
is
up
and
running
millions
of
people
will
get
tax
breaks
to
help
them
afford
coverage
which
represents
the
largest
tax
cut
for
health
care
in
history
that
what
this
reform
is
about
this
legislation
will
also
lower
costs
for
families
and
for
businesses
and
for
the
federal
government
reducing
our
deficit
by
over
one
trillion
dollars
in
the
next
two
decades
it
is
paid
for
it
is
fiscally
responsible
and
it
will
help
lift
drag
on
our
economy
that
part
of
what
all
of
you
together
worked
on
and
made
happen
that
our
generation
is
able
to
succeed
in
passing
this
reform
is
testament
to
the
persistence
and
the
character
of
the
american
people
who
championed
this
cause
who
who
who
believed
that
people
who
love
this
country
can
change
it
also
testament
to
the
historic
leadership
and
uncommon
courage
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
congress
taken
their
lumps
during
this
difficult
debate
audience
member
yes
we
did
the
president
you
know
there
are
few
tougher
jobs
in
politics
or
government
than
leading
one
of
our
legislative
chambers
in
each
chamber
there
are
men
and
women
who
come
from
different
places
and
face
different
pressures
who
reach
different
conclusions
about
the
same
things
and
feel
deeply
concerned
about
different
things
by
necessity
leaders
have
to
speak
to
those
different
concerns
it
always
tidy
it
is
almost
never
easy
but
perhaps
the
greatest
and
most
difficult
challenge
is
to
cobble
together
out
of
those
differences
the
sense
of
common
interest
and
common
purpose
required
to
advance
the
dreams
of
all
people
especially
in
country
as
large
and
diverse
as
ours
and
we
are
blessed
by
leaders
in
each
chamber
who
not
only
do
their
jobs
very
well
but
who
never
lost
sight
of
that
larger
mission
they
play
for
the
short
term
they
play
to
the
polls
or
to
politics
one
of
the
best
speakers
the
house
of
representatives
has
ever
had
speaker
audience
the
president
one
of
the
best
majority
leaders
the
senate
has
ever
had
harry
to
all
of
the
terrific
committee
chairs
all
the
members
of
congress
who
did
what
was
difficult
but
did
what
was
right
and
passed
health
care
reform
not
just
this
generation
of
americans
will
thank
you
but
the
next
generation
of
americans
will
thank
you
and
of
course
this
victory
was
also
made
possible
by
the
painstaking
work
of
members
of
this
administration
including
our
outstanding
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
one
of
the
unsung
of
this
effort
an
extraordinary
woman
who
led
the
reform
effort
from
the
white
house
today
signing
this
reform
bill
into
law
on
behalf
of
my
mother
who
argued
with
insurance
companies
even
as
she
battled
cancer
in
her
final
days
signing
it
for
smith
here
today
he
runs
small
business
with
five
employees
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
paying
half
the
cost
of
coverage
for
his
workers
this
bill
will
help
him
afford
that
coverage
signing
it
for
also
here
lost
his
mom
to
an
illness
and
she
have
insurance
and
afford
the
care
that
she
needed
so
in
her
memory
he
has
told
her
story
across
america
so
that
no
other
children
have
to
go
through
what
his
family
has
experienced
signing
it
for
had
to
give
up
her
health
coverage
after
her
rates
were
jacked
up
by
more
than
percent
she
was
terrified
that
an
illness
would
mean
lose
the
house
that
her
parents
built
so
she
gave
up
her
insurance
now
lying
in
hospital
bed
as
we
speak
faced
with
just
such
an
illness
praying
that
she
can
somehow
afford
to
get
well
without
insurance
family
is
here
today
because
be
and
her
sister
is
here
stand
up
signing
this
bill
for
all
the
leaders
who
took
up
this
cause
through
the
generations
from
teddy
to
from
harry
to
from
bill
and
to
one
of
the
deans
been
fighting
this
so
long
john
to
senator
ted
kennedy
and
fitting
that
widow
is
here
fitting
that
widow
is
here
and
his
niece
his
son
whose
vote
helped
make
this
reform
reality
remember
seeing
ted
walk
through
that
door
in
summit
in
this
room
year
ago
one
of
his
last
public
appearances
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
make
it
but
he
was
confident
that
we
would
do
the
right
thing
our
presence
here
today
is
remarkable
and
improbable
with
all
the
all
of
the
lobbying
all
of
the
that
passes
for
governing
in
washington
been
easy
at
times
to
doubt
our
ability
to
do
such
big
thing
such
complicated
thing
to
wonder
if
there
are
limits
to
what
we
as
people
can
still
achieve
easy
to
succumb
to
the
sense
of
cynicism
about
possible
in
this
country
but
today
we
are
affirming
that
essential
truth
truth
every
generation
is
called
to
rediscover
for
itself
that
we
are
not
nation
that
scales
back
its
aspirations
we
are
not
nation
that
falls
prey
to
doubt
or
mistrust
we
do
fall
prey
to
fear
we
are
not
nation
that
does
easy
not
who
we
are
not
how
we
got
here
we
are
nation
that
faces
its
challenges
and
accepts
its
responsibilities
we
are
nation
that
does
what
is
hard
what
is
necessary
what
is
right
here
in
this
country
we
shape
our
own
destiny
that
is
what
we
do
that
is
who
we
are
that
is
what
makes
us
the
united
states
of
america
and
we
have
now
just
enshrined
as
soon
as
sign
this
bill
the
core
principle
that
everybody
should
have
some
basic
security
when
it
comes
to
their
health
care
and
it
is
an
extraordinary
achievement
that
has
happened
because
of
all
of
you
and
all
the
advocates
all
across
the
country
so
thank
you
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
thank
you
thank
you
all
right
would
now
like
to
call
up
to
stage
some
of
the
members
of
congress
who
helped
make
this
day
possible
and
some
of
the
americans
who
will
benefit
from
these
reforms
and
going
to
sign
this
bill
this
is
going
to
take
little
while
got
to
use
every
pen
so
going
to
take
really
long
time
practice
we
are
done
good
evening
everybody
tonight
after
nearly
years
of
talk
and
frustration
after
decades
of
trying
and
year
of
sustained
effort
and
debate
the
united
states
congress
finally
declared
that
workers
and
america
families
and
america
small
businesses
deserve
the
security
of
knowing
that
here
in
this
country
neither
illness
nor
accident
should
endanger
the
dreams
worked
lifetime
to
achieve
tonight
at
time
when
the
pundits
said
it
was
no
longer
possible
we
rose
above
the
weight
of
our
politics
we
pushed
back
on
the
undue
influence
of
special
interests
we
did
give
in
to
mistrust
or
to
cynicism
or
to
fear
instead
we
proved
that
we
are
still
people
capable
of
doing
big
things
and
tackling
our
biggest
challenges
we
proved
that
this
government
government
of
the
people
and
by
the
people
still
works
for
the
people
want
to
thank
every
member
of
congress
who
stood
up
tonight
with
courage
and
conviction
to
make
health
care
reform
reality
and
know
this
an
easy
vote
for
lot
of
people
but
it
was
the
right
vote
want
to
thank
speaker
for
her
extraordinary
leadership
and
majority
leader
and
majority
whip
for
their
commitment
to
getting
the
job
done
want
to
thank
my
outstanding
vice
president
and
my
wonderful
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
for
their
fantastic
work
on
this
issue
want
to
thank
the
many
in
congress
and
my
own
incredible
staff
in
the
white
house
who
have
worked
tirelessly
over
the
past
year
with
americans
of
all
walks
of
life
to
forge
reform
package
finally
worthy
of
the
people
we
were
sent
here
to
serve
vote
answers
the
dreams
of
so
many
who
have
fought
for
this
reform
to
every
unsung
american
who
took
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
letter
or
type
out
an
hoping
your
voice
would
be
heard
it
has
been
heard
tonight
to
the
untold
numbers
who
knocked
on
doors
and
made
phone
calls
who
and
out
of
firm
conviction
that
change
in
this
country
comes
not
from
the
top
down
but
from
the
bottom
up
let
me
reaffirm
that
conviction
this
moment
is
possible
because
of
you
most
importantly
vote
answers
the
prayers
of
every
american
who
has
hoped
deeply
for
something
to
be
done
about
health
care
system
that
works
for
insurance
companies
but
not
for
ordinary
people
for
most
americans
this
debate
has
never
been
about
abstractions
the
fight
between
right
and
left
republican
and
democrat
always
been
about
something
far
more
personal
about
every
american
who
knows
the
shock
of
opening
an
envelope
to
see
that
their
premiums
just
shot
up
again
when
times
are
already
tough
enough
about
every
parent
who
knows
the
desperation
of
trying
to
cover
child
with
chronic
illness
only
to
be
told
again
and
again
and
again
about
every
small
business
owner
forced
to
choose
between
insuring
employees
and
staying
open
for
business
they
are
why
we
committed
ourselves
to
this
cause
vote
is
not
victory
for
any
one
party
it
victory
for
them
it
victory
for
the
american
people
and
it
victory
for
common
sense
now
it
probably
goes
without
saying
that
vote
will
give
rise
to
frenzy
of
instant
analysis
there
will
be
tallies
of
washington
winners
and
losers
predictions
about
what
it
means
for
democrats
and
republicans
for
my
poll
numbers
for
my
administration
but
long
after
the
debate
fades
away
and
the
prognostication
fades
away
and
the
dust
settles
what
will
remain
standing
is
not
the
system
some
feared
or
the
status
that
serves
the
interests
of
the
insurance
industry
but
health
care
system
that
incorporates
ideas
from
both
parties
system
that
works
better
for
the
american
people
if
you
have
health
insurance
this
reform
just
gave
you
more
control
by
reining
in
the
worst
excesses
and
abuses
of
the
insurance
industry
with
some
of
the
toughest
consumer
protections
this
country
has
ever
known
so
that
you
are
actually
getting
what
you
pay
for
if
you
have
insurance
this
reform
gives
you
chance
to
be
part
of
big
purchasing
pool
that
will
give
you
choice
and
competition
and
cheaper
prices
for
insurance
and
it
includes
the
largest
health
care
tax
cut
for
working
families
and
small
businesses
in
history
so
that
if
you
lose
your
job
and
you
change
jobs
start
that
new
business
finally
be
able
to
purchase
quality
affordable
care
and
the
security
and
peace
of
mind
that
comes
with
it
this
reform
is
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
seniors
it
makes
stronger
and
more
solvent
extending
its
life
by
almost
decade
and
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
future
it
will
reduce
our
deficit
by
more
than
billion
over
the
next
decade
and
more
than
trillion
in
the
decade
after
that
so
this
radical
reform
but
it
is
major
reform
this
legislation
will
not
fix
everything
that
ails
our
health
care
system
but
it
moves
us
decisively
in
the
right
direction
this
is
what
change
looks
like
now
as
momentous
as
this
day
is
it
not
the
end
of
this
journey
on
tuesday
the
senate
will
take
up
revisions
to
this
legislation
that
the
house
has
embraced
and
these
are
revisions
that
have
strengthened
this
law
and
removed
provisions
that
had
no
place
in
it
some
have
predicted
another
siege
of
parliamentary
in
order
to
delay
adoption
of
these
improvements
hope
not
the
case
time
to
bring
this
debate
to
close
and
begin
the
hard
work
of
implementing
this
reform
properly
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
this
year
and
in
years
to
come
we
have
solemn
responsibility
to
do
it
right
nor
does
this
day
represent
the
end
of
the
work
that
faces
our
country
the
work
of
our
economy
goes
on
the
work
of
promoting
private
sector
job
creation
goes
on
the
work
of
putting
american
dreams
back
within
reach
goes
on
and
we
march
on
with
renewed
confidence
by
this
victory
on
their
behalf
in
the
end
what
this
day
represents
is
another
stone
firmly
laid
in
the
foundation
of
the
american
dream
tonight
we
answered
the
call
of
history
as
so
many
generations
of
americans
have
before
us
when
faced
with
crisis
we
did
not
shrink
from
our
challenge
we
overcame
it
we
did
not
avoid
our
responsibility
we
embraced
it
we
did
not
fear
our
future
we
shaped
it
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
everybody
please
have
set
to
leader
to
john
van
to
an
extraordinary
leader
and
extraordinary
speaker
of
the
house
and
to
all
the
members
here
today
thank
you
very
much
for
having
me
thanks
for
having
me
and
thanks
for
your
tireless
efforts
waged
on
behalf
of
health
insurance
reform
in
this
country
have
the
great
pleasure
of
having
really
nice
library
at
the
white
house
and
was
tooling
through
some
of
the
writings
of
some
previous
presidents
and
came
upon
this
quote
by
abraham
lincoln
am
not
bound
to
win
but
bound
to
be
true
not
bound
to
succeed
but
bound
to
live
up
to
what
light
this
debate
has
been
difficult
debate
this
process
has
been
difficult
process
and
this
year
has
been
difficult
year
for
the
american
people
when
was
sworn
in
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
worst
recession
since
the
great
depression
eight
hundred
thousand
people
per
month
were
losing
their
jobs
millions
of
people
were
losing
their
health
insurance
and
the
financial
system
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
and
this
body
has
taken
on
some
of
the
toughest
votes
and
some
of
the
toughest
decisions
in
the
history
of
congress
not
because
you
were
bound
to
win
but
because
you
were
bound
to
be
true
because
each
and
every
one
of
you
made
decision
that
at
moment
of
such
urgency
it
was
less
important
to
measure
what
the
polls
said
than
to
measure
what
was
right
year
later
in
different
circumstances
because
of
the
actions
that
taken
the
financial
system
has
the
stock
market
has
businesses
are
starting
to
invest
again
the
economy
instead
of
contracting
is
now
growing
again
there
are
signs
that
people
are
going
to
start
hiring
again
still
tremendous
hardship
all
across
the
country
but
there
is
sense
that
we
are
making
progress
because
of
you
but
even
before
this
crisis
each
and
every
one
of
us
knew
that
there
were
millions
of
people
across
america
who
were
living
their
own
quiet
crises
maybe
because
they
had
child
who
had
condition
and
no
matter
how
desperate
they
were
no
matter
what
insurance
company
they
called
they
get
coverage
for
that
child
maybe
it
was
somebody
who
had
been
forced
into
early
retirement
in
their
not
yet
eligible
for
and
they
find
job
and
they
find
health
insurance
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
some
sort
of
chronic
condition
that
had
to
be
tended
to
every
single
one
of
you
at
some
point
before
you
arrived
in
congress
and
after
you
arrived
in
congress
have
met
constituents
with
stories
and
looked
them
in
the
eye
and
said
going
to
do
something
about
it
why
want
to
go
to
congress
and
now
on
the
threshold
of
doing
something
about
it
day
away
after
year
of
debate
after
every
argument
has
been
made
by
just
about
everybody
hours
away
as
some
of
you
know
not
somebody
who
spends
lot
of
time
surfing
the
cable
channels
but
not
completely
in
the
bubble
have
sense
of
what
the
coverage
has
been
and
mostly
an
obsession
with
will
this
mean
for
the
democratic
party
what
will
this
mean
for
the
polls
how
will
this
play
out
in
november
is
this
good
or
is
this
bad
for
the
democratic
majority
what
does
it
mean
for
those
swing
districts
and
noticed
that
been
lot
of
friendly
advice
offered
all
across
town
john
rove
all
warning
you
of
the
horrendous
impact
if
you
support
this
legislation
now
it
could
be
that
they
are
suddenly
having
change
of
heart
and
they
are
deeply
concerned
about
their
democratic
friends
they
are
giving
you
the
best
possible
advice
in
order
to
assure
that
remains
speaker
and
harry
remains
leader
and
that
all
of
you
keep
your
seats
possibility
but
it
may
also
be
possible
that
they
after
health
reform
passes
and
sign
that
legislation
into
law
that
going
to
be
little
harder
to
what
this
effort
has
been
all
about
because
this
year
small
businesses
will
start
getting
tax
credits
so
that
they
can
offer
health
insurance
to
employees
who
currently
have
it
because
this
year
those
same
parents
who
are
worried
about
getting
coverage
for
their
children
with
conditions
now
are
assured
that
insurance
companies
have
to
give
them
coverage
this
year
because
this
year
insurance
companies
suddenly
be
able
to
drop
your
coverage
when
you
get
sick
or
impose
lifetime
limits
or
restrictive
limits
on
the
coverage
that
you
have
maybe
they
know
that
this
year
for
the
first
time
young
people
will
be
able
to
stay
on
their
health
insurance
until
years
old
and
thinking
that
just
might
be
popular
all
across
the
country
and
what
they
also
know
is
what
happen
they
know
that
after
this
legislation
passes
and
after
sign
this
bill
and
behold
nobody
is
pulling
the
plug
on
granny
it
turns
out
that
in
fact
people
who
like
their
health
insurance
are
going
to
be
able
to
keep
their
health
insurance
that
no
government
takeover
people
will
discover
that
if
they
like
their
doctor
be
keeping
their
doctor
in
fact
more
likely
to
keep
their
doctor
because
of
stronger
system
turn
out
that
this
piece
of
historic
legislation
is
built
on
the
private
insurance
system
that
we
have
now
and
runs
straight
down
the
of
american
political
thought
it
turns
out
this
is
bill
that
tracks
the
recommendations
not
just
of
democrat
but
also
republicans
bob
dole
and
baker
that
this
is
bill
that
is
designed
to
help
the
american
people
in
an
area
of
their
lives
where
they
urgently
need
help
now
there
are
some
who
wanted
system
not
this
bill
the
republicans
wanted
what
called
the
guard
the
in
which
we
further
deregulate
the
insurance
companies
and
let
them
run
wild
the
notion
being
somehow
that
that
was
going
to
lower
costs
for
the
american
people
know
serious
health
care
economist
who
buys
that
idea
but
that
was
their
concept
and
we
rejected
that
because
what
we
said
was
we
want
to
create
system
in
which
health
care
is
working
not
for
insurance
companies
but
working
for
the
american
people
working
for
middle
class
families
so
what
did
we
do
what
is
the
essence
of
this
legislation
number
one
this
is
the
toughest
insurance
reforms
in
history
we
are
making
sure
that
the
system
of
private
insurance
works
for
ordinary
families
prescription
this
is
bill
of
rights
on
steroids
so
many
of
you
individually
have
worked
on
these
insurance
reforms
they
are
in
this
package
to
make
sure
that
families
are
getting
fair
deal
that
if
paying
premium
that
getting
good
service
in
return
making
sure
that
employers
if
they
are
paying
premiums
for
their
employees
that
their
employees
are
getting
the
coverage
that
they
expect
that
insurance
companies
are
not
going
to
game
the
system
with
fine
print
and
and
dropping
people
when
they
need
it
most
but
instead
are
going
to
have
to
abide
by
some
basic
rules
of
the
road
that
exemplify
sense
of
fairness
and
good
value
number
one
the
second
thing
this
does
is
it
creates
pool
marketplace
where
individuals
and
small
businesses
who
right
now
are
having
terrible
time
out
there
getting
health
insurance
are
going
to
be
able
to
purchase
health
insurance
as
part
of
big
group
just
like
federal
employees
just
like
members
of
congress
they
are
now
going
to
be
part
of
pool
that
can
negotiate
for
better
rates
better
quality
more
competition
and
why
the
congressional
budget
office
says
this
will
lower
rates
for
comparable
plans
by
to
percent
not
my
numbers
the
congressional
budget
numbers
so
that
people
will
have
choice
and
competition
just
like
members
of
congress
have
choice
and
competition
number
three
if
people
still
afford
it
going
to
provide
them
some
tax
credits
the
biggest
tax
cut
for
small
businesses
and
working
families
when
it
comes
to
health
care
in
history
and
number
four
this
is
the
biggest
reduction
in
our
deficit
since
the
budget
balance
act
one
of
the
biggest
deficit
reduction
measures
in
history
over
trillion
that
will
help
put
us
on
the
path
of
fiscal
responsibility
and
before
we
count
all
the
measures
that
are
going
to
assure
for
example
that
instead
of
having
five
tests
when
you
go
to
the
doctor
you
just
get
one
that
the
delivery
system
is
working
for
patients
not
just
working
for
billings
and
everybody
looked
at
it
says
that
every
single
good
idea
to
bend
the
cost
curve
and
start
actually
reducing
health
care
costs
are
in
this
bill
so
what
this
effort
is
all
about
toughest
insurance
reforms
in
history
marketplace
so
people
have
choice
and
competition
who
right
now
have
it
and
are
seeing
their
premiums
go
up
percent
reductions
in
the
cost
of
health
care
for
millions
of
american
families
including
those
who
have
health
insurance
the
business
did
their
own
study
and
said
that
this
would
potentially
save
employers
per
employee
on
their
health
care
because
of
the
measures
in
this
legislation
and
by
the
way
not
only
does
it
reduce
the
deficit
we
pay
for
it
responsibly
in
ways
that
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
that
talks
lot
about
fiscal
responsibility
but
seem
to
be
able
to
walk
the
walk
claim
when
it
comes
to
their
prescription
drug
bill
we
are
actually
doing
it
this
is
paid
for
and
will
not
add
dime
to
the
deficit
it
will
reduce
the
deficit
now
is
this
bill
perfect
of
course
not
will
this
solve
every
single
problem
in
our
health
care
system
right
away
no
there
are
all
kinds
of
ideas
that
many
of
you
have
that
included
in
this
legislation
know
that
there
has
been
discussion
for
example
of
how
going
to
deal
with
regional
disparities
and
know
that
there
was
meeting
with
secretary
to
assure
that
we
can
continue
to
try
to
make
sure
that
got
system
that
gives
people
the
best
bang
for
their
buck
so
this
is
not
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
that
many
of
you
would
like
to
see
that
in
this
legislation
there
are
some
things
like
to
see
not
in
this
legislation
but
is
this
the
single
most
important
step
that
we
have
taken
on
health
care
since
absolutely
is
this
the
most
important
piece
of
domestic
legislation
in
terms
of
giving
break
to
hardworking
middle
class
families
out
there
since
absolutely
is
this
vast
improvement
over
the
status
absolutely
now
still
know
this
is
tough
vote
though
know
this
is
tough
vote
talked
to
many
of
you
individually
and
have
to
say
that
if
you
honestly
believe
in
your
heart
of
hearts
in
your
conscience
that
this
is
not
an
improvement
over
the
status
if
despite
all
the
information
out
there
that
says
that
without
serious
reform
efforts
like
this
one
premiums
are
going
to
double
over
the
next
five
or
years
that
folks
are
going
to
keep
on
getting
letters
from
their
insurance
companies
saying
that
their
premium
just
went
up
or
percent
if
you
think
that
somehow
okay
that
we
have
millions
of
hardworking
americans
who
get
health
care
and
that
all
right
acceptable
in
the
wealthiest
nation
on
earth
that
there
are
children
with
chronic
illnesses
that
get
the
care
that
they
need
if
you
think
that
the
system
is
working
for
ordinary
americans
rather
than
the
insurance
companies
then
you
should
vote
no
on
this
bill
if
you
can
honestly
say
that
then
you
support
it
here
to
represent
your
constituencies
and
if
you
think
your
constituencies
honestly
be
helped
you
vote
for
this
but
if
you
agree
that
the
system
is
not
working
for
ordinary
families
if
heard
the
same
stories
that
heard
everywhere
all
across
the
country
then
help
us
fix
this
system
do
do
it
for
me
do
it
for
or
harry
do
it
for
all
those
people
out
there
who
are
struggling
some
of
you
know
get
letters
day
that
read
out
of
the
that
we
receive
started
reading
some
of
the
ones
that
got
this
morning
president
my
daughter
wonderful
person
lost
her
job
she
has
no
health
insurance
she
had
blood
clot
in
her
brain
now
disabled
get
president
yet
qualify
for
cobra
is
about
to
run
out
am
desperate
do
know
what
to
do
it
for
them
do
it
for
people
who
are
really
scared
right
now
through
no
fault
of
their
own
played
by
the
rules
done
all
the
right
things
and
have
suddenly
found
out
that
because
of
an
accident
because
of
an
ailment
about
to
lose
their
house
or
they
provide
the
help
to
their
kids
that
they
need
or
small
business
who
up
until
now
has
always
taken
pride
in
providing
care
for
their
workers
and
it
turns
out
that
they
just
afford
to
do
it
anymore
and
having
to
make
decision
about
do
keep
providing
health
insurance
for
my
workers
or
do
just
drop
their
coverage
or
do
not
hire
some
people
because
simply
afford
it
all
being
gobbled
up
by
the
insurance
companies
do
it
for
me
do
it
for
the
democratic
party
do
it
for
the
american
people
the
ones
who
are
looking
for
action
right
now
know
this
is
tough
vote
and
am
actually
confident
talked
to
some
of
you
individually
that
it
will
end
up
being
the
smart
thing
to
do
politically
because
believe
that
good
policy
is
good
politics
am
convinced
that
when
you
go
out
there
and
you
are
standing
tall
and
you
are
saying
believe
that
this
is
the
right
thing
to
do
for
my
constituents
and
the
right
thing
to
do
for
america
that
ultimately
the
truth
will
out
had
wonderful
conversation
with
do
know
if
is
around
here
there
she
is
right
there
is
in
tough
district
the
biggest
newspaper
is
somewhat
conservative
as
described
they
real
happy
with
health
care
reform
they
were
opposed
to
it
despite
the
pressure
announced
that
she
was
in
of
this
bill
and
and
behold
the
next
day
that
same
newspaper
runs
an
editorial
saying
you
know
what
considered
this
looked
at
the
legislation
and
we
actually
are
pleased
that
is
supporting
the
legislation
when
see
john
stand
up
proud
with
whole
bunch
of
his
constituencies
in
as
tough
district
as
there
is
and
stand
up
with
bunch
of
folks
from
his
district
with
conditions
and
saying
you
know
know
what
is
going
on
washington
but
know
going
on
with
these
families
look
at
him
with
pride
now
guarantee
that
this
is
good
politics
every
one
of
you
know
your
districts
better
than
do
you
talk
to
folks
under
enormous
pressure
getting
getting
that
are
tying
up
the
communications
system
know
the
pressure
under
get
few
comments
made
about
me
know
if
noticed
been
in
your
shoes
know
what
like
to
take
tough
vote
but
what
did
lincoln
say
am
not
bound
to
win
but
am
bound
to
be
two
generations
ago
folks
who
were
sitting
in
your
position
they
made
decision
we
are
going
to
make
sure
that
seniors
and
the
poor
have
health
care
coverage
that
they
can
count
on
and
they
did
the
right
thing
and
sure
at
the
time
they
were
making
that
vote
they
sure
how
the
politics
were
either
any
more
than
the
people
who
made
the
decision
to
make
sure
that
social
security
was
in
place
knew
how
the
politics
would
play
out
or
folks
who
passed
the
civil
rights
acts
knew
how
the
politics
were
going
to
play
out
they
were
not
bound
to
win
but
they
were
bound
to
be
true
and
now
got
middle
class
americans
have
have
watching
the
system
fray
along
the
edges
or
being
caught
in
terrible
situations
and
the
question
is
are
we
going
to
be
true
to
them
sometimes
think
about
how
got
involved
in
politics
think
of
myself
as
potential
politician
when
get
out
of
college
went
to
work
in
working
with
catholic
churches
in
poor
in
chicago
trying
to
figure
out
how
people
could
get
little
bit
of
help
and
was
about
politics
and
politicians
just
like
lot
of
americans
are
about
politics
and
politicians
are
right
now
because
my
working
assumption
was
when
push
comes
to
shove
all
too
often
folks
in
elected
office
looking
for
themselves
and
not
looking
out
for
the
folks
who
put
them
there
that
there
are
too
many
compromises
that
the
special
interests
have
too
much
power
they
just
got
too
much
clout
too
much
big
money
washing
around
and
decided
finally
to
get
involved
because
if
willing
to
step
up
and
be
true
to
the
things
believe
in
then
the
system
change
every
single
one
of
you
had
that
same
kind
of
moment
at
the
beginning
of
your
careers
maybe
it
was
just
listening
to
stories
in
your
about
what
was
happening
to
people
been
laid
off
of
work
maybe
it
was
your
own
family
experience
somebody
got
sick
and
have
health
care
and
you
said
something
should
change
something
inspired
you
to
get
involved
and
something
inspired
you
to
be
democrat
instead
of
running
as
republican
because
somewhere
deep
in
your
heart
you
said
to
yourself
believe
in
an
america
in
which
we
just
look
out
for
ourselves
that
we
just
tell
people
on
your
own
that
we
are
proud
of
our
individualism
we
are
proud
of
our
liberty
but
we
also
have
sense
of
and
sense
of
community
and
we
are
willing
to
look
out
for
one
another
and
help
people
who
are
vulnerable
and
help
people
who
are
down
on
their
luck
and
give
them
pathway
to
success
and
give
them
ladder
into
the
middle
class
why
you
decided
to
run
and
now
lot
of
us
have
been
here
while
and
everybody
here
has
taken
their
lumps
and
their
bruises
and
it
turns
out
people
have
had
to
make
compromises
and
been
away
from
families
for
long
time
and
missed
special
events
for
your
kids
sometimes
and
maybe
there
have
been
times
where
you
asked
yourself
why
did
ever
get
involved
in
politics
in
the
first
place
and
maybe
things
change
after
all
and
when
you
do
something
courageous
it
turns
out
sometimes
you
may
be
attacked
and
sometimes
the
very
people
you
thought
you
were
trying
to
help
may
be
angry
at
you
and
shout
at
you
and
you
say
to
yourself
maybe
that
thing
that
started
with
has
been
lost
but
you
know
what
every
once
in
while
every
once
in
while
moment
comes
where
you
have
chance
to
vindicate
all
those
best
hopes
that
you
had
about
yourself
about
this
country
where
you
have
chance
to
make
good
on
those
promises
that
you
made
in
all
those
town
meetings
and
all
those
constituency
breakfasts
and
all
that
through
the
district
all
those
people
who
you
looked
in
the
eye
and
you
said
you
know
what
right
the
system
is
not
working
for
you
and
going
to
make
it
little
bit
better
and
this
is
one
of
those
moments
this
is
one
of
those
times
where
you
can
honestly
say
to
yourself
it
this
is
exactly
why
came
here
this
is
why
got
into
politics
this
is
why
got
into
public
service
this
is
why
made
those
sacrifices
because
believe
so
deeply
in
this
country
and
believe
so
deeply
in
this
democracy
and
willing
to
stand
up
even
when
hard
even
when
tough
every
single
one
of
you
have
made
that
promise
not
just
to
your
constituents
but
to
yourself
and
this
is
the
time
to
make
true
on
that
promise
we
are
not
bound
to
win
but
we
are
bound
to
be
true
we
are
not
bound
to
succeed
but
we
are
bound
to
let
whatever
light
we
have
shine
we
have
been
debating
health
care
for
decades
it
has
now
been
debated
for
year
it
is
in
your
hands
it
is
time
to
pass
health
care
reform
for
america
and
am
confident
that
you
are
going
to
do
it
tomorrow
thank
you
very
much
house
of
representatives
get
this
done
hello
george
mason
everybody
doing
today
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
audience
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
the
president
thank
you
everybody
good
to
be
back
with
some
real
patriots
want
to
thank
the
president
of
george
mason
university
and
his
family
here
thank
you
and
coach
we
were
just
talking
little
bit
about
looking
forward
to
picking
george
mason
in
my
bracket
next
year
audience
member
we
love
you
the
president
love
you
know
if
some
of
you
remember
but
visited
this
university
about
three
years
ago
for
the
first
time
this
was
at
just
the
dawn
of
my
presidential
campaign
it
was
about
three
weeks
old
think
we
have
lot
of
money
we
have
lot
of
staff
nobody
could
pronounce
my
name
our
poll
numbers
were
quite
low
and
lot
of
people
lot
of
people
in
washington
they
think
it
was
even
worth
us
trying
audience
member
yes
we
can
the
president
they
had
counted
us
out
before
we
had
even
started
because
the
washington
conventional
wisdom
was
that
change
was
too
hard
but
what
we
had
even
then
was
group
of
students
here
at
george
mason
who
believed
that
if
we
worked
hard
enough
and
if
we
fought
long
enough
if
we
enough
supporters
then
we
could
finally
bring
change
to
that
city
across
the
river
we
believed
that
despite
all
the
resistance
we
could
make
washington
work
not
for
the
lobbyists
not
for
the
special
interests
not
for
the
politicians
but
for
the
american
people
and
now
three
years
later
stand
before
you
one
year
after
the
worst
recession
since
the
great
depression
having
to
make
bunch
of
tough
decisions
having
had
tumultuous
debate
having
had
lot
of
folks
who
were
that
we
could
get
anything
done
and
right
now
we
are
at
the
point
where
we
are
going
to
do
something
historic
this
weekend
what
this
health
care
vote
is
all
about
audience
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
the
president
few
miles
from
here
congress
is
in
the
final
stages
of
fateful
debate
about
the
future
of
health
insurance
in
america
debate
raged
not
just
for
the
past
year
but
for
the
past
century
one
thing
when
in
the
white
house
got
lot
of
history
books
around
you
and
so
been
reading
up
on
the
history
here
teddy
republican
was
the
first
to
advocate
that
everybody
get
health
care
in
this
country
every
decade
since
had
presidents
republicans
and
democrats
from
harry
to
nixon
to
to
to
every
single
president
has
said
we
need
to
fix
this
system
debate
not
only
about
the
cost
of
health
care
not
just
about
what
doing
about
folks
who
getting
fair
shake
from
their
insurance
companies
debate
about
the
character
of
our
country
about
whether
we
can
still
meet
the
challenges
of
our
time
whether
we
still
have
the
guts
and
the
courage
to
give
every
citizen
not
just
some
the
chance
to
reach
their
dreams
at
the
heart
of
this
debate
is
the
question
of
whether
going
to
accept
system
that
works
better
for
the
insurance
companies
than
it
does
for
the
american
people
because
if
this
vote
fails
the
insurance
industry
will
continue
to
run
amok
they
will
continue
to
deny
people
coverage
they
will
continue
to
deny
people
care
they
will
continue
to
jack
up
premiums
or
or
percent
as
they
have
in
the
last
few
weeks
without
any
accountability
whatsoever
they
know
this
and
why
their
lobbyists
are
stalking
the
halls
of
congress
as
we
speak
and
pouring
millions
of
dollars
into
negative
and
why
they
are
doing
everything
they
can
to
kill
this
bill
so
the
only
question
left
is
this
are
we
going
to
let
the
special
interests
win
once
again
audience
no
the
president
or
are
we
going
to
make
this
vote
victory
for
the
american
people
audience
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
the
president
george
mason
the
time
for
reform
is
right
now
not
year
from
now
not
five
years
from
now
not
years
from
now
not
years
from
now
now
we
have
had
we
have
had
year
of
hard
debate
every
proposal
has
been
put
on
the
table
every
argument
has
been
made
we
have
incorporated
the
best
ideas
from
democrats
and
from
republicans
into
final
proposal
that
builds
on
the
system
of
private
insurance
that
we
currently
have
the
insurance
industry
and
its
supporters
in
congress
have
tried
to
portray
this
as
radical
change
now
just
just
want
to
be
clear
everybody
listen
up
because
we
have
heard
every
crazy
thing
about
this
bill
you
remember
first
we
heard
this
was
government
takeover
of
health
care
then
we
heard
that
this
was
going
to
kill
granny
then
we
heard
well
illegal
immigrants
are
going
to
be
getting
the
main
benefits
of
this
bill
there
has
been
they
have
thrown
every
argument
at
this
legislative
effort
but
when
it
it
turns
out
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
talking
about
is
reform
all
talking
about
if
you
like
your
doctor
going
to
be
able
to
keep
your
doctor
if
you
like
your
plan
keep
your
plan
believe
we
should
give
government
or
the
insurance
companies
more
control
over
health
care
in
america
think
time
to
give
you
the
american
people
more
control
over
your
health
and
since
been
hearing
whole
bunch
of
nonsense
just
be
clear
on
what
exactly
the
proposal
that
going
to
vote
on
in
couple
of
days
will
do
going
to
going
to
change
health
care
in
three
ways
number
one
we
are
going
to
end
the
worst
practices
of
insurance
companies
this
is
this
is
bill
of
rights
on
steroids
starting
this
year
thousands
of
uninsured
americans
with
conditions
will
be
able
to
purchase
health
insurance
some
for
the
very
first
time
starting
this
year
insurance
companies
will
be
banned
forever
from
denying
coverage
to
children
with
conditions
starting
this
year
insurance
companies
will
be
banned
from
dropping
your
coverage
when
you
get
sick
and
been
spending
lot
of
time
weeding
out
people
who
are
sick
so
they
have
to
pay
benefits
that
people
have
already
paid
for
those
practices
will
end
if
this
reform
becomes
law
all
new
insurance
plans
will
be
required
to
offer
free
preventive
care
to
their
customers
if
you
buy
new
plan
there
be
lifetime
or
restrictive
annual
limits
on
the
amount
of
care
you
receive
from
your
insurance
companies
and
by
the
way
to
all
the
young
people
here
today
starting
this
year
if
you
have
insurance
all
new
plans
will
allow
you
to
stay
on
your
plan
until
you
are
years
old
so
have
some
security
when
you
graduate
if
that
first
job
offer
coverage
going
to
know
that
got
coverage
because
as
you
start
your
lives
and
your
careers
the
last
thing
you
should
be
worried
about
is
whether
going
to
go
broke
or
make
your
parents
broke
just
because
you
get
sick
all
right
so
the
first
thing
this
legislation
does
the
toughest
insurance
reforms
in
history
and
by
the
way
when
you
talk
to
republicans
and
you
say
well
are
you
against
this
lot
of
them
will
say
no
no
that
okay
all
right
so
go
to
the
second
part
the
second
thing
that
would
change
about
the
current
system
is
that
for
the
first
time
small
business
owners
and
people
who
are
being
priced
out
of
the
insurance
market
will
have
the
same
kind
of
choice
of
private
health
insurance
that
members
of
congress
give
to
themselves
so
what
this
means
is
is
that
small
business
owners
and
families
going
to
be
able
to
be
part
of
called
big
pool
of
customers
that
can
negotiate
with
the
insurance
companies
and
that
means
they
can
purchase
more
affordable
coverage
in
competitive
marketplace
so
not
out
there
on
their
own
just
shopping
part
of
millions
of
people
who
are
shopping
together
and
if
you
still
afford
the
insurance
in
this
new
marketplace
even
though
going
to
be
cheaper
than
what
you
can
get
on
your
own
then
going
to
offer
you
tax
credits
to
help
you
afford
it
tax
credits
that
add
up
to
the
largest
tax
cut
for
health
care
in
american
history
now
these
tax
credits
cost
money
helping
folks
who
afford
it
right
now
that
does
cost
some
money
it
costs
about
billion
per
year
but
most
of
the
cost
audience
member
all
right
the
president
well
the
reason
all
right
the
reason
all
right
it
be
all
right
if
we
paying
for
it
and
by
the
way
that
what
previous
congress
did
with
the
prescription
drug
plan
all
they
did
was
they
gave
the
benefits
and
they
pay
for
it
that
not
what
doing
what
doing
is
taking
money
that
america
is
already
spending
in
the
health
care
system
but
is
being
spent
poorly
that
going
to
waste
and
fraud
and
unwarranted
subsidies
for
the
insurance
companies
and
taking
that
money
and
making
sure
those
dollars
go
towards
making
insurance
more
affordable
so
going
to
eliminate
wasteful
taxpayer
subsidies
to
insurance
companies
going
to
set
new
fee
on
insurance
companies
that
stand
to
gain
millions
of
new
customers
so
the
point
this
proposal
is
paid
for
unlike
some
of
these
previous
schemes
in
washington
not
taking
out
the
credit
card
in
your
name
young
people
and
charging
it
to
you
making
sure
this
thing
is
paid
for
all
right
so
that
the
second
thing
now
the
third
thing
that
this
legislation
does
is
it
brings
down
the
cost
of
health
care
for
families
and
businesses
and
the
federal
government
americans
who
are
buying
comparable
coverage
in
the
individual
market
would
end
up
seeing
their
premiums
go
down
to
percent
americans
who
get
their
insurance
through
the
workplace
cost
savings
could
be
as
much
as
less
per
employer
than
if
we
do
nothing
now
think
about
that
your
employer
have
to
pay
which
means
maybe
she
can
afford
to
give
you
raise
and
by
the
way
if
curious
well
how
exactly
are
we
saving
these
costs
well
part
of
it
is
again
not
spending
our
health
care
money
wisely
so
for
example
you
go
to
the
hospital
or
you
go
to
doctor
and
you
may
take
five
tests
when
it
turns
out
if
you
just
took
one
test
then
you
send
an
around
with
the
test
results
you
be
paying
per
test
so
trying
to
save
money
across
the
system
and
altogether
our
measures
would
reduce
most
premiums
and
the
bonus
it
brings
down
our
deficit
by
more
than
trillion
over
the
next
two
decades
so
got
got
whole
bunch
of
opponents
of
this
bill
saying
well
we
afford
this
fiscal
conservatives
these
are
the
same
guys
who
passed
that
prescription
drug
bill
without
paying
for
it
adding
over
trillion
to
our
deficit
we
afford
but
this
bill
according
to
the
congressional
budget
office
which
is
the
referee
the
for
how
much
things
cost
says
save
us
trillion
not
only
can
we
afford
to
do
this
we
afford
not
to
do
this
so
the
bottom
line
our
proposal
toughest
insurance
reforms
in
history
one
of
the
biggest
plans
in
history
and
the
opportunity
to
give
millions
of
people
some
of
them
in
your
own
family
some
of
the
people
who
are
in
this
auditorium
today
an
opportunity
for
the
first
time
in
very
long
time
to
get
affordable
health
care
it
what
trying
to
do
what
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
about
to
vote
on
this
weekend
now
it
would
be
nice
if
we
were
just
kind
of
examining
the
substance
we
were
walking
through
the
details
of
the
plan
what
it
means
for
you
but
not
what
the
cable
stations
like
to
talk
about
what
they
like
to
talk
about
is
the
politics
of
the
vote
what
does
this
mean
in
november
what
does
it
mean
to
the
poll
numbers
is
this
more
of
an
advantage
for
democrats
or
republicans
it
going
to
mean
for
will
his
presidency
be
crippled
or
will
he
be
the
comeback
kid
what
they
like
to
talk
about
what
they
like
to
talk
about
understand
one
of
the
things
you
is
basically
that
lot
of
reporting
in
washington
just
like
considered
sport
and
up
and
down
and
keeping
score
and
you
got
the
teams
going
at
it
rock
sock
robots
look
let
me
say
this
george
mason
know
how
this
plays
politically
nobody
really
does
mean
been
so
much
misinformation
and
so
much
confusion
and
the
climate
at
times
during
the
course
of
this
year
has
been
so
toxic
and
people
are
so
anxious
because
the
economy
has
been
going
through
such
tough
time
know
going
to
happen
with
the
politics
on
this
thing
know
whether
my
poll
numbers
go
down
they
go
up
know
what
happens
in
terms
of
democrats
versus
republicans
but
what
do
know
do
know
that
this
bill
this
legislation
is
going
to
be
enormously
important
for
future
do
know
the
impact
it
will
have
on
the
millions
of
americans
who
need
our
help
and
the
millions
more
who
may
not
need
help
right
now
but
year
from
now
or
five
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
if
they
have
some
bad
luck
if
heaven
forbid
they
get
sick
if
got
condition
if
their
child
has
condition
if
they
lose
their
job
if
they
want
to
start
company
know
the
impact
it
will
have
on
them
know
what
this
reform
will
mean
for
people
like
banks
single
mom
met
in
trying
to
put
her
daughter
through
college
just
like
probably
some
of
your
moms
and
dads
are
trying
to
put
you
through
college
and
her
insurance
company
just
sent
her
letter
saying
they
plan
to
double
her
premium
this
year
have
it
go
up
percent
and
she
afford
it
so
now
trying
to
figure
out
am
going
to
keep
my
insurance
or
am
going
to
keep
my
daughter
in
college
banks
needs
us
to
pass
this
reform
bill
know
what
reform
will
mean
for
people
like
met
up
in
green
bay
while
was
campaigning
she
thought
she
had
beaten
her
breast
cancer
then
she
discovered
it
had
spread
to
her
bones
and
she
and
her
insurance
she
and
her
husband
they
were
lucky
enough
to
have
insurance
but
their
medical
bills
still
landed
them
in
debt
so
now
spending
time
worrying
about
the
debt
when
all
she
wants
to
do
is
think
about
how
she
can
spend
time
with
her
two
kids
needs
us
to
pass
this
reform
bill
know
what
reform
will
mean
for
people
like
when
her
insurance
company
raised
her
rates
she
had
to
give
up
her
coverage
even
though
she
had
been
paying
thousands
of
dollars
in
premiums
for
years
because
she
had
beaten
cancer
years
earlier
they
kept
on
jacking
up
her
rates
jacking
up
her
rates
finally
she
thought
she
was
going
to
lose
her
home
she
was
scared
that
sudden
illness
would
lead
to
financial
ruin
but
she
had
no
choice
right
now
lying
in
hospital
bed
faced
with
paying
for
such
an
illness
after
she
had
to
give
up
her
health
insurance
praying
that
somehow
she
can
afford
to
get
well
she
knows
that
it
is
time
for
reform
so
george
mason
when
you
hear
people
saying
well
why
do
we
do
this
more
incrementally
why
do
we
do
this
little
more
piecemeal
why
do
we
just
help
the
folks
that
are
easiest
to
help
my
answer
is
the
time
for
reform
is
now
we
have
waited
long
enough
we
have
waited
long
enough
and
in
just
few
days
struggle
will
culminate
in
historic
vote
had
historic
votes
before
we
had
historic
vote
to
put
social
security
in
place
to
make
sure
that
our
elderly
did
not
live
out
their
golden
years
in
poverty
we
had
historic
vote
in
civil
rights
to
make
sure
that
everybody
was
equal
under
the
law
as
messy
as
this
process
is
as
frustrating
as
this
process
is
as
ugly
as
this
process
can
be
when
we
have
faced
such
decisions
in
our
past
this
nation
time
and
time
again
has
chosen
to
extend
its
promise
to
more
of
its
people
you
know
the
said
that
social
security
would
lead
to
socialism
but
the
men
and
women
of
congress
stood
fast
and
created
that
program
that
lifted
millions
out
of
poverty
there
were
cynics
that
warned
that
would
lead
to
government
takeover
of
our
entire
health
care
system
and
that
it
have
much
support
in
the
polls
but
democrats
and
republicans
refused
to
back
down
and
they
made
sure
that
our
seniors
had
the
health
care
that
they
needed
and
could
have
some
basic
peace
of
mind
so
previous
generations
those
who
came
before
us
made
the
decision
that
our
seniors
and
our
poor
through
should
not
be
forced
to
go
without
health
care
just
because
they
afford
it
today
it
falls
to
this
generation
to
decide
whether
we
will
make
that
same
promise
to
hardworking
families
and
small
businesses
all
across
america
and
to
young
americans
like
yourselves
who
are
just
starting
out
so
my
bottom
line
know
this
has
been
difficult
journey
know
this
will
be
tough
vote
know
that
everybody
is
counting
votes
right
now
in
washington
but
also
remember
quote
saw
on
plaque
in
the
white
house
the
other
day
hanging
in
the
same
room
where
demanded
answers
from
insurance
executives
and
just
received
bunch
of
excuses
and
it
was
quote
from
teddy
the
person
who
first
called
for
health
care
reform
that
republican
all
those
years
ago
and
it
said
fighting
for
the
right
is
the
noblest
sport
the
world
now
know
how
passing
health
care
will
play
politically
but
know
right
teddy
knew
it
was
right
harry
knew
that
it
was
right
ted
kennedy
knew
it
was
right
and
if
you
believe
that
right
then
you
got
to
help
us
finish
this
fight
you
got
to
stand
with
me
just
like
you
did
three
years
ago
and
make
some
phone
calls
and
knock
on
some
doors
talk
to
your
parents
talk
to
your
friends
do
not
quit
do
not
give
up
we
keep
on
going
we
are
going
to
get
this
done
we
are
going
to
make
history
we
are
going
to
fix
health
care
in
america
with
your
help
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
lost
in
the
news
of
the
week
was
headline
that
ought
to
be
source
of
concern
for
every
american
it
said
nations
passing
in
now
debates
in
washington
tend
to
be
consumed
with
the
politics
of
the
moment
up
in
the
daily
polls
whose
party
stands
to
gain
in
november
but
what
matters
to
you
what
matters
to
our
country
is
not
what
happens
in
the
next
election
but
what
we
do
to
lift
up
the
next
generation
and
the
fact
is
there
are
few
issues
that
speak
more
directly
to
our
long
term
success
as
nation
than
issues
concerning
the
education
we
provide
to
our
children
our
prosperity
in
the
century
was
by
an
education
system
that
helped
grow
the
middle
class
and
unleash
the
talents
of
our
people
more
fully
and
widely
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
we
built
schools
and
focused
on
the
teaching
of
math
and
science
we
helped
generation
of
veterans
go
to
college
through
the
bill
we
led
the
globe
in
producing
college
graduates
and
in
turn
we
led
in
producing
technologies
and
scientific
discoveries
that
lifted
living
standards
and
set
us
apart
as
the
engine
of
innovation
of
course
other
nations
this
and
are
looking
to
gain
an
edge
in
the
global
marketplace
by
investing
in
better
schools
supporting
teachers
and
committing
to
clear
standards
that
will
produce
graduates
with
more
skills
our
competitors
understand
that
the
nation
that
us
today
will
us
tomorrow
yet
too
often
we
have
failed
to
make
inroads
in
reforming
and
strengthening
our
public
education
system
the
debate
mired
in
worn
arguments
hurled
across
entrenched
divides
as
result
over
the
last
few
decades
lost
ground
one
assessment
shows
american
fifteen
year
no
longer
even
near
the
top
in
math
and
science
when
compared
to
their
peers
around
the
world
as
referenced
in
the
news
report
mentioned
now
fallen
behind
most
wealthy
countries
in
our
high
school
graduation
rates
and
while
we
once
led
the
world
in
the
proportion
of
college
graduates
we
produced
today
we
no
longer
do
not
only
does
that
risk
our
leadership
as
nation
it
consigns
millions
of
americans
to
lesser
future
for
we
know
that
the
level
of
education
person
attains
is
increasingly
for
success
and
predictor
of
the
income
that
person
will
earn
throughout
his
or
her
life
beyond
the
economic
statistics
is
less
tangible
but
no
less
painful
reality
unless
we
take
action
unless
we
step
up
there
are
countless
children
who
will
never
their
full
talent
and
potential
accept
that
future
for
them
and
accept
that
future
for
the
united
states
of
america
why
engaged
in
historic
effort
to
redeem
and
improve
our
public
schools
to
raise
the
expectations
for
our
students
and
for
ourselves
to
and
reward
excellence
to
improve
performance
in
troubled
schools
and
to
give
our
kids
and
our
country
the
best
chance
to
succeed
in
changing
world
under
the
leadership
of
an
outstanding
education
secretary
we
launched
race
to
the
top
through
which
states
compete
for
funding
by
committing
to
reform
and
raising
standards
by
rewarding
good
teaching
by
supporting
the
development
of
better
assessments
to
measure
results
and
by
math
and
science
to
help
prepare
children
for
college
and
careers
and
on
monday
my
administration
will
send
to
congress
our
blueprint
for
an
updated
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
to
overhaul
no
child
left
behind
what
this
plan
is
that
while
the
federal
government
can
play
leading
role
in
encouraging
the
reforms
and
high
standards
we
need
the
impetus
for
that
change
will
come
from
states
and
from
local
schools
and
school
districts
so
yes
we
set
high
bar
but
we
also
provide
educators
the
flexibility
to
reach
it
under
these
guidelines
schools
that
achieve
excellence
or
show
real
progress
will
be
rewarded
and
local
districts
will
be
encouraged
to
commit
to
change
in
schools
that
are
clearly
letting
their
students
down
for
the
majority
of
schools
that
fall
in
between
schools
that
do
well
but
could
do
better
we
will
encourage
continuous
improvement
to
help
keep
our
young
people
on
track
for
bright
future
prepared
for
the
jobs
of
the
century
and
because
the
most
important
factor
in
success
is
the
person
standing
at
the
front
of
the
classroom
we
will
better
prepare
teachers
support
teachers
and
encourage
teachers
to
stay
in
the
field
in
short
treat
the
people
who
educate
our
sons
and
daughters
like
the
professionals
they
are
through
this
plan
we
are
setting
an
ambitious
goal
all
students
should
graduate
from
high
school
prepared
for
college
and
career
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
achieving
this
goal
will
be
difficult
it
will
take
time
and
it
will
require
the
skills
talents
and
dedication
of
many
principals
teachers
parents
students
but
this
effort
is
essential
for
our
children
and
for
our
country
and
while
there
will
always
be
those
cynics
who
claim
it
be
done
at
our
best
we
know
that
america
has
always
risen
to
the
challenges
that
faced
this
challenge
is
no
different
as
nation
we
are
engaged
in
many
important
improving
the
economy
reforming
the
health
care
system
encouraging
innovation
in
energy
and
other
growth
industries
of
the
century
but
our
success
in
these
efforts
and
our
success
in
the
future
as
people
will
ultimately
depend
on
what
happens
long
before
an
entrepreneur
opens
his
doors
or
nurse
walks
the
rounds
or
scientist
steps
into
her
laboratory
our
future
is
determined
each
and
every
day
when
our
children
enter
the
classroom
ready
to
learn
and
brimming
with
promise
that
promise
we
must
help
them
thank
you
please
everybody
have
seat
thank
you
for
the
wonderful
introduction
david
and
thank
you
for
the
great
work
that
you
are
doing
each
and
every
day
and
appreciate
such
warm
welcome
some
of
you
gotten
chance
to
know
many
of
you
meeting
for
the
first
time
but
the
spirit
of
the
hispanic
chamber
of
commerce
the
desire
to
create
jobs
and
provide
opportunity
to
people
who
sometimes
have
been
left
out
that
exactly
what
this
administration
is
about
that
the
essence
of
the
american
dream
and
so
very
proud
to
have
chance
to
speak
with
all
of
you
you
know
every
so
often
throughout
our
history
generation
of
americans
bears
the
responsibility
of
seeing
this
country
through
difficult
times
and
protecting
the
dream
of
its
founding
for
posterity
this
is
responsibility
that
fallen
to
our
generation
meeting
it
will
require
steering
our
nation
economy
through
crisis
unlike
anything
that
we
have
seen
in
our
time
in
the
short
term
that
means
job
creation
and
restarting
lending
and
restoring
confidence
in
our
markets
and
our
financial
system
but
it
also
means
taking
steps
that
not
only
advance
our
recovery
but
lay
the
foundation
for
lasting
shared
prosperity
know
there
some
who
believe
we
can
only
handle
one
challenge
at
time
and
they
forget
that
lincoln
helped
lay
down
the
transcontinental
railroad
and
passed
the
homestead
act
and
created
the
national
academy
of
sciences
in
the
midst
of
civil
war
likewise
president
did
have
the
luxury
of
choosing
between
ending
depression
and
fighting
war
he
had
to
do
both
president
kennedy
did
have
the
luxury
of
choosing
between
civil
rights
and
sending
us
to
the
moon
and
we
do
have
the
luxury
of
choosing
between
getting
our
economy
moving
now
and
rebuilding
it
over
the
long
term
america
will
not
remain
true
to
its
highest
ideals
and
america
place
as
global
economic
leader
will
be
put
at
risk
unless
we
not
only
bring
down
the
crushing
cost
of
health
care
and
transform
the
way
we
use
energy
but
also
if
we
do
if
we
do
do
far
better
job
than
we
been
doing
of
educating
our
sons
and
daughters
unless
we
give
them
the
knowledge
and
skills
they
need
in
this
new
and
changing
world
for
we
know
that
economic
progress
and
educational
achievement
have
always
gone
hand
in
hand
in
america
the
colleges
and
public
high
schools
transformed
the
economy
of
an
nation
the
bill
generated
middle
class
that
made
america
economy
in
the
century
investments
in
math
and
science
under
president
gave
new
opportunities
to
young
scientists
and
engineers
all
across
the
country
it
made
possible
somebody
like
to
attend
graduate
school
and
found
an
upstart
company
called
that
would
forever
change
our
world
the
source
of
america
prosperity
has
never
been
merely
how
ably
we
accumulate
wealth
but
how
well
we
educate
our
people
this
has
never
been
more
true
than
it
is
today
in
world
where
jobs
can
be
shipped
wherever
there
an
internet
connection
where
child
born
in
dallas
is
now
competing
with
child
in
new
delhi
where
your
best
job
qualification
is
not
what
you
do
but
what
you
know
education
is
no
longer
just
pathway
to
opportunity
and
success
it
for
success
that
why
workers
without
degree
have
borne
the
brunt
of
recent
layoffs
most
of
all
that
why
of
the
fastest
growing
occupations
in
america
half
require
bachelor
degree
or
more
by
four
out
of
every
new
jobs
will
require
at
least
some
advanced
education
or
training
so
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
future
belongs
to
the
nation
that
best
educates
its
citizens
and
my
fellow
americans
we
have
everything
we
need
to
be
that
nation
we
have
the
best
universities
the
most
renowned
scholars
we
have
innovative
principals
and
passionate
teachers
and
gifted
students
and
we
have
parents
whose
only
priority
is
their
child
education
we
have
legacy
of
excellence
and
an
unwavering
belief
that
our
children
should
climb
higher
than
we
did
and
yet
despite
resources
that
are
unmatched
anywhere
in
the
world
we
let
our
grades
slip
our
schools
crumble
our
teacher
quality
fall
short
and
other
nations
outpace
us
let
me
give
you
few
statistics
in
grade
math
we
fallen
to
place
outperform
ours
three
to
one
just
third
of
our
and
can
read
as
well
as
they
should
and
year
after
year
stubborn
gap
persists
between
how
well
white
students
are
doing
compared
to
their
african
american
and
latino
classmates
the
relative
decline
of
american
education
is
untenable
for
our
economy
it
unsustainable
for
our
democracy
it
unacceptable
for
our
children
and
we
afford
to
let
it
continue
what
at
stake
is
nothing
less
than
the
american
dream
it
what
drew
my
father
and
so
many
of
your
fathers
and
mothers
to
our
shores
in
pursuit
of
an
education
it
what
led
brown
and
and
to
bear
the
standard
of
all
who
were
attending
separate
and
unequal
schools
it
what
has
led
generations
of
americans
to
take
on
that
extra
job
to
sacrifice
the
small
pleasures
to
and
save
wherever
they
can
in
hopes
of
putting
away
enough
just
enough
to
give
their
child
the
education
that
they
never
had
it
that
most
american
of
ideas
that
with
the
right
education
child
of
any
race
any
faith
any
station
can
overcome
whatever
barriers
stand
in
their
way
and
their
potential
of
course
we
heard
all
this
year
after
year
after
year
after
year
and
far
too
little
has
changed
certainly
it
has
changed
in
too
many
overcrowded
latino
schools
it
has
changed
in
too
many
schools
that
are
seeing
dropout
rates
of
over
percent
it
not
changing
not
because
we
lacking
sound
ideas
or
sensible
plans
in
pockets
of
excellence
across
this
country
we
seeing
what
children
from
all
walks
of
life
can
and
will
achieve
when
we
set
high
standards
have
high
expectations
when
we
do
good
job
of
preparing
them
instead
it
because
politics
and
ideology
have
too
often
trumped
our
progress
that
we
in
the
situation
that
we
in
for
decades
washington
has
been
trapped
in
the
same
stale
debates
that
have
progress
and
perpetuated
our
educational
decline
too
many
supporters
of
my
party
have
resisted
the
idea
of
rewarding
excellence
in
teaching
with
extra
pay
even
though
we
know
it
can
make
difference
in
the
classroom
too
many
in
the
republican
party
have
opposed
new
investments
in
early
education
despite
compelling
evidence
of
its
importance
so
what
we
get
here
in
washington
is
the
same
old
debate
about
it
more
money
versus
more
reform
vouchers
versus
the
status
there
been
partisanship
and
petty
bickering
but
little
recognition
that
we
need
to
move
beyond
the
worn
fights
of
the
century
if
we
going
to
succeed
in
the
century
think
you
all
agree
that
the
time
for
is
over
the
time
for
holding
us
holding
ourselves
accountable
is
here
what
required
is
not
simply
new
investments
but
new
reforms
it
time
to
expect
more
from
our
students
it
time
to
start
rewarding
good
teachers
stop
making
excuses
for
bad
ones
it
time
to
demand
results
from
government
at
every
level
it
time
to
prepare
every
child
everywhere
in
america
to
any
worker
anywhere
in
the
world
it
time
to
give
all
americans
complete
and
competitive
education
from
the
cradle
up
through
career
we
accepted
failure
for
far
too
long
enough
is
enough
america
entire
education
system
must
once
more
be
the
envy
of
the
world
and
that
exactly
what
we
intend
to
do
that
exactly
what
the
budget
submitting
to
congress
has
begun
to
achieve
now
at
time
when
we
inherited
deficit
we
will
start
by
doing
little
housekeeping
going
through
our
books
cutting
wasteful
education
programs
my
outstanding
secretary
of
education
who
here
today
stand
up
so
everybody
can
see
you
assuming
you
also
saw
my
secretary
of
but
secretary
will
use
only
one
test
when
deciding
what
ideas
to
support
with
your
precious
tax
dollars
it
not
whether
an
idea
is
liberal
or
conservative
but
whether
it
works
and
this
will
help
free
up
resources
for
the
first
pillar
of
reforming
our
schools
investing
in
early
childhood
initiatives
this
is
just
about
keeping
an
eye
on
our
children
it
about
educating
them
studies
show
that
children
in
early
childhood
education
programs
are
more
likely
to
score
higher
in
reading
and
math
more
likely
to
graduate
from
high
school
and
attend
college
more
likely
to
hold
job
and
more
likely
to
earn
more
in
that
job
for
every
dollar
we
invest
in
these
programs
we
get
nearly
back
in
reduced
welfare
rolls
fewer
health
care
costs
and
less
crime
that
why
the
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
act
that
signed
into
law
invests
billion
in
growing
early
head
start
and
head
start
expanding
access
to
quality
child
care
for
more
children
from
working
families
and
doing
more
for
children
with
special
needs
and
that
why
we
are
going
to
offer
parents
regular
visits
from
trained
nurses
to
help
make
sure
their
children
are
healthy
and
prepare
them
for
school
and
for
life
even
as
we
invest
in
early
childhood
education
let
raise
the
bar
for
early
learning
programs
that
are
falling
short
now
today
some
children
are
enrolled
in
excellent
programs
some
children
are
enrolled
in
mediocre
programs
and
some
are
wasting
away
their
most
formative
years
in
bad
programs
that
includes
the
of
all
children
who
are
hispanic
and
who
will
drive
america
workforce
of
tomorrow
but
who
are
less
likely
to
have
been
enrolled
in
an
early
childhood
education
program
than
anyone
else
that
why
issuing
challenge
to
our
states
develop
plan
to
raise
the
quality
of
your
early
learning
programs
show
us
how
you
work
to
ensure
that
children
are
better
prepared
for
success
by
the
time
they
enter
kindergarten
if
you
do
we
will
support
you
with
an
early
learning
challenge
grant
that
call
on
congress
to
enact
that
how
we
will
reward
quality
and
excellence
and
make
down
payment
on
the
success
of
the
next
generation
so
that
the
first
pillar
of
our
education
reform
agenda
the
second
we
will
end
what
has
become
race
to
the
bottom
in
our
schools
and
instead
spur
race
to
the
top
by
encouraging
better
standards
and
assessments
now
this
is
an
area
where
we
are
being
outpaced
by
other
nations
it
not
that
their
kids
are
any
smarter
than
ours
it
that
they
are
being
smarter
about
how
to
educate
their
children
they
spending
less
time
teaching
things
that
do
matter
and
more
time
teaching
things
that
do
they
preparing
their
students
not
only
for
high
school
or
college
but
for
career
we
are
not
our
curriculum
for
graders
is
two
full
years
behind
top
performing
countries
that
prescription
for
economic
decline
and
refuse
to
accept
that
america
children
can
not
rise
to
this
challenge
they
can
and
they
must
and
they
will
meet
higher
standards
in
our
time
so
let
challenge
our
states
let
challenge
our
states
to
adopt
standards
that
will
bring
our
to
the
century
today
system
of
different
sets
of
benchmarks
for
academic
success
means
grade
readers
in
are
scoring
nearly
points
lower
than
students
in
and
they
getting
the
same
grade
eight
of
our
states
are
setting
their
standards
so
low
that
their
students
may
end
up
on
par
with
roughly
the
bottom
percent
of
the
world
that
inexcusable
that
why
calling
on
states
that
are
setting
their
standards
far
below
where
they
ought
to
be
to
stop
expectations
for
our
kids
the
solution
to
low
test
scores
is
not
lowering
standards
it
tougher
clearer
standards
standards
like
those
in
where
graders
are
we
have
contingent
here
in
graders
are
now
tying
for
first
first
in
the
whole
world
in
science
other
states
are
moving
in
the
same
direction
by
coming
together
as
part
of
consortium
and
more
states
need
to
do
the
same
and
calling
on
our
nation
governors
and
state
education
chiefs
to
develop
standards
and
assessments
that
do
simply
measure
whether
students
can
fill
in
bubble
on
test
but
whether
they
possess
century
skills
like
and
critical
thinking
and
entrepreneurship
and
creativity
that
is
what
we
help
them
do
later
this
year
that
what
we
going
to
help
them
do
later
this
year
when
we
finally
make
no
child
left
behind
live
up
to
its
name
by
ensuring
not
only
that
teachers
and
principals
get
the
funding
that
they
need
but
that
the
money
is
tied
to
results
and
will
also
back
up
this
commitment
to
higher
standards
with
fund
to
invest
in
innovation
in
our
school
districts
of
course
raising
standards
alone
will
not
make
much
of
difference
unless
we
provide
teachers
and
principals
with
the
information
they
need
to
make
sure
students
are
prepared
to
meet
those
standards
and
far
too
few
states
have
data
systems
like
the
one
in
florida
that
keep
track
of
student
education
from
childhood
through
college
and
far
too
few
districts
are
emulating
the
example
of
houston
and
long
beach
and
using
data
to
track
how
much
progress
student
is
making
and
where
that
student
is
struggling
that
resource
that
can
help
us
improve
student
achievement
and
tell
us
which
students
had
which
teachers
so
we
can
assess
what
working
and
what
not
that
why
we
making
major
investment
in
this
area
that
we
will
cultivate
new
culture
of
accountability
in
america
schools
now
to
complete
our
race
to
the
top
requires
the
third
pillar
of
reform
recruiting
preparing
and
rewarding
outstanding
teachers
from
the
moment
students
enter
school
the
most
important
factor
in
their
success
is
not
the
of
their
skin
or
the
income
of
their
parents
it
the
person
standing
at
the
front
of
the
classroom
that
why
our
recovery
act
will
ensure
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
teachers
and
school
personnel
are
not
laid
off
because
those
americans
are
not
only
doing
jobs
they
afford
to
lose
they
rendering
service
our
nation
can
not
afford
to
lose
either
america
future
depends
on
its
teachers
and
so
today
calling
on
new
generation
of
americans
to
step
forward
and
serve
our
country
in
our
classrooms
if
you
want
to
make
difference
in
the
life
of
our
nation
if
you
want
to
make
the
most
of
your
talents
and
dedication
if
you
want
to
make
your
mark
with
legacy
that
will
endure
then
join
the
teaching
profession
america
needs
you
we
need
you
in
our
suburbs
we
need
you
in
our
small
towns
we
especially
need
you
in
our
inner
cities
we
need
you
in
classrooms
all
across
our
country
and
if
you
do
your
part
then
we
do
ours
that
why
we
taking
steps
to
prepare
teachers
for
their
difficult
responsibilities
and
encourage
them
to
stay
in
the
profession
that
why
we
creating
new
pathways
to
teaching
and
new
incentives
to
bring
teachers
to
schools
where
they
needed
most
that
why
we
support
offering
extra
pay
to
americans
who
teach
math
and
science
to
end
teacher
shortage
in
those
subjects
it
why
we
building
on
the
promising
work
being
done
in
places
like
south
teachers
advancement
program
and
making
an
unprecedented
commitment
to
ensure
that
anyone
entrusted
with
educating
our
children
is
doing
the
job
as
well
as
it
can
be
done
now
here
what
that
commitment
means
it
means
treating
teachers
like
the
professionals
they
are
while
also
holding
them
more
accountable
in
up
to
more
school
districts
new
teachers
will
be
by
experienced
ones
good
teachers
will
be
rewarded
with
more
money
for
improved
student
achievement
and
asked
to
accept
more
responsibilities
for
lifting
up
their
schools
teachers
throughout
school
will
benefit
from
guidance
and
support
to
help
them
improve
and
just
as
we
given
our
teachers
all
the
support
they
need
to
be
successful
we
need
to
make
sure
our
students
have
the
teacher
they
need
to
be
successful
and
that
means
states
and
school
districts
taking
steps
to
move
bad
teachers
out
of
the
classroom
but
let
me
be
clear
let
me
be
clear
the
overwhelming
number
of
teachers
are
doing
an
outstanding
job
under
difficult
circumstances
my
sister
is
teacher
so
know
how
tough
teaching
can
be
but
let
me
be
clear
if
teacher
is
given
chance
or
two
chances
or
three
chances
but
still
does
not
improve
there
no
excuse
for
that
person
to
continue
teaching
reject
system
that
rewards
failure
and
protects
person
from
its
consequences
the
stakes
are
too
high
we
can
afford
nothing
but
the
best
when
it
comes
to
our
children
teachers
and
the
schools
where
they
teach
now
that
leads
me
to
the
fourth
part
of
america
education
strategy
promoting
innovation
and
excellence
in
america
schools
one
of
the
places
where
much
of
that
innovation
occurs
is
in
our
most
effective
charter
schools
and
these
are
public
schools
founded
by
parents
teachers
and
civic
or
community
with
broad
leeway
to
innovate
schools
supported
as
state
legislator
and
united
states
senator
but
right
now
there
are
many
caps
on
how
many
charter
schools
are
allowed
in
some
states
no
matter
how
well
they
preparing
our
students
that
is
good
for
our
children
our
economy
or
our
country
of
course
any
expansion
of
charter
schools
must
not
result
in
the
spread
of
mediocrity
but
in
the
advancement
of
excellence
and
that
will
require
states
adopting
both
rigorous
selection
and
review
process
to
ensure
that
charter
school
autonomy
is
coupled
with
greater
accountability
as
well
as
strategy
like
the
one
in
chicago
to
close
charter
schools
that
are
not
working
provided
this
greater
accountability
call
on
states
to
reform
their
charter
rules
and
lift
caps
on
the
number
of
allowable
charter
schools
wherever
such
caps
are
in
place
now
even
as
we
foster
innovation
in
where
our
children
are
learning
let
also
foster
innovation
in
when
our
children
are
learning
we
can
no
longer
afford
an
academic
calendar
designed
for
when
america
was
nation
of
farmers
who
needed
their
children
at
home
the
land
at
the
end
of
each
day
that
calendar
may
have
once
made
sense
but
today
it
puts
us
at
competitive
disadvantage
our
children
listen
to
this
our
children
spend
over
month
less
in
school
than
children
in
south
korea
every
year
that
no
way
to
prepare
them
for
century
economy
that
why
calling
for
us
not
only
to
expand
effective
programs
but
to
rethink
the
school
day
to
incorporate
more
time
whether
during
the
summer
or
through
programs
for
children
who
need
it
now
know
longer
school
days
and
school
years
are
not
wildly
popular
ideas
not
with
and
not
in
my
family
and
probably
not
in
yours
but
the
challenges
of
new
century
demand
more
time
in
the
classroom
if
they
can
do
that
in
south
korea
we
can
do
it
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
of
course
no
matter
how
innovative
our
schools
or
how
effective
our
teachers
america
can
not
succeed
unless
our
students
take
responsibility
for
their
own
education
that
means
showing
up
for
school
on
time
paying
attention
in
class
seeking
out
extra
tutoring
if
it
needed
staying
out
of
trouble
to
any
student
who
watching
say
this
do
even
think
about
dropping
out
of
school
do
even
think
about
it
as
said
couple
of
weeks
ago
dropping
out
is
quitting
on
yourself
it
quitting
on
your
country
and
it
not
an
option
not
anymore
not
when
our
high
school
dropout
rate
has
tripled
in
the
past
years
not
when
high
school
dropouts
earn
about
half
as
much
as
college
graduates
not
when
latino
students
are
dropping
out
faster
than
just
about
anyone
else
it
time
for
all
of
us
no
matter
what
our
backgrounds
to
come
together
and
solve
this
epidemic
stemming
the
tide
of
dropouts
will
require
turning
around
our
schools
just
high
schools
in
cities
like
detroit
and
and
produce
over
percent
of
america
dropouts
and
yet
there
are
too
few
proven
strategies
to
transform
these
schools
and
there
are
too
few
partners
to
get
the
job
done
so
today
issuing
challenge
to
educators
and
lawmakers
parents
and
teachers
alike
let
us
all
make
turning
around
our
schools
our
collective
responsibility
as
americans
and
that
will
require
new
investments
in
innovative
ideas
that
why
my
budget
invests
in
developing
new
strategies
to
make
sure
students
do
give
up
on
their
education
new
efforts
to
give
dropouts
who
want
to
return
to
school
the
help
they
need
to
graduate
and
new
ways
to
put
those
young
men
and
women
who
have
left
school
back
on
pathway
to
graduation
now
the
fifth
part
of
america
education
strategy
is
providing
every
american
with
quality
higher
education
whether
it
college
or
technical
training
never
has
college
degree
been
more
important
never
has
it
been
more
expensive
and
at
time
when
so
many
of
our
families
are
bearing
enormous
economic
burdens
the
rising
cost
of
tuition
threatens
to
shatter
dreams
and
that
why
we
will
simplify
federal
college
assistance
forms
so
it
does
take
to
apply
for
financial
aid
that
why
we
already
taking
steps
to
make
college
or
technical
training
affordable
for
the
first
time
ever
grants
will
not
be
subject
to
the
politics
of
the
moment
or
the
whim
of
the
market
they
will
be
commitment
that
congress
is
required
to
uphold
each
and
every
year
not
only
that
because
rising
costs
mean
grants
cover
less
than
half
as
much
tuition
as
they
did
years
ago
we
raising
the
maximum
grant
to
year
and
indexing
it
above
inflation
we
also
providing
tuition
tax
credit
for
students
from
working
families
and
we
and
expanding
the
loan
program
to
make
sure
schools
like
do
get
tenth
as
many
loans
as
schools
like
harvard
to
help
pay
for
all
of
this
we
putting
students
ahead
of
lenders
by
eliminating
wasteful
student
loan
subsidies
that
cost
taxpayers
billions
each
year
all
in
all
we
are
making
college
affordable
for
million
more
students
with
sweeping
investment
in
our
children
futures
and
america
success
and
call
on
congress
to
join
me
and
the
american
people
by
making
these
investments
possible
this
is
how
we
will
help
meet
our
responsibility
as
nation
to
open
the
doors
of
college
to
every
american
but
it
will
also
be
the
responsibility
of
colleges
and
universities
to
control
costs
we
just
keep
on
putting
more
money
in
and
universities
and
colleges
not
doing
their
part
to
hold
down
and
it
the
responsibility
of
our
students
to
walk
through
the
doors
of
opportunity
in
just
single
generation
america
has
fallen
from
place
to
place
in
the
portion
of
students
completing
college
that
is
unfortunate
but
it
by
no
means
irreversible
with
resolve
and
the
right
investments
we
can
retake
the
lead
once
more
and
that
why
in
my
address
to
the
nation
the
other
week
called
on
americans
to
commit
to
at
least
one
year
or
more
of
higher
education
or
career
training
with
the
goal
of
having
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
by
the
year
and
to
meet
that
goal
we
are
investing
billion
to
identify
and
support
innovative
initiatives
across
the
country
that
achieve
results
in
helping
students
persist
and
graduate
so
let
not
stop
at
education
with
college
let
century
reality
learning
does
end
in
our
early
adults
of
all
ages
need
opportunities
to
earn
new
degrees
and
new
skills
especially
in
the
current
economic
environment
that
means
working
with
all
our
universities
and
schools
including
community
colleges
great
and
undervalued
asset
to
prepare
workers
for
good
jobs
in
industries
and
to
improve
access
to
job
training
not
only
for
young
people
who
are
just
starting
their
careers
but
for
older
workers
who
need
new
skills
to
change
careers
and
that
going
to
be
one
of
the
key
tasks
that
secretary
is
involved
with
is
making
sure
that
lifelong
learning
is
reality
and
possibility
for
more
americans
it
through
initiatives
like
these
that
we
see
more
americans
earn
college
degree
or
receive
advanced
training
and
pursue
successful
career
and
that
why
calling
on
congress
to
work
with
me
to
enact
these
essential
reforms
and
to
the
workforce
reinvestment
act
that
how
we
will
round
out
complete
and
competitive
education
in
the
united
states
of
america
so
here
the
bottom
line
yes
we
need
more
money
yes
we
need
more
reform
yes
we
need
to
hold
ourselves
more
accountable
for
every
dollar
we
spend
but
there
one
more
ingredient
want
to
talk
about
no
government
policy
will
make
any
difference
unless
we
also
hold
ourselves
more
accountable
as
parents
because
government
no
matter
how
wise
or
efficient
can
not
turn
off
the
or
put
away
the
video
games
teachers
no
matter
how
dedicated
or
effective
can
not
make
sure
your
child
leaves
for
school
on
time
and
does
their
homework
when
they
get
back
at
night
these
are
things
only
parent
can
do
these
are
things
that
our
parents
must
do
say
this
not
only
as
father
but
also
as
son
when
was
child
my
mother
and
lived
overseas
and
she
did
have
the
money
to
send
me
to
the
fancy
international
school
where
all
the
american
kids
went
to
school
so
what
she
did
was
she
supplemented
my
schooling
with
lessons
from
correspondence
course
and
can
still
picture
her
waking
me
up
at
five
days
week
to
go
over
some
lessons
before
went
to
school
and
whenever
complain
and
grumble
and
find
some
excuse
and
say
sleepy
she
patiently
repeat
to
me
her
most
powerful
she
say
this
is
no
picnic
for
me
either
and
when
you
kid
you
do
think
about
the
sacrifices
they
making
she
had
to
work
just
had
to
go
to
school
but
she
still
wake
up
every
day
to
make
sure
was
getting
what
needed
for
my
education
and
it
because
she
did
this
day
after
day
week
after
week
because
of
all
the
other
opportunities
and
breaks
that
got
along
the
way
all
the
sacrifices
that
my
grandmother
and
my
grandfather
made
along
the
way
that
can
stand
here
today
as
president
of
the
united
states
it
because
of
the
sacrifices
see
want
every
child
in
this
country
to
have
the
same
chance
that
my
mother
gave
me
that
my
teachers
gave
me
that
my
college
professors
gave
me
that
america
gave
me
you
know
these
stories
you
lived
them
as
well
all
of
you
have
similar
story
to
tell
you
know
it
want
children
like
to
have
that
chance
is
student
at
village
academy
high
school
in
california
now
village
academy
is
century
school
where
cutting
edge
technologies
are
used
in
the
classroom
where
college
prep
and
career
training
are
offered
to
all
who
seek
it
and
where
the
motto
is
respect
responsibility
and
results
now
couple
of
months
ago
and
her
class
made
video
talking
about
the
impact
that
our
struggling
economy
was
having
on
their
lives
and
some
of
them
spoke
about
their
parents
being
laid
off
or
their
homes
facing
foreclosure
or
their
inability
to
focus
on
school
with
everything
that
was
happening
at
home
and
when
it
was
her
turn
to
speak
said
we
all
been
affected
by
this
economic
crisis
we
are
all
college
bound
students
we
all
businessmen
and
doctors
and
lawyers
and
all
this
great
stuff
and
we
have
all
this
potential
but
the
way
things
are
going
we
not
going
to
be
able
to
it
it
was
heartbreaking
that
girl
so
full
of
promise
was
so
full
of
worry
that
she
and
her
class
titled
their
video
is
anybody
listening
so
today
there
something
want
to
say
to
and
her
class
at
village
academy
am
listening
we
are
listening
america
is
listening
and
we
will
not
rest
until
your
parents
can
keep
your
jobs
we
will
not
rest
until
your
parents
can
keep
their
jobs
and
your
families
can
keep
their
homes
and
you
can
focus
on
what
you
should
be
focusing
on
your
own
education
until
you
can
become
the
businessmen
doctors
and
lawyers
of
tomorrow
until
you
can
reach
out
and
grasp
your
dreams
for
the
future
for
in
the
end
dream
is
dream
shared
by
all
americans
it
the
founding
promise
of
our
nation
that
we
can
make
of
our
lives
what
we
will
that
all
things
are
possible
for
all
people
and
that
here
in
america
our
best
days
lie
ahead
believe
that
truly
believe
if
do
my
part
and
you
the
american
people
do
yours
then
we
will
emerge
from
this
crisis
stronger
nation
and
pass
the
dream
of
our
founding
on
to
posterity
ever
safer
than

thank
you
very
much
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
all
of
you
for
joining
us
today
and
want
to
thank
and
standing
behind
me
physicians
physicians
assistants
and
nurses
who
understand
how
important
it
is
for
us
to
make
much
needed
changes
in
our
health
care
system
want
to
thank
all
of
you
who
are
here
today
want
to
specially
two
people
who
have
been
working
tirelessly
on
that
on
this
effort
my
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
as
well
as
our
quarterback
for
health
reform
out
of
the
white
house
we
began
our
push
to
reform
health
insurance
last
march
in
this
room
with
doctors
and
nurses
who
know
the
system
best
and
so
fitting
to
be
joined
by
all
of
you
as
we
bring
this
journey
to
close
last
thursday
spent
seven
hours
at
summit
where
democrats
and
republicans
engaged
in
public
and
very
substantive
discussion
about
health
care
this
meeting
capped
off
debate
that
began
with
similar
summit
nearly
one
year
ago
and
since
then
every
idea
has
been
put
on
the
table
every
argument
has
been
made
everything
there
is
to
say
about
health
care
has
been
said
and
just
about
everybody
has
said
it
so
now
is
the
time
to
make
decision
about
how
to
finally
reform
health
care
so
that
it
works
not
just
for
the
insurance
companies
but
for
families
and
businesses
now
where
both
sides
say
they
agree
is
that
the
status
is
not
working
for
the
american
people
health
insurance
is
becoming
more
expensive
by
the
day
families
afford
it
businesses
afford
it
the
federal
government
afford
it
smaller
businesses
and
individuals
who
get
coverage
at
work
are
squeezed
especially
hard
and
insurance
companies
freely
ration
health
care
based
on
sick
and
healthy
who
can
pay
and
who
that
the
status
that
the
system
we
have
right
now
democrats
and
republicans
agree
that
this
is
serious
problem
for
america
and
we
agree
that
if
we
do
nothing
if
we
throw
up
our
hands
and
walk
away
problem
that
will
only
grow
worse
nobody
disputes
that
more
americans
will
lose
their
family
health
insurance
if
they
switch
jobs
or
lose
their
job
more
small
businesses
will
be
forced
to
choose
between
health
care
and
hiring
more
insurance
companies
will
deny
people
coverage
who
have
conditions
or
they
drop
people
coverage
when
they
get
sick
and
need
it
most
and
the
rising
cost
of
and
will
sink
our
government
deeper
and
deeper
and
deeper
into
debt
on
all
of
this
we
agree
so
the
question
is
what
do
we
do
about
it
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
there
are
some
who
suggested
scrapping
our
system
of
private
insurance
and
replacing
it
with
health
care
system
and
though
many
other
countries
have
such
system
in
america
it
would
be
neither
practical
nor
realistic
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
there
are
those
and
this
includes
most
republicans
in
congress
who
believe
the
answer
is
to
loosen
regulations
on
the
insurance
industry
whether
it
state
consumer
protections
or
minimum
standards
for
the
kind
of
insurance
they
can
sell
the
argument
is
is
that
that
will
somehow
lower
costs
disagree
with
that
approach
concerned
that
this
would
only
give
the
insurance
industry
even
freer
rein
to
raise
premiums
and
deny
care
so
do
believe
we
should
give
government
bureaucrats
or
insurance
company
bureaucrats
more
control
over
health
care
in
america
believe
it
time
to
give
the
american
people
more
control
over
their
health
care
and
their
health
insurance
do
believe
we
can
afford
to
leave
decisions
about
health
care
to
the
discretion
of
insurance
company
executives
alone
believe
that
doctors
and
nurses
and
physician
assistants
like
the
ones
in
this
room
should
be
free
to
decide
what
best
for
their
patients
now
the
proposal
put
forward
gives
americans
more
control
over
their
health
insurance
and
their
health
care
by
holding
insurance
companies
more
accountable
it
builds
on
the
current
system
where
most
americans
get
their
health
insurance
from
their
employer
if
you
like
your
plan
you
can
keep
your
plan
if
you
like
your
doctor
you
can
keep
your
doctor
can
tell
you
as
the
father
of
two
young
girls
would
not
want
any
plan
that
interferes
with
the
relationship
between
family
and
their
doctor
essentially
my
proposal
would
change
three
things
about
the
current
health
care
system
first
it
would
end
the
worst
practices
of
insurance
companies
no
longer
would
they
be
able
to
deny
your
coverage
because
of
condition
no
longer
would
they
be
able
to
drop
your
coverage
because
you
got
sick
no
longer
would
they
be
able
to
force
you
to
pay
unlimited
amounts
of
money
out
of
your
own
pocket
no
longer
would
they
be
able
to
arbitrarily
and
massively
raise
premiums
like
anthem
blue
cross
recently
tried
to
do
in
california
up
to
percent
increases
in
one
year
in
the
individual
market
those
practices
would
end
second
my
proposal
would
give
uninsured
individuals
and
small
business
owners
the
same
kind
of
choice
of
private
health
insurance
that
members
of
congress
get
for
themselves
because
if
good
enough
for
members
of
congress
good
enough
for
the
people
who
pay
their
salaries
the
reason
federal
employees
get
good
deal
on
health
insurance
is
that
we
all
participate
in
an
insurance
market
where
insurance
companies
give
better
coverage
and
better
rates
because
they
get
more
customers
it
an
idea
that
many
republicans
have
embraced
in
the
past
before
politics
intruded
and
my
proposal
says
that
if
you
still
afford
the
insurance
in
this
new
marketplace
even
though
it
going
to
provide
better
deals
for
people
than
they
can
get
right
now
in
the
individual
marketplace
then
we
offer
you
tax
credits
to
do
so
tax
credits
that
add
up
to
the
largest
tax
cut
for
health
care
in
history
after
all
the
wealthiest
among
us
can
already
buy
the
best
insurance
there
is
and
the
least
well
off
are
able
to
get
coverage
through
so
it
the
middle
class
that
gets
squeezed
and
who
we
have
to
help
now
it
is
absolutely
true
that
all
of
this
will
cost
some
money
about
billion
per
year
but
most
of
this
comes
from
the
nearly
trillion
year
that
america
already
spends
on
health
care
but
lot
of
it
is
not
spent
wisely
lot
of
that
money
is
being
wasted
or
spent
badly
so
within
this
plan
going
to
make
sure
the
dollars
we
spend
go
towards
making
insurance
more
affordable
and
more
secure
going
to
eliminate
wasteful
taxpayer
subsidies
that
currently
go
to
insurance
and
pharmaceutical
companies
set
new
fee
on
insurance
companies
that
stand
to
gain
lot
of
money
and
lot
of
profits
as
millions
of
americans
are
able
to
buy
insurance
and
we
going
to
make
sure
that
the
wealthiest
americans
pay
their
fair
share
on
the
bottom
line
is
our
proposal
is
paid
for
and
all
the
new
money
generated
in
this
plan
goes
back
to
small
businesses
and
families
who
afford
health
insurance
it
would
also
lower
prescription
drug
prices
for
seniors
and
it
would
help
train
new
doctors
and
nurses
and
physician
assistants
to
provide
care
for
american
families
finally
my
proposal
would
bring
down
the
cost
of
health
care
for
millions
families
businesses
and
the
federal
government
we
have
now
incorporated
most
of
the
serious
ideas
from
across
the
political
spectrum
about
how
to
contain
the
rising
cost
of
health
care
ideas
that
go
after
the
waste
and
abuse
in
our
system
especially
in
programs
like
but
we
do
this
while
protecting
benefits
and
extending
the
financial
stability
of
the
program
by
nearly
decade
our
measures
mirror
most
of
the
proposals
in
the
current
senate
bill
which
reduces
most
people
premiums
and
brings
down
our
deficit
by
up
to
trillion
dollars
over
the
next
two
decades
brings
down
our
deficit
those
are
my
numbers
those
are
the
savings
determined
by
the
congressional
budget
office
which
is
the
washington
acronym
for
the
independent
referee
of
congress
in
terms
of
how
much
stuff
costs
so
that
our
proposal
this
is
where
we
ended
up
it
an
approach
that
has
been
debated
and
changed
and
believe
improved
over
the
last
year
it
incorporates
the
best
ideas
from
democrats
and
republicans
including
some
of
the
ideas
that
republicans
offered
during
the
health
care
summit
like
funding
state
grants
on
medical
malpractice
reform
and
curbing
waste
and
fraud
and
abuse
in
the
health
care
system
my
proposal
also
gets
rid
of
many
of
the
provisions
that
had
no
place
in
health
care
reform
provisions
that
were
more
about
winning
individual
votes
in
congress
than
improving
health
care
for
all
americans
now
despite
all
that
we
agree
on
and
all
the
republican
ideas
we
incorporated
many
probably
most
republicans
in
congress
just
have
fundamental
disagreement
over
whether
we
should
have
more
or
less
oversight
of
insurance
companies
and
if
they
truly
believe
that
less
regulation
would
lead
to
higher
quality
more
affordable
health
insurance
then
they
should
vote
against
the
proposal
put
forward
now
some
also
believe
that
we
should
instead
of
doing
what
proposing
pursue
piecemeal
approach
to
health
insurance
reform
where
we
tinker
around
the
edges
of
this
challenge
for
the
next
few
years
even
those
who
acknowledge
the
problem
of
the
uninsured
say
we
just
afford
to
help
them
right
now
which
is
why
the
republican
proposal
only
covers
million
uninsured
americans
while
we
cover
over
million
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
that
unless
everyone
has
access
to
affordable
coverage
you
prevent
insurance
companies
from
denying
coverage
based
on
conditions
you
limit
the
amount
families
are
forced
to
pay
out
of
their
own
pockets
the
insurance
reforms
rest
on
everybody
having
access
to
coverage
and
you
also
do
do
anything
about
the
fact
that
taxpayers
currently
end
up
the
uninsured
when
they
forced
to
go
to
the
emergency
room
for
care
to
the
tune
of
about
thousand
bucks
per
family
you
get
those
savings
if
those
people
are
still
going
to
the
emergency
room
so
the
fact
is
health
reform
only
works
if
you
take
care
of
all
of
these
problems
at
once
now
both
during
and
after
last
week
summit
republicans
in
congress
insisted
that
the
only
acceptable
course
on
health
care
reform
is
to
start
over
but
given
these
honest
and
substantial
differences
between
the
parties
about
the
need
to
regulate
the
insurance
industry
and
the
need
to
help
millions
of
families
get
insurance
do
see
how
another
year
of
negotiations
would
help
moreover
the
insurance
companies
are
starting
over
they
continuing
to
raise
premiums
and
deny
coverage
as
we
speak
for
us
to
start
over
now
could
simply
lead
to
delay
that
could
last
for
another
decade
or
even
more
the
american
people
and
the
economy
just
wait
that
long
so
no
matter
which
approach
you
believe
the
united
states
congress
owes
the
american
people
final
vote
on
health
care
reform
we
have
debated
this
issue
thoroughly
not
just
for
the
past
year
but
for
decades
reform
has
already
passed
the
house
with
majority
it
has
already
passed
the
senate
with
of
votes
and
now
it
deserves
the
same
kind
of
up
or
down
vote
that
was
cast
on
welfare
reform
that
was
cast
on
the
children
health
insurance
program
that
was
used
for
cobra
health
coverage
for
the
unemployed
and
by
the
way
for
both
bush
tax
cuts
all
of
which
had
to
pass
congress
with
nothing
more
than
simple
majority
therefore
ask
leaders
in
both
houses
of
congress
to
finish
their
work
and
schedule
vote
in
the
next
few
weeks
from
now
until
then
will
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
the
case
for
reform
and
urge
every
american
who
wants
this
reform
to
make
their
voice
heard
as
well
every
family
every
business
every
patient
every
doctor
every
nurse
every
assistant
make
your
voice
heard
this
has
been
long
and
wrenching
debate
it
has
stoked
great
passions
among
the
american
people
and
their
representatives
and
that
because
health
care
is
difficult
issue
it
is
complicated
issue
if
it
was
easy
it
would
have
been
solved
long
ago
as
all
of
you
know
from
experience
health
care
can
literally
be
an
issue
of
life
or
death
and
as
result
it
easily
lends
itself
to
demagoguery
and
political
gamesmanship
and
misrepresentation
and
misunderstanding
but
not
an
excuse
for
those
of
us
who
were
sent
here
to
lead
that
not
an
excuse
for
us
to
walk
away
we
just
give
up
because
the
politics
are
hard
know
been
fascination
bordering
on
obsession
in
this
media
town
about
what
passing
health
insurance
reform
would
mean
for
the
next
election
and
the
one
after
that
how
will
this
play
what
will
happen
with
the
polls
will
leave
it
to
others
to
sift
through
the
politics
because
not
what
this
is
about
not
why
here
this
is
about
what
reform
would
mean
for
the
mother
with
breast
cancer
whose
insurance
company
will
finally
have
to
pay
for
her
chemotherapy
this
is
about
what
reform
would
mean
for
the
small
business
owner
who
will
no
longer
have
to
choose
between
hiring
more
workers
or
offering
coverage
to
the
employees
she
has
this
is
about
what
reform
would
mean
for
families
who
will
be
able
to
afford
health
insurance
for
the
very
first
time
in
their
lives
and
get
regular
checkup
once
in
while
and
have
some
security
about
their
children
if
they
get
sick
this
is
about
what
reform
would
mean
for
all
those
men
and
women
met
over
the
last
few
years
been
brave
enough
to
share
their
stories
when
we
started
our
push
for
reform
last
year
talked
to
young
mother
in
named
she
has
two
young
children
she
thought
she
had
beaten
her
breast
cancer
but
then
later
discovered
it
had
spread
to
her
bones
she
and
her
husband
were
working
and
had
insurance
but
their
medical
bills
still
landed
them
in
debt
and
now
she
spends
time
worrying
about
that
debt
when
all
she
wants
to
do
is
spend
time
with
her
children
and
focus
on
getting
well
this
should
not
happen
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
it
have
to
in
the
end
that
what
this
debate
is
about
it
about
what
kind
of
country
we
want
to
be
it
about
the
millions
of
lives
that
would
be
touched
and
in
some
cases
saved
by
making
private
health
insurance
more
secure
and
more
affordable
so
at
stake
right
now
is
not
just
our
ability
to
solve
this
problem
but
our
ability
to
solve
any
problem
the
american
people
want
to
know
if
it
still
possible
for
washington
to
look
out
for
their
interests
and
their
future
they
are
waiting
for
us
to
act
they
are
waiting
for
us
to
lead
and
as
long
as
hold
this
office
intend
to
provide
that
leadership
do
not
know
how
this
plays
politically
but
know
it
right
and
so
ask
congress
to
finish
its
work
and
look
forward
to
signing
this
reform
into
law
thank
you
very
much
everybody
let
get
it
done
thank

thank
you
very
much
please

so
much
heads
of
state
cabinet
members
my
outstanding
vice
president
members
of
congress
religious
leaders
distinguished
guests
admiral
it
good
to
see
all
of
you
let
me
begin
by
acknowledging
the
of
this
breakfast
senators
and
who
embody
the
sense
of
fellowship
at
the
heart
of
this
gathering
they
two
of
my
senators
let
me
also
acknowledge
the
director
of
my
office
joshua
who
is
here
where
joshua
he
out
there
somewhere
he
doing
great
work
want
to
commend
secretary
on
her
outstanding
remarks
and
her
outstanding
leadership
at
the
state
department
she
doing
good
every
day
especially
pleased
to
see
my
dear
friend
prime
minister
and
want
him
to
relay
america
greetings
to
the
people
of
spain
and
you
are
right
deeply
blessed
and
thank
god
every
day
for
being
married
to
privileged
to
join
you
once
again
as
my
predecessors
have
for
over
half
century
like
them
come
here
to
speak
about
the
ways
my
faith
informs
who
am
as
president
and
as
person
but
also
here
for
the
same
reason
that
all
of
you
are
for
we
all
share
recognition
one
as
old
as
time
that
willingness
to
believe
an
openness
to
grace
commitment
to
prayer
can
bring
sustenance
to
our
lives
there
is
of
course
need
for
prayer
even
in
times
of
joy
and
peace
and
prosperity
perhaps
especially
in
such
times
prayer
is
needed
to
guard
against
pride
and
to
guard
against
complacency
but
rightly
or
wrongly
most
of
us
are
inclined
to
seek
out
the
divine
not
in
the
moment
when
the
lord
makes
his
face
shine
upon
us
but
in
moments
when
god
grace
can
seem
farthest
away
last
month
god
grace
god
mercy
seemed
far
away
from
our
in
haiti
and
yet
believe
that
grace
was
not
absent
in
the
midst
of
tragedy
it
was
heard
in
prayers
and
hymns
that
broke
the
silence
of
an
earthquake
wake
it
was
witnessed
among
parishioners
of
churches
that
stood
no
more
roadside
congregation
holding
bibles
in
their
laps
it
was
felt
in
the
presence
of
relief
workers
and
medics
translators
servicemen
and
women
bringing
water
and
food
and
aid
to
the
injured
one
such
translator
was
an
american
of
haitian
descent
representative
of
the
extraordinary
work
that
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
do
all
around
the
world
navy
christian
sic
and
lying
on
aboard
the
comfort
woman
asked
where
do
you
come
from
what
country
after
my
operation
she
said
will
pray
for
that
country
and
in
creole
responded
the
united
states
of
america
god
grace
and
the
compassion
and
decency
of
the
american
people
is
expressed
through
the
men
and
women
like
it
expressed
through
the
efforts
of
our
armed
forces
through
the
efforts
of
our
entire
government
through
similar
efforts
from
spain
and
other
countries
around
the
world
it
also
as
secretary
said
expressed
through
multiple
efforts
by
evangelicals
at
world
relief
by
the
american
jewish
world
service
by
hindu
temples
and
mainline
protestants
catholic
relief
services
african
american
churches
the
united
by
americans
of
every
faith
and
no
faith
uniting
around
common
purpose
higher
purpose
it
inspiring
this
is
what
we
do
as
americans
in
times
of
trouble
we
unite
that
such
crises
call
on
all
of
us
to
act
that
there
but
for
the
grace
of
god
go
that
life
most
sacred
responsibility
one
affirmed
as
said
by
all
of
the
world
great
religions
is
to
sacrifice
something
of
ourselves
for
person
in
need
sadly
though
that
spirit
is
too
often
absent
when
tackling
the
but
no
less
profound
issues
facing
our
country
and
the
world
too
often
that
spirit
is
missing
without
the
spectacular
tragedy
the
or
the
the
earthquake
or
the
tsunami
that
can
shake
us
out
of
complacency
we
become
numb
to
the
crises
the
tragedies
of
children
without
food
and
men
without
shelter
and
families
without
health
care
we
become
absorbed
with
our
abstract
arguments
our
ideological
disputes
our
contests
for
power
and
in
this
tower
of
babel
we
lose
the
sound
of
god
voice
now
for
those
of
us
here
in
washington
let
acknowledge
that
democracy
has
always
been
messy
let
not
be
overly
nostalgic
divisions
are
hardly
new
in
this
country
arguments
about
the
proper
role
of
government
the
relationship
between
liberty
and
equality
our
obligations
to
our
fellow
citizens
these
things
have
been
with
us
since
our
founding
and
profoundly
mindful
that
loyal
opposition
vigorous
back
and
forth
of
power
all
of
that
is
what
makes
our
democracy
work
and
we
seen
actually
some
improvement
in
some
circumstances
we
have
seen
any
canings
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
any
time
recently
so
we
should
the
past
but
there
is
sense
that
something
is
different
now
that
something
is
broken
that
those
of
us
in
washington
are
not
serving
the
people
as
well
as
we
should
at
times
it
seems
like
we
unable
to
listen
to
one
another
to
have
at
once
serious
and
civil
debate
and
this
erosion
of
civility
in
the
public
square
sows
division
and
distrust
among
our
citizens
it
poisons
the
well
of
public
opinion
it
leaves
each
side
little
room
to
negotiate
with
the
other
it
makes
politics
an
sport
where
one
side
is
either
always
right
or
always
wrong
when
in
reality
neither
side
has
monopoly
on
truth
and
then
we
lose
sight
of
the
children
without
food
and
the
men
without
shelter
and
the
families
without
health
care
empowered
by
faith
consistently
prayerfully
we
need
to
find
our
way
back
to
civility
that
begins
with
stepping
out
of
our
comfort
zones
in
an
effort
to
bridge
divisions
we
see
that
in
many
conservative
pastors
who
are
helping
lead
the
way
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
it
not
what
would
be
expected
from
them
and
yet
they
in
those
immigrant
families
the
face
of
god
we
see
that
in
the
evangelical
leaders
who
are
rallying
their
congregations
to
protect
our
planet
we
see
it
in
the
increasing
recognition
among
progressives
that
government
solve
all
of
our
problems
and
that
talking
about
values
like
responsible
fatherhood
and
healthy
marriage
are
integral
to
any
agenda
stretching
out
of
our
dogmas
our
prescribed
roles
along
the
political
spectrum
that
can
help
us
regain
sense
of
civility
civility
also
requires
relearning
how
to
disagree
without
being
disagreeable
understanding
as
president
kennedy
said
that
civility
is
not
sign
of
weakness
now
am
the
first
to
confess
am
not
always
right
will
testify
to
that
but
surely
you
can
question
my
policies
without
questioning
my
faith
or
for
that
matter
my
citizenship
challenging
each
other
ideas
can
renew
our
democracy
but
when
we
challenge
each
other
motives
it
becomes
harder
to
see
what
we
hold
in
common
we
forget
that
we
share
at
some
deep
level
the
same
dreams
even
when
we
do
share
the
same
plans
on
how
to
them
we
may
disagree
about
the
best
way
to
reform
our
health
care
system
but
surely
we
can
agree
that
no
one
ought
to
go
broke
when
they
get
sick
in
the
richest
nation
on
earth
we
can
take
different
approaches
to
ending
inequality
but
surely
we
can
agree
on
the
need
to
lift
our
children
out
of
ignorance
to
lift
our
from
poverty
we
may
disagree
about
gay
marriage
but
surely
we
can
agree
that
it
is
unconscionable
to
target
gays
and
lesbians
for
who
they
are
whether
it
here
in
the
united
states
or
as
mentioned
more
extremely
in
odious
laws
that
are
being
proposed
most
recently
in
uganda
surely
we
can
agree
to
find
common
ground
when
possible
parting
ways
when
necessary
but
in
doing
so
let
us
be
guided
by
our
faith
and
by
prayer
for
while
prayer
can
buck
us
up
when
we
are
down
keep
us
calm
in
storm
while
prayer
can
stiffen
our
spines
to
surmount
an
obstacle
and
assure
you
praying
lot
these
days
prayer
can
also
do
something
else
it
can
touch
our
hearts
with
humility
it
can
fill
us
with
spirit
of
brotherhood
it
can
remind
us
that
each
of
us
are
children
of
awesome
and
loving
god
through
faith
but
not
through
faith
alone
we
can
unite
people
to
serve
the
common
good
and
that
why
my
office
of
and
partnerships
has
been
working
so
hard
since
announced
it
here
last
year
we
slashed
red
tape
and
built
effective
partnerships
on
range
of
uses
from
promoting
fatherhood
here
at
home
to
spearheading
cooperation
abroad
and
through
that
office
we
turned
the
initiative
around
to
find
common
ground
among
people
of
all
beliefs
allowing
them
to
make
an
impact
in
way
that
civil
and
respectful
of
difference
and
focused
on
what
matters
most
it
is
this
spirit
of
civility
that
we
are
called
to
take
up
when
we
leave
here
today
that
what
praying
for
know
in
difficult
times
like
these
when
people
are
frustrated
when
pundits
start
shouting
and
politicians
start
calling
each
other
names
it
can
seem
like
return
to
civility
is
not
possible
like
the
very
idea
is
relic
of
some
bygone
era
the
word
itself
seems
quaint
civility
but
let
us
remember
those
who
came
before
those
who
believed
in
the
brotherhood
of
man
even
when
such
faith
was
tested
remember
martin
luther
king
not
long
after
an
explosion
ripped
through
his
front
porch
his
wife
and
infant
daughter
inside
he
rose
to
that
pulpit
in
and
said
love
is
the
only
force
capable
of
transforming
an
enemy
into
friend
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
denied
his
humanity
he
saw
the
face
of
god
remember
abraham
lincoln
on
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
with
states
seceding
and
forces
gathering
with
nation
divided
half
slave
and
half
free
he
rose
to
deliver
his
first
inaugural
and
said
we
are
not
enemies
but
passion
may
have
strained
it
must
not
break
our
bonds
of
affection
even
in
the
eyes
of
confederate
soldiers
he
saw
the
face
of
god
remember
whose
christian
faith
led
him
to
seek
slavery
abolition
in
britain
he
was
vilified
derided
attacked
but
he
called
for
lessening
prejudices
and
conciliating
and
thereby
making
way
for
the
less
obstructed
progress
of
truth
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
sought
to
silence
nation
conscience
he
saw
the
face
of
god
yes
there
are
crimes
of
conscience
that
call
us
to
action
yes
there
are
causes
that
move
our
hearts
and
that
stir
our
souls
but
progress
does
come
when
we
opponents
it
not
born
in
righteous
spite
progress
comes
when
we
open
our
hearts
when
we
extend
our
hands
when
we
our
common
humanity
progress
comes
when
we
look
into
the
eyes
of
another
and
see
the
face
of
god
that
we
might
do
so
that
we
will
do
so
all
the
time
not
just
some
of
the
time
is
my
fervent
prayer
for
our
nation
and
the
world
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
morning
everybody
this
morning
sent
budget
to
congress
for
the
coming
year
it
budget
that
reflects
the
serious
challenges
facing
the
country
we
at
war
our
economy
has
lost
million
jobs
over
the
last
two
years
and
our
government
is
deeply
in
debt
after
what
can
only
be
described
as
decade
of
profligacy
the
fact
is
years
ago
we
had
budget
surplus
of
more
than
billion
with
projected
surpluses
stretching
out
toward
the
horizon
yet
over
the
course
of
the
past
years
the
previous
administration
and
previous
congresses
created
an
expensive
new
drug
program
passed
massive
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
and
funded
two
wars
without
paying
for
any
of
it
all
of
which
was
compounded
by
recession
and
by
rising
health
care
costs
as
result
when
first
walked
through
the
door
the
deficit
stood
at
trillion
with
projected
deficits
of
trillion
over
the
next
decade
if
we
had
taken
office
during
ordinary
times
we
would
have
started
bringing
down
these
deficits
immediately
but
one
year
ago
our
country
was
in
crisis
we
were
losing
nearly
jobs
each
month
the
economy
was
in
free
fall
and
the
financial
system
was
near
collapse
many
feared
another
great
depression
so
we
initiated
rescue
and
that
rescue
was
not
without
significant
cost
it
added
to
the
deficit
as
well
one
year
later
because
of
the
steps
we
taken
we
in
very
different
place
but
we
simply
move
beyond
this
crisis
we
have
to
address
the
irresponsibility
that
led
to
it
and
that
includes
the
failure
to
rein
in
spending
as
well
reliance
on
borrowing
from
wall
street
to
washington
to
main
street
to
fuel
our
growth
that
what
we
have
to
change
we
have
to
do
what
families
across
america
are
doing
save
where
we
can
so
that
we
can
afford
what
we
need
now
think
it
very
important
to
understand
we
be
able
to
bring
down
this
deficit
overnight
given
that
the
recovery
is
still
taking
hold
and
families
across
the
country
still
need
help
we
will
continue
for
example
to
do
what
it
takes
to
create
jobs
that
reflected
in
my
budget
it
essential
the
budget
includes
new
tax
cuts
for
people
who
invest
in
small
businesses
tax
credits
for
small
businesses
that
hire
new
workers
investments
that
will
create
jobs
repairing
roads
and
bridges
and
tax
breaks
for
retrofitting
homes
to
save
energy
we
also
continue
to
lay
new
foundation
for
lasting
growth
which
is
essential
as
well
just
as
it
would
be
terrible
mistake
to
borrow
against
our
children
future
to
pay
our
way
today
it
would
be
equally
wrong
to
neglect
their
future
by
failing
to
invest
in
areas
that
will
determine
our
economic
success
in
this
new
century
that
why
we
build
on
the
largest
investment
in
clean
energy
in
history
as
well
as
increase
investment
in
scientific
research
so
that
we
are
fostering
the
industries
and
jobs
of
the
future
right
here
in
america
that
why
proposed
more
than
percent
increase
in
funding
for
the
education
department
and
this
funding
is
tied
to
reforms
that
raise
student
achievement
inspire
students
to
excel
in
math
and
science
and
turn
around
failing
schools
which
consign
too
many
young
people
to
lesser
future
because
in
the
century
there
is
no
better
program
than
education
and
that
why
we
eliminate
wasteful
subsidy
to
banks
that
lend
to
college
students
and
use
that
money
to
community
colleges
and
make
college
more
affordable
this
will
help
us
reach
the
goal
set
for
america
by
we
will
once
again
have
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
these
are
the
investments
we
must
make
to
create
jobs
and
opportunity
now
and
in
the
future
and
in
departure
from
the
way
business
had
been
done
in
washington
we
actually
show
how
we
pay
for
these
investments
while
putting
our
country
on
more
fiscally
sustainable
path
proposed
freeze
in
government
spending
for
three
years
this
apply
to
the
benefits
folks
get
through
social
security
or
and
it
apply
to
our
national
security
including
benefits
for
veterans
but
it
will
apply
to
all
other
discretionary
government
programs
and
we
not
simply
photocopying
last
year
budget
freezing
spending
does
not
mean
we
cut
what
does
work
to
pay
for
what
does
we
have
gone
through
every
department
spending
line
by
line
item
by
item
looking
for
inefficiency
duplication
and
programs
that
have
outlived
their
usefulness
that
how
we
freeze
discretionary
spending
last
year
we
found
billion
in
cuts
this
year
we
already
found
billion
now
some
of
these
cuts
are
just
common
sense
for
example
we
cut
million
from
program
that
pays
states
to
clean
up
mines
that
have
already
been
cleaned
up
we
also
cutting
forest
service
economic
development
program
that
strayed
so
far
from
any
mission
that
it
funded
music
festival
and
we
saving
million
by
stopping
the
refurbishment
of
department
of
energy
science
that
the
department
of
energy
does
not
want
to
refurbish
other
cuts
though
are
more
painful
because
the
goals
of
the
underlying
programs
are
worthy
we
eliminate
one
program
that
provides
grants
to
do
environmental
clean
up
of
abandoned
buildings
that
mission
support
but
there
are
other
sources
of
private
and
public
funds
to
achieve
it
we
also
eliminated
million
program
that
allows
folks
to
get
their
earned
income
tax
credit
in
advance
am
big
supporter
of
the
earned
income
tax
credit
the
problem
is
percent
of
people
who
got
this
advance
did
comply
with
one
or
more
of
the
program
requirements
so
willing
to
reduce
waste
in
programs
care
about
and
asking
members
of
congress
to
do
the
same
asking
republicans
and
democrats
alike
to
take
fresh
look
at
programs
they
supported
in
the
past
to
see
what
working
and
what
not
and
trim
back
accordingly
like
any
business
we
also
looking
for
ways
to
get
more
bang
for
our
buck
by
promoting
innovation
and
cutting
red
tape
for
example
we
consolidate
separate
education
programs
into
and
last
fall
we
launched
the
save
awards
to
solicit
ideas
from
federal
employees
about
how
make
government
more
efficient
and
more
effective
proud
to
say
that
number
of
these
ideas
like
allowing
social
security
appointments
to
be
made
made
it
into
our
budget
also
want
to
note
even
though
the
department
of
is
exempt
from
the
budget
freeze
it
not
exempt
from
budget
common
sense
it
not
exempt
from
looking
for
savings
we
save
money
by
eliminating
unnecessary
programs
that
do
nothing
to
keep
us
safe
one
example
is
the
billion
that
we
spending
to
build
transport
aircraft
four
years
ago
the
department
decided
to
cease
production
because
it
had
acquired
the
number
requested
yet
every
year
since
congress
had
provided
unrequested
money
for
more
that
the
pentagon
does
want
or
need
it
waste
pure
and
simple
and
there
are
other
steps
we
taking
to
rein
in
deficits
proposed
fee
on
big
banks
to
pay
back
taxpayers
for
the
bailout
we
reforming
the
way
contracts
are
awarded
to
save
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
and
while
we
extend
tax
cuts
in
this
budget
we
will
not
continue
costly
tax
cuts
for
oil
companies
investment
fund
managers
and
those
making
over
year
we
just
afford
it
finally
changing
depends
on
changing
and
that
why
proposed
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
panel
of
democrats
and
republicans
who
would
hammer
out
concrete
deficit
reduction
proposals
over
the
medium
and
long
term
but
would
come
up
with
those
answers
by
certain
deadline
should
point
out
by
the
way
that
is
an
idea
that
had
strong
bipartisan
support
was
originally
introduced
by
senators
on
the
republican
side
and
on
the
democratic
side
had
lot
of
republican
to
the
idea
hope
that
despite
the
fact
that
it
got
voted
down
in
the
senate
that
both
the
republican
leader
and
the
republican
leader
in
the
house
john
go
ahead
and
fully
embrace
what
has
been
bipartisan
idea
to
get
our
arms
around
this
budget
that
also
why
we
restoring
simple
rule
that
says
congress
spend
dime
without
cutting
dime
elsewhere
this
rule
helped
lead
to
the
budget
surpluses
of
the
and
it
one
of
the
most
important
steps
we
can
take
to
restore
fiscal
discipline
in
washington
you
can
read
more
about
the
budget
at
very
easy
to
remember
but
the
bottom
line
is
this
we
simply
can
not
continue
to
spend
as
if
deficits
do
have
consequences
as
if
waste
does
matter
as
if
the
tax
dollars
of
the
american
people
can
be
treated
like
monopoly
money
as
if
we
can
ignore
this
challenge
for
another
generation
we
in
order
to
meet
this
challenge
welcome
any
idea
from
democrats
and
republicans
what
will
not
welcome
what
reject
is
the
same
old
when
the
cameras
are
on
and
the
same
irresponsible
budget
policies
when
the
cameras
are
off
it
time
to
hold
washington
to
the
same
standards
families
and
businesses
hold
themselves
it
time
to
save
what
we
can
spend
what
we
must
and
live
within
our
means
once
again
thanks
very
much
madame
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
distinguished
guests
and
fellow
americans
our
constitution
declares
that
from
time
to
time
the
president
shall
give
to
congress
information
about
the
state
of
our
union
for
two
hundred
and
twenty
years
our
leaders
have
fulfilled
this
duty
they
done
so
during
periods
of
prosperity
and
and
they
done
so
in
the
midst
of
war
and
depression
at
moments
of
great
strife
and
great
struggle
it
tempting
to
look
back
on
these
moments
and
assume
that
our
progress
was
inevitable
that
america
was
always
destined
to
succeed
but
when
the
union
was
turned
back
at
bull
run
and
the
allies
first
landed
at
beach
victory
was
very
much
in
doubt
when
the
market
crashed
on
black
tuesday
and
civil
rights
marchers
were
beaten
on
bloody
sunday
the
future
was
anything
but
certain
these
were
the
times
that
tested
the
courage
of
our
convictions
and
the
strength
of
our
union
and
despite
all
our
divisions
and
disagreements
our
hesitations
and
our
fears
america
prevailed
because
we
chose
to
move
forward
as
one
nation
and
one
people
again
we
are
tested
and
again
we
must
answer
history
call
one
year
ago
took
office
amid
two
wars
an
economy
rocked
by
severe
recession
financial
system
on
the
verge
of
collapse
and
government
deeply
in
debt
experts
from
across
the
political
spectrum
warned
that
if
we
did
not
act
we
might
face
second
depression
so
we
acted
immediately
and
aggressively
and
one
year
later
the
worst
of
the
storm
has
passed
but
the
devastation
remains
one
in
ten
americans
still
can
not
find
work
many
businesses
have
shuttered
home
values
have
declined
small
towns
and
rural
communities
have
been
hit
especially
hard
and
for
those
who
had
already
known
poverty
life
become
that
much
harder
and
this
recession
has
also
compounded
the
burdens
that
america
families
have
been
dealing
with
for
decades
the
burden
of
working
harder
and
longer
for
less
of
being
unable
to
save
enough
to
retire
or
help
kids
with
college
so
know
the
anxieties
that
are
out
there
right
now
they
not
new
these
struggles
are
the
reason
ran
for
president
these
struggles
are
what
witnessed
for
years
in
places
like
indiana
illinois
hear
about
them
in
the
letters
that
read
each
night
the
toughest
to
read
are
those
written
by
children
asking
why
they
have
to
move
from
their
home
asking
or
when
their
mom
or
dad
will
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
for
these
americans
and
so
many
others
change
has
not
come
fast
enough
some
are
frustrated
some
are
angry
they
do
understand
why
it
seems
like
bad
on
wall
street
is
rewarded
but
hard
work
on
main
street
is
or
why
washington
has
been
unable
or
unwilling
to
solve
any
of
our
problems
they
tired
of
the
partisanship
and
the
shouting
and
the
pettiness
they
know
we
afford
it
not
now
so
we
face
big
and
difficult
challenges
and
what
the
american
people
hope
what
they
deserve
is
for
all
of
us
democrats
and
republicans
to
work
through
our
differences
to
overcome
the
numbing
weight
of
our
politics
for
while
the
people
who
sent
us
here
have
different
backgrounds
different
stories
different
beliefs
the
anxieties
they
face
are
the
same
the
aspirations
they
hold
are
shared
job
that
pays
the
bills
chance
to
get
ahead
most
of
all
the
ability
to
give
their
children
better
life
and
you
know
what
else
they
share
they
share
stubborn
resilience
in
the
face
of
adversity
after
one
of
the
most
difficult
years
in
our
history
they
remain
busy
building
cars
and
teaching
kids
starting
businesses
and
going
back
to
school
they
coaching
little
league
and
helping
their
one
woman
wrote
to
me
and
said
we
are
strained
but
hopeful
struggling
but
encouraged
it
because
of
this
spirit
this
great
decency
and
great
strength
that
have
never
been
more
hopeful
about
america
future
than
am
tonight
despite
despite
our
hardships
our
union
is
strong
we
do
not
give
up
we
do
not
quit
we
do
not
allow
fear
or
division
to
break
our
spirit
in
this
new
decade
it
time
the
american
people
get
government
that
matches
their
decency
that
embodies
their
strength
and
tonight
tonight
like
to
talk
about
how
together
we
can
deliver
on
that
promise
it
begins
with
our
economy
our
most
urgent
our
most
urgent
task
upon
taking
office
was
to
shore
up
the
same
banks
that
helped
cause
this
crisis
it
was
not
easy
to
do
and
if
there
one
thing
that
has
unified
democrats
and
republicans
and
everybody
in
between
it
that
we
all
hated
the
bank
bailout
hated
it
hated
it
hated
it
you
hated
it
it
was
about
as
popular
as
root
canal
but
when
ran
for
president
promised
would
just
do
what
was
popular
would
do
what
was
necessary
and
if
we
had
allowed
the
meltdown
of
the
financial
system
unemployment
might
be
double
what
it
is
today
more
businesses
would
certainly
have
closed
more
homes
would
have
surely
been
lost
so
supported
the
last
administration
efforts
to
create
the
financial
rescue
program
and
when
we
took
the
program
over
we
made
it
more
transparent
and
more
accountable
and
as
result
the
markets
are
now
and
we
recovered
most
of
the
money
we
spent
on
the
banks
most
but
not
all
to
recover
the
rest
proposed
fee
on
the
biggest
banks
now
now
know
wall
street
is
keen
on
this
idea
but
if
these
firms
can
afford
to
hand
out
big
bonuses
again
they
can
afford
modest
fee
to
pay
back
the
taxpayers
who
rescued
them
in
their
time
of
need
now
as
we
the
financial
system
we
also
took
steps
to
get
our
economy
growing
again
save
as
many
jobs
as
possible
and
help
americans
who
had
become
unemployed
that
why
we
extended
or
increased
unemployment
benefits
for
more
than
million
americans
made
health
insurance
cheaper
for
families
who
get
their
coverage
through
cobra
and
passed
different
tax
cuts
now
let
me
repeat
we
cut
taxes
we
cut
taxes
for
of
working
families
we
cut
taxes
for
small
businesses
we
cut
taxes
for
we
cut
taxes
for
parents
trying
to
care
for
their
children
we
cut
taxes
for
eight
million
americans
paying
for
college
thought
get
some
applause
on
that
one
as
result
as
result
millions
of
americans
had
more
to
spend
on
gas
and
food
and
other
necessities
all
of
which
helped
businesses
keep
more
workers
and
we
have
raised
income
taxes
by
single
dime
on
single
person
not
single
dime
now
because
of
the
steps
we
took
there
are
about
two
million
americans
working
right
now
who
would
otherwise
be
unemployed
work
in
construction
and
clean
energy
are
teachers
and
other
education
workers
tens
of
thousands
are
cops
firefighters
correctional
officers
first
responders
and
we
on
track
to
add
another
one
and
half
million
jobs
to
this
total
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
plan
that
has
made
all
of
this
possible
from
the
tax
cuts
to
the
jobs
is
the
recovery
act
that
right
the
recovery
act
also
known
as
the
stimulus
bill
economists
on
the
left
and
the
right
say
this
bill
has
helped
saved
jobs
and
avert
disaster
but
you
do
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
talk
to
the
small
business
in
phoenix
that
will
triple
its
workforce
because
of
the
recovery
act
talk
to
the
window
manufacturer
in
who
said
he
used
to
be
about
the
recovery
act
until
he
had
to
add
two
more
work
shifts
just
because
of
the
business
it
created
talk
to
the
single
teacher
raising
two
kids
who
was
told
by
her
principal
in
the
last
week
of
school
that
because
of
the
recovery
act
she
would
be
laid
off
after
all
there
are
stories
like
this
all
across
america
and
after
two
years
of
recession
the
economy
is
growing
again
retirement
funds
have
started
to
gain
back
some
of
their
value
businesses
are
beginning
to
invest
again
and
slowly
some
are
starting
to
hire
again
but
that
for
every
success
story
there
are
other
stories
of
men
and
women
who
wake
up
with
the
anguish
of
not
knowing
where
their
next
will
come
from
who
send
out
resumes
week
after
week
and
hear
nothing
in
response
that
is
why
jobs
must
be
our
number
one
focus
in
and
that
why
calling
for
new
jobs
bill
tonight
now
the
true
engine
of
job
creation
in
this
country
will
always
be
america
businesses
agree
absolutely
but
government
can
create
the
conditions
necessary
for
businesses
to
expand
and
hire
more
workers
we
should
start
where
most
new
jobs
do
in
small
businesses
companies
that
begin
when
companies
that
begin
when
an
entrepreneur
when
an
entrepreneur
takes
chance
on
dream
or
worker
decides
its
time
she
became
her
own
boss
through
sheer
grit
and
determination
these
companies
have
weathered
the
recession
and
they
ready
to
grow
but
when
you
talk
to
small
business
owners
in
places
like
or
ohio
you
find
out
that
even
though
banks
on
wall
street
are
lending
again
they
mostly
lending
to
bigger
companies
financing
remains
difficult
for
small
business
owners
across
the
country
even
those
that
are
making
profit
so
tonight
proposing
that
we
take
billion
dollars
of
the
money
wall
street
banks
have
repaid
and
use
it
to
help
community
banks
give
small
businesses
the
credit
they
need
to
stay
afloat
also
proposing
new
small
business
tax
credit
one
that
will
go
to
over
one
million
small
businesses
who
hire
new
workers
or
raise
wages
while
we
at
it
let
also
eliminate
all
capital
gains
taxes
on
small
business
investment
and
provide
tax
incentive
for
all
large
businesses
and
all
small
businesses
to
invest
in
new
plants
and
equipment
next
we
can
put
americans
to
work
today
building
the
infrastructure
of
tomorrow
from
from
the
first
to
the
highway
system
our
nation
has
always
been
built
to
compete
there
no
reason
europe
or
china
should
have
the
fastest
trains
or
the
new
factories
that
manufacture
clean
energy
products
tomorrow
visit
florida
where
workers
will
soon
break
ground
on
new
railroad
funded
by
the
recovery
act
there
are
projects
like
that
all
across
this
country
that
will
create
jobs
and
help
our
move
our
nation
goods
services
and
information
we
should
put
more
americans
to
work
building
clean
energy
facilities
and
give
and
give
rebates
to
americans
who
make
their
homes
more
energy
efficient
which
supports
clean
energy
jobs
and
to
encourage
these
and
other
businesses
to
stay
within
our
borders
it
is
time
to
finally
slash
the
tax
breaks
for
companies
that
ship
our
jobs
overseas
and
give
those
tax
breaks
to
companies
that
create
jobs
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
now
the
house
has
passed
jobs
bill
that
includes
some
of
these
steps
as
the
first
order
of
business
this
year
urge
the
senate
to
do
the
same
and
know
they
will
they
will
people
are
out
of
work
they
hurting
and
they
need
our
help
and
want
jobs
bill
on
my
desk
without
delay
but
but
the
truth
is
these
steps
still
make
up
for
the
seven
million
jobs
that
we
lost
over
the
last
two
years
the
only
way
to
move
to
full
employment
is
to
lay
new
foundation
for
economic
growth
and
finally
address
the
problems
that
america
families
have
confronted
for
years
we
afford
another
economic
expansion
like
the
one
from
the
last
decade
what
some
call
the
lost
decade
where
jobs
grew
more
slowly
than
during
any
prior
expansion
where
the
income
of
the
average
american
household
declined
while
the
cost
of
health
care
and
tuition
reached
record
highs
where
prosperity
was
built
on
housing
bubble
and
financial
speculation
from
the
day
took
office
been
told
that
addressing
our
larger
challenges
is
too
ambitious
such
an
effort
would
be
too
contentious
been
told
that
our
political
system
is
too
and
that
we
should
just
put
things
on
hold
for
awhile
for
those
who
make
these
claims
have
one
simple
question
how
long
should
we
wait
how
long
should
america
put
its
future
on
hold
you
see
you
see
washington
has
been
telling
us
to
wait
for
decades
even
as
the
problems
have
grown
worse
meanwhile
china
not
waiting
to
revamp
its
economy
germany
not
waiting
india
not
waiting
these
nations
are
they
not
standing
still
these
nations
are
playing
for
second
place
they
putting
more
emphasis
on
math
and
science
they
rebuilding
their
infrastructure
they
making
serious
investments
in
clean
energy
because
they
want
those
jobs
well
do
not
accept
for
the
united
states
of
america
as
hard
as
it
may
be
as
uncomfortable
and
contentious
as
the
debates
may
become
it
time
to
get
serious
about
fixing
the
problems
that
are
hampering
our
growth
now
one
place
to
start
is
serious
financial
reform
look
am
not
interested
in
punishing
banks
interested
in
protecting
our
economy
strong
healthy
financial
market
makes
it
possible
for
businesses
to
access
credit
and
create
new
jobs
it
channels
the
savings
of
families
into
investments
that
raise
incomes
but
that
can
only
happen
if
we
guard
against
the
same
recklessness
that
nearly
brought
down
our
entire
economy
we
need
to
make
sure
consumers
and
families
have
the
information
they
need
to
make
financial
decisions
we
allow
financial
institutions
including
those
that
take
your
deposits
to
take
risks
that
threaten
the
whole
economy
now
the
house
has
already
passed
financial
reform
with
many
of
these
changes
and
and
the
lobbyists
are
trying
to
kill
it
well
we
can
not
let
them
win
this
fight
and
if
the
bill
that
ends
up
on
my
desk
does
not
meet
the
test
of
real
reform
will
send
it
back
until
we
get
it
right
we
got
to
get
it
right
next
we
need
to
encourage
american
innovation
last
year
we
made
the
largest
investment
in
basic
research
funding
in
history
an
investment
an
investment
that
could
lead
to
the
world
cheapest
solar
cells
or
treatment
that
kills
cancer
cells
but
leaves
healthy
ones
untouched
and
no
area
is
more
ripe
for
such
innovation
than
energy
you
can
see
the
results
of
last
year
investment
in
clean
energy
in
the
north
company
that
will
create
jobs
nationwide
helping
to
make
advanced
batteries
or
in
the
california
business
that
will
put
thousand
people
to
work
making
solar
panels
but
to
create
more
of
these
clean
energy
jobs
we
need
more
production
more
efficiency
more
incentives
and
that
means
building
new
generation
of
safe
clean
nuclear
power
plants
in
this
country
it
means
making
tough
decisions
about
opening
new
offshore
areas
for
oil
and
gas
development
it
means
continued
investment
in
advanced
and
clean
coal
technologies
and
yes
it
means
passing
comprehensive
energy
and
climate
bill
with
incentives
that
will
finally
make
clean
energy
the
profitable
kind
of
energy
in
america
am
grateful
to
the
house
for
passing
such
bill
last
year
and
this
year
this
year
am
eager
to
help
advance
the
bipartisan
effort
in
the
senate
know
there
have
been
questions
about
whether
we
can
afford
such
changes
in
tough
economy
know
that
there
are
those
who
disagree
with
the
overwhelming
scientific
evidence
on
climate
change
but
but
here
here
the
thing
even
if
you
doubt
the
evidence
providing
incentives
for
energy
efficiency
and
clean
energy
are
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
future
because
the
nation
that
leads
the
clean
energy
economy
will
be
the
nation
that
leads
the
global
economy
and
america
must
be
that
nation
third
we
need
to
export
more
of
our
goods
because
the
more
products
we
make
and
sell
to
other
countries
the
more
jobs
we
support
right
here
in
america
so
so
tonight
we
set
new
goal
we
will
double
our
exports
over
the
next
five
years
an
increase
that
will
support
two
million
jobs
in
america
to
help
meet
this
goal
we
launching
national
export
initiative
that
will
help
farmers
and
small
businesses
increase
their
exports
and
reform
export
controls
consistent
with
national
security
we
have
to
seek
new
markets
aggressively
just
as
our
competitors
are
if
america
sits
on
the
sidelines
while
other
nations
sign
trade
deals
we
will
lose
the
chance
to
create
jobs
on
our
shores
but
those
benefits
also
means
enforcing
those
agreements
so
our
trading
partners
play
by
the
rules
and
that
why
we
continue
to
shape
trade
agreement
that
opens
global
markets
and
why
we
will
strengthen
our
trade
relations
in
asia
and
with
key
partners
like
south
korea
and
panama
and
fourth
we
need
to
invest
in
the
skills
and
education
of
our
people
now
this
year
this
year
we
broken
through
the
stalemate
between
left
and
right
by
launching
national
competition
to
improve
our
schools
and
the
idea
here
is
simple
instead
of
rewarding
failure
we
only
reward
success
instead
of
funding
the
status
we
only
invest
in
reform
reform
that
raises
student
achievement
inspires
students
to
excel
in
math
and
science
and
turns
around
failing
schools
that
steal
the
future
of
too
many
young
americans
from
rural
communities
to
the
inner
city
in
the
century
the
best
program
around
is
education
and
in
this
country
the
success
of
our
children
can
not
depend
more
on
where
they
live
than
on
their
potential
when
we
renew
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
we
will
work
with
congress
to
expand
these
reforms
to
all
states
still
in
this
economy
high
school
diploma
no
longer
guarantees
good
job
that
why
urge
the
senate
to
follow
the
house
and
pass
bill
that
will
our
community
colleges
which
are
career
pathway
to
the
children
of
so
many
working
families
to
make
college
more
affordable
this
bill
will
finally
end
the
unwarranted
taxpayer
subsidies
that
go
to
banks
for
student
loans
instead
let
take
that
money
and
give
families
dollar
tax
credit
for
four
years
of
college
and
increase
grants
and
let
tell
another
one
million
students
that
when
they
graduate
they
will
be
required
to
pay
only
percent
of
their
income
on
student
loans
and
all
of
their
debt
will
be
forgiven
after
years
and
forgiven
after
years
if
they
choose
career
in
public
service
because
in
the
united
states
of
america
no
one
should
go
broke
because
they
chose
to
go
to
college
and
by
the
way
it
time
for
colleges
and
universities
to
get
serious
about
cutting
their
own
costs
because
they
too
have
responsibility
to
help
solve
this
problem
now
the
price
of
college
tuition
is
just
one
of
the
burdens
facing
the
that
why
last
year
asked
vice
president
to
chair
task
force
on
families
that
why
we
nearly
doubling
the
child
care
tax
credit
and
making
it
easier
to
save
for
retirement
by
giving
access
to
every
worker
retirement
account
and
expanding
the
tax
credit
for
those
who
start
nest
egg
that
why
we
working
to
lift
the
value
of
family
single
largest
investment
their
home
the
steps
we
took
last
year
to
shore
up
the
housing
market
have
allowed
millions
of
americans
to
take
out
new
loans
and
save
an
average
of
dollars
on
mortgage
payments
this
year
we
will
step
up
so
that
homeowners
can
move
into
more
affordable
mortgages
and
and
it
is
precisely
to
relieve
the
burden
on
families
that
we
still
need
health
insurance
reform
yes
we
do
now
let
clear
few
things
up
did
choose
to
tackle
this
issue
to
get
some
legislative
victory
under
my
belt
and
by
now
it
should
be
fairly
obvious
that
did
take
on
health
care
because
it
was
good
politics
took
on
health
care
because
of
the
stories
heard
from
americans
with
conditions
whose
lives
depend
on
getting
coverage
patients
who
been
denied
coverage
families
even
those
with
insurance
who
are
just
one
illness
away
from
financial
ruin
after
nearly
century
of
trying
democratic
administrations
republican
administrations
we
are
closer
than
ever
to
bringing
more
security
to
the
lives
of
so
many
americans
the
approach
we
taken
would
protect
every
american
from
the
worst
practices
of
the
insurance
industry
it
would
give
small
businesses
and
uninsured
americans
chance
to
choose
an
affordable
health
care
plan
in
competitive
market
it
would
require
every
insurance
plan
to
cover
preventive
care
and
by
the
way
want
to
acknowledge
our
first
lady
who
this
year
is
creating
national
movement
to
tackle
the
epidemic
of
childhood
obesity
and
make
kids
healthier
thank
you
she
gets
embarrassed
our
approach
would
preserve
the
right
of
americans
who
have
insurance
to
keep
their
doctor
and
their
plan
it
would
reduce
costs
and
premiums
for
millions
of
families
and
businesses
and
according
to
the
congressional
budget
office
the
independent
that
both
parties
have
cited
as
the
official
for
congress
our
approach
would
bring
down
the
deficit
by
as
much
as
one
trillion
dollars
over
the
next
two
decades
still
this
is
issue
and
the
longer
it
was
debated
the
more
people
became
take
my
share
of
the
blame
for
not
explaining
it
more
clearly
to
the
american
people
and
know
that
with
all
the
lobbying
and
the
process
left
most
americans
wondering
what
in
it
for
me
but
also
know
this
problem
is
not
going
away
by
the
time
finished
speaking
tonight
more
americans
will
have
lost
their
health
insurance
millions
will
lose
it
this
year
our
deficit
will
grow
premiums
will
go
up
patients
will
be
denied
the
care
they
need
small
business
owners
will
continue
to
drop
coverage
altogether
will
not
walk
away
from
these
americans
and
neither
should
the
people
in
this
chamber
so
as
temperatures
cool
want
everyone
to
take
another
look
at
the
plan
we
proposed
there
reason
why
many
doctors
nurses
and
health
care
experts
who
know
our
system
best
consider
this
approach
vast
improvement
over
the
status
but
if
anyone
from
either
party
has
better
approach
that
will
bring
down
premiums
bring
down
the
deficit
cover
the
uninsured
strengthen
for
seniors
and
stop
insurance
company
abuses
let
me
know
let
me
know
let
me
know
eager
to
see
it
here
what
ask
congress
though
do
walk
away
from
reform
not
now
not
when
we
are
so
close
let
us
find
way
to
come
together
and
finish
the
job
for
the
american
people
let
get
it
done
let
get
it
done
now
even
as
health
care
reform
would
reduce
our
deficit
it
not
enough
to
dig
us
out
of
massive
fiscal
hole
in
which
we
find
ourselves
it
challenge
that
makes
all
others
that
much
harder
to
solve
and
one
that
been
subject
to
lot
of
political
posturing
so
let
me
start
the
discussion
of
government
spending
by
setting
the
record
straight
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
decade
the
year
america
had
budget
surplus
of
over
billion
dollars
by
by
the
time
took
office
we
had
deficit
of
over
one
trillion
dollars
and
projected
deficits
of
eight
trillion
dollars
over
the
next
decade
most
of
this
was
the
result
of
not
paying
for
two
wars
two
tax
cuts
and
an
expensive
prescription
drug
program
on
top
of
that
the
effects
of
the
recession
put
three
trillion
dollar
hole
in
our
budget
all
this
was
before
walked
in
the
door
now
now
just
stating
the
facts
now
if
we
had
taken
office
in
ordinary
times
would
have
liked
nothing
more
than
to
start
bringing
down
the
deficit
but
we
took
office
amid
crisis
and
our
efforts
to
prevent
second
depression
have
added
another
one
trillion
dollars
to
our
national
debt
that
too
is
fact
absolutely
convinced
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do
but
families
across
the
country
are
tightening
their
belts
and
making
tough
decisions
the
federal
government
should
do
the
same
so
tonight
proposing
specific
steps
to
pay
for
the
trillion
dollars
that
it
took
to
rescue
the
economy
last
year
starting
in
we
are
prepared
to
freeze
government
spending
for
three
years
spending
related
to
our
national
security
and
social
security
will
not
be
affected
but
all
other
discretionary
government
programs
will
like
any
family
we
will
work
within
budget
to
invest
in
what
we
need
and
sacrifice
what
we
do
and
if
have
to
enforce
this
discipline
by
veto
will
we
will
continue
to
go
through
the
budget
line
by
line
page
by
page
to
eliminate
programs
that
we
afford
and
do
work
we
already
identified
billion
dollars
in
savings
for
next
year
to
help
working
families
we
extend
our
tax
cuts
but
at
time
of
record
deficits
we
will
not
continue
tax
cuts
for
oil
companies
for
investment
fund
managers
and
for
those
making
over
dollars
year
we
just
afford
it
now
even
after
paying
for
what
we
spent
on
my
watch
we
still
face
the
massive
deficit
we
had
when
took
office
more
importantly
the
cost
of
and
social
security
will
continue
to
that
why
called
for
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
on
proposal
by
republican
and
democrat
kent
this
be
one
of
those
washington
gimmicks
that
lets
us
pretend
we
solved
problem
the
commission
will
have
to
provide
specific
set
of
solutions
by
certain
deadline
now
yesterday
the
senate
blocked
bill
that
would
have
created
this
commission
so
issue
an
executive
order
that
will
allow
us
to
go
forward
because
refuse
to
pass
this
problem
on
to
another
generation
of
americans
and
when
the
vote
comes
tomorrow
the
senate
should
restore
the
law
that
was
big
reason
for
why
we
had
record
surpluses
in
the
now
know
that
some
in
my
own
party
will
argue
that
we
address
the
deficit
or
freeze
government
spending
when
so
many
are
still
hurting
and
agree
which
is
why
this
freeze
take
effect
until
next
year
when
the
economy
is
stronger
that
how
budgeting
works
but
understand
understand
if
we
do
take
meaningful
steps
to
rein
in
our
debt
it
could
damage
our
markets
increase
the
cost
of
borrowing
and
our
recovery
all
of
which
would
have
an
even
worse
effect
on
our
job
growth
and
family
incomes
from
some
on
the
right
expect
we
hear
different
argument
that
if
we
just
make
fewer
investments
in
our
people
extend
tax
cuts
including
those
for
the
wealthier
americans
eliminate
more
regulations
maintain
the
status
on
health
care
our
deficits
will
go
away
the
problem
is
that
what
we
did
for
eight
years
that
what
helped
us
into
this
crisis
it
what
helped
lead
to
these
deficits
we
do
it
again
rather
than
fight
the
same
tired
battles
that
have
dominated
washington
for
decades
it
time
to
try
something
new
let
invest
in
our
people
without
leaving
them
mountain
of
debt
let
meet
our
responsibility
to
the
citizens
who
sent
us
here
let
try
common
sense
novel
concept
now
to
do
that
we
have
to
that
we
face
more
than
deficit
of
dollars
right
now
we
face
deficit
of
trust
deep
and
corrosive
doubts
about
how
washington
works
that
have
been
growing
for
years
to
close
that
credibility
gap
we
have
to
take
action
on
both
ends
of
avenue
to
end
the
influence
of
lobbyists
to
do
our
work
openly
to
give
our
people
the
government
they
deserve
now
that
what
came
to
washington
to
do
that
why
for
the
first
time
in
history
my
administration
posts
on
our
white
house
visitors
that
why
we
excluded
lobbyists
from
jobs
or
seats
on
federal
boards
and
commissions
but
we
stop
there
it
time
to
require
lobbyists
to
disclose
each
contact
they
make
on
behalf
of
client
with
my
administration
or
with
congress
it
time
to
put
strict
limits
on
the
contributions
that
lobbyists
give
to
candidates
for
federal
office
with
all
due
deference
to
separation
of
powers
last
week
the
supreme
court
reversed
century
of
law
that
believe
will
open
the
floodgates
for
special
interests
including
foreign
corporations
to
spend
without
limit
in
our
elections
do
think
american
elections
should
be
by
america
most
powerful
interests
or
worse
by
foreign
entities
they
should
be
decided
by
the
american
people
and
urge
democrats
and
republicans
to
pass
bill
that
helps
to
correct
some
of
these
problems
also
calling
on
congress
to
continue
down
the
path
of
earmark
reform
democrats
and
republicans
democrats
and
republicans
look
you
trimmed
some
of
this
spending
you
embraced
some
meaningful
change
but
restoring
the
public
trust
demands
more
for
example
some
members
of
congress
post
some
earmark
requests
tonight
calling
on
congress
to
publish
all
earmark
requests
on
single
web
site
before
there
vote
so
that
the
american
people
can
see
how
their
money
is
being
spent
of
course
none
of
these
reforms
will
even
happen
if
we
do
also
reform
how
we
work
with
one
another
now
not
never
thought
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
election
would
usher
in
peace
and
harmony
and
some
era
knew
that
both
parties
have
fed
divisions
that
are
deeply
entrenched
and
on
some
issues
there
are
simply
philosophical
differences
that
will
always
cause
us
to
part
ways
these
disagreements
about
the
role
of
government
in
our
lives
about
our
national
priorities
and
our
national
security
they
been
taking
place
for
over
years
they
the
very
essence
of
our
democracy
but
what
frustrates
the
american
people
is
washington
where
every
day
is
election
day
we
wage
perpetual
campaign
where
the
only
goal
is
to
see
who
can
get
the
most
embarrassing
headlines
about
the
other
side
belief
that
if
you
lose
neither
party
should
delay
or
obstruct
every
single
bill
just
because
they
can
the
confirmation
of
speaking
to
both
parties
now
the
confirmation
of
public
servants
should
be
held
hostage
to
the
pet
projects
or
grudges
of
few
individual
senators
washington
may
think
that
saying
anything
about
the
other
side
no
matter
how
false
no
matter
how
malicious
is
just
part
of
the
game
but
it
precisely
such
politics
that
has
stopped
either
party
from
helping
the
american
people
worse
yet
worse
yet
it
sowing
further
division
among
our
citizens
further
distrust
in
our
government
so
no
will
not
give
up
on
trying
to
change
the
tone
of
our
politics
know
it
an
election
year
and
after
last
week
it
clear
that
campaign
fever
has
come
even
earlier
than
usual
but
we
still
need
to
govern
to
democrats
would
remind
you
that
we
still
have
the
largest
majority
in
decades
and
the
people
expect
us
to
solve
problems
not
run
for
the
hills
and
if
the
republican
leadership
is
going
to
insist
that
that
votes
in
the
senate
are
required
to
do
any
business
at
all
in
this
town
then
the
responsibility
to
govern
is
now
yours
as
well
just
saying
no
to
everything
may
be
good
politics
but
it
not
leadership
we
were
sent
here
to
serve
our
citizens
not
our
ambitions
so
let
show
the
american
people
that
we
can
do
it
together
this
week
this
week
be
meet
addressing
meeting
of
the
house
republicans
like
to
begin
monthly
meetings
with
both
democratic
and
republican
leadership
know
you
wait
now
throughout
our
history
no
issue
has
united
this
country
more
than
our
security
sadly
some
of
the
unity
we
felt
after
has
dissipated
now
we
can
argue
all
we
want
about
who
to
blame
for
this
but
not
interested
in
the
past
know
that
all
of
us
love
this
country
all
of
us
are
committed
to
its
so
let
put
aside
the
taunts
about
who
is
tough
let
reject
the
false
choice
between
protecting
our
people
and
upholding
our
values
let
leave
behind
the
fear
and
division
and
do
what
it
takes
to
defend
our
nation
and
forge
more
hopeful
future
for
america
and
for
the
world
that
the
work
we
began
last
year
since
the
day
took
office
we
renewed
our
focus
on
the
terrorists
who
threaten
our
nation
we
made
substantial
investments
in
our
homeland
security
and
disrupted
plots
that
threatened
to
take
american
lives
we
are
filling
unacceptable
gaps
revealed
by
the
failed
attack
with
better
airline
security
and
swifter
action
on
our
intelligence
we
prohibited
torture
and
strengthened
partnerships
from
the
pacific
to
south
asia
to
the
arabian
peninsula
and
in
the
last
year
hundreds
of
fighters
and
affiliates
including
many
senior
leaders
have
been
captured
or
killed
far
more
than
in
and
in
we
increasing
our
troops
and
training
afghan
security
forces
so
they
can
begin
to
take
the
lead
in
july
of
and
our
troops
can
begin
to
come
home
we
will
reward
good
governance
work
to
reduce
corruption
and
support
the
rights
of
all
afghans
men
and
women
alike
we
joined
by
allies
and
partners
who
have
increased
their
own
commitments
and
who
will
come
together
tomorrow
in
london
to
reaffirm
our
common
purpose
there
will
be
difficult
days
ahead
but
am
absolutely
confident
we
will
succeed
as
we
take
the
fight
to
we
are
responsibly
leaving
iraq
to
its
people
as
candidate
promised
that
would
end
this
war
and
that
is
what
am
doing
as
president
we
will
have
all
of
our
combat
troops
out
of
iraq
by
the
end
of
this
august
we
will
support
we
will
support
the
iraqi
government
we
will
support
the
iraqi
government
as
they
hold
elections
and
we
will
continue
to
partner
with
the
iraqi
people
to
promote
regional
peace
and
prosperity
but
make
no
mistake
this
war
is
ending
and
all
of
our
troops
are
coming
home
tonight
all
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
in
iraq
in
and
around
the
world
they
have
to
know
that
we
that
they
have
our
respect
our
gratitude
our
full
support
and
just
as
they
must
have
the
resources
they
need
in
war
we
all
have
responsibility
to
support
them
when
they
come
home
that
why
we
made
the
largest
increase
in
investments
for
veterans
in
decades
last
year
that
why
we
building
century
and
that
why
has
joined
with
to
forge
national
commitment
to
support
military
families
now
even
as
we
prosecute
two
wars
we
also
confronting
perhaps
the
greatest
danger
to
the
american
people
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapons
embraced
the
vision
of
john
kennedy
and
through
strategy
that
reverses
the
spread
of
these
weapons
and
seeks
world
without
them
to
reduce
our
stockpiles
and
launchers
while
ensuring
our
deterrent
the
united
states
and
russia
are
completing
negotiations
on
the
arms
control
treaty
in
nearly
two
decades
and
at
april
nuclear
security
summit
we
will
bring
nations
together
here
in
washington
behind
clear
goal
securing
all
vulnerable
nuclear
materials
around
the
world
in
four
years
so
that
they
never
fall
into
the
hands
of
terrorists
now
these
diplomatic
efforts
have
also
strengthened
our
hand
in
dealing
with
those
nations
that
insist
on
violating
international
agreements
in
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
that
why
north
korea
now
faces
increased
isolation
and
stronger
sanctions
sanctions
that
are
being
vigorously
enforced
that
why
the
international
community
is
more
united
and
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
is
more
isolated
and
as
iran
leaders
continue
to
ignore
their
obligations
there
should
be
no
doubt
they
too
will
face
growing
consequences
that
is
promise
that
the
leadership
that
we
are
providing
engagement
that
advances
the
common
security
and
prosperity
of
all
people
we
working
through
the
to
sustain
lasting
global
recovery
we
working
with
muslim
communities
around
the
world
to
promote
science
and
education
and
innovation
we
have
gone
from
bystander
to
leader
in
the
fight
against
climate
change
we
helping
developing
countries
to
feed
themselves
and
continuing
the
fight
against
and
we
are
launching
new
initiative
that
will
give
us
the
capacity
to
respond
faster
and
more
effectively
to
or
an
infectious
disease
plan
that
will
counter
threats
at
home
and
strengthen
public
health
abroad
as
we
have
for
over
years
america
takes
these
actions
because
our
destiny
is
connected
to
those
beyond
our
shores
but
we
also
do
it
because
it
is
right
that
why
as
we
meet
here
tonight
over
americans
are
working
with
many
nations
to
help
the
people
of
haiti
recover
and
rebuild
that
why
we
stand
with
the
girl
who
yearns
to
go
to
school
in
why
we
support
the
human
rights
of
the
women
marching
through
the
streets
of
iran
why
we
advocate
for
the
young
man
denied
job
by
corruption
in
guinea
for
america
must
always
stand
on
the
side
of
freedom
and
human
dignity
always
abroad
america
greatest
source
of
strength
has
always
been
our
ideals
the
same
is
true
at
home
we
find
unity
in
our
incredible
diversity
drawing
on
the
promise
enshrined
in
our
constitution
the
notion
that
we
all
created
equal
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
what
you
look
like
if
you
abide
by
the
law
you
should
be
protected
by
it
if
you
adhere
to
our
common
values
you
should
be
treated
no
different
than
anyone
else
we
must
continually
renew
this
promise
my
administration
has
civil
rights
division
that
is
once
again
prosecuting
civil
rights
violations
and
employment
discrimination
we
finally
strengthened
we
finally
strengthened
our
laws
to
protect
against
crimes
driven
by
hate
this
year
this
year
will
work
with
congress
and
our
military
to
finally
repeal
the
law
that
denies
gay
americans
the
right
to
serve
the
country
they
love
because
of
who
they
are
it
the
right
thing
to
do
we
going
to
crack
down
on
violations
of
equal
pay
laws
so
that
women
get
equal
pay
for
an
equal
day
work
and
we
should
continue
the
work
of
fixing
our
broken
immigration
system
to
secure
our
borders
and
enforce
our
laws
and
ensure
that
everyone
who
plays
by
the
rules
can
contribute
to
our
economy
and
enrich
our
nations
in
the
end
it
our
ideals
our
values
that
built
america
values
that
allowed
us
to
forge
nation
made
up
of
immigrants
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
values
that
drive
our
citizens
still
every
day
americans
meet
their
responsibilities
to
their
families
and
their
employers
time
and
again
they
lend
hand
to
their
and
give
back
to
their
country
they
take
pride
in
their
and
are
generous
in
spirit
these
are
republican
values
or
democratic
values
that
they
living
by
business
values
or
values
they
american
values
unfortunately
too
many
of
our
citizens
have
lost
faith
that
our
biggest
institutions
our
corporations
our
media
and
yes
our
government
still
reflect
these
same
values
each
of
these
institutions
are
full
of
men
and
women
doing
important
work
that
helps
our
country
prosper
but
each
time
rewards
himself
for
failure
or
banker
puts
the
rest
of
us
at
risk
for
his
own
selfish
gain
people
doubts
grow
each
time
lobbyists
game
the
system
or
politicians
tear
each
other
down
instead
of
lifting
this
country
up
we
lose
faith
the
more
that
pundits
reduce
serious
debates
to
silly
arguments
big
issues
into
sound
bites
our
citizens
turn
away
no
wonder
there
so
much
cynicism
out
there
no
wonder
there
so
much
disappointment
campaigned
on
the
promise
of
change
change
we
can
believe
in
the
slogan
went
and
right
now
know
there
are
many
americans
who
are
sure
if
they
still
believe
we
can
change
or
that
can
deliver
it
but
remember
this
never
suggested
that
change
would
be
easy
or
that
could
do
it
alone
democracy
in
nation
of
million
people
can
be
noisy
and
messy
and
complicated
and
when
you
try
to
do
big
things
and
make
big
changes
it
stirs
passions
and
controversy
that
just
how
it
is
those
of
us
in
public
office
can
respond
to
this
reality
by
playing
it
safe
and
avoid
telling
hard
truths
and
pointing
fingers
we
can
do
what
necessary
to
keep
our
poll
numbers
high
and
get
through
the
next
election
instead
of
doing
what
best
for
the
next
generation
but
also
know
this
if
people
had
made
that
decision
years
ago
or
years
ago
or
years
ago
we
would
be
here
tonight
the
only
reason
we
are
here
is
because
generations
of
americans
were
unafraid
to
do
what
was
hard
to
do
what
was
needed
even
when
success
was
uncertain
to
do
what
it
took
to
keep
the
dream
of
this
nation
alive
for
their
children
and
their
grandchildren
our
administration
has
had
some
political
setbacks
this
year
and
some
of
them
were
deserved
but
wake
up
every
day
knowing
that
they
are
nothing
compared
to
the
setbacks
that
families
all
across
this
country
have
faced
this
year
and
what
keeps
me
going
what
keeps
me
fighting
is
that
despite
all
these
setbacks
that
spirit
of
determination
and
optimism
that
fundamental
decency
that
has
always
been
at
the
core
of
the
american
people
that
lives
on
it
lives
on
in
the
struggling
small
business
owner
who
wrote
to
me
of
his
company
none
of
us
he
said
willing
to
consider
even
slightly
that
we
might
fail
it
lives
on
in
the
woman
who
said
that
even
though
she
and
her
have
felt
the
pain
of
recession
we
are
strong
we
are
resilient
we
are
american
it
lives
on
in
the
boy
in
who
just
sent
me
his
allowance
and
asked
if
would
give
it
to
the
people
of
haiti
and
it
lives
on
in
all
the
americans
who
dropped
everything
to
go
they
never
been
and
pull
people
they
never
known
from
the
rubble
prompting
chants
of
when
another
life
was
saved
the
spirit
that
has
sustained
this
nation
for
more
than
two
centuries
lives
on
in
you
its
people
we
have
finished
difficult
year
we
have
come
through
difficult
decade
but
new
year
has
come
new
decade
stretches
before
us
we
do
quit
do
quit
let
seize
this
moment
to
start
anew
to
carry
the
dream
forward
and
to
strengthen
our
union
once
more
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
morning
and
thank
you
to
everyone
who
worked
to
bring
us
to
this
day
especially
the
international
council
and
the
state
museum
to
president
prime
minister
tusk
and
to
the
people
of
poland
thank
you
for
preserving
place
of
such
great
pain
for
the
polish
people
but
place
of
remembrance
and
learning
for
the
world
although
be
with
you
in
person
am
proud
that
the
united
states
is
represented
there
today
by
delegation
of
distinguished
americans
including
ambassador
my
wife
chief
of
staff
and
my
good
friend
and
the
son
of
holocaust
survivors
and
let
me
commend
you
for
woman
who
has
devoted
her
life
to
preserving
the
lessons
of
the
for
future
generations
of
the
united
states
holocaust
memorial
museum
in
washington
but
most
of
all
want
to
thank
those
of
you
who
found
the
strength
to
come
back
again
so
many
years
later
despite
the
horror
you
saw
here
the
suffering
you
endured
here
and
the
loved
ones
you
lost
here
those
of
us
who
did
not
live
through
those
dark
days
will
never
truly
understand
what
it
means
to
have
hate
literally
etched
into
your
arms
but
we
understand
the
message
that
you
carry
in
your
hearts
for
you
know
the
truth
that
spoke
when
stood
with
him
at
last
spring
there
where
his
father
and
so
many
innocent
souls
left
this
earth
said
memory
has
become
sacred
duty
of
all
people
of
we
have
sacred
duty
to
remember
the
twisted
thinking
that
led
here
how
great
society
of
culture
and
science
succumbed
to
the
worst
instincts
of
man
and
mass
murder
and
one
of
the
most
barbaric
acts
in
history
we
have
sacred
duty
to
remember
the
cruelty
that
occurred
here
as
told
in
the
simple
objects
that
speak
to
us
even
now
the
suitcases
that
still
bear
their
names
the
wooden
clogs
they
wore
the
round
bowls
from
which
they
ate
those
brick
buildings
from
which
there
was
no
escape
where
so
many
jews
died
with
israel
on
their
lips
and
the
very
earth
at
which
is
still
hallowed
by
their
ashes
jews
and
those
who
tried
to
save
them
polish
and
french
and
dutch
and
russian
straight
and
gay
and
so
many
others
but
even
as
we
recall
capacity
for
evil
also
tells
another
story
of
capacity
for
good
the
small
acts
of
compassion
the
sharing
of
some
bread
that
kept
child
alive
the
great
acts
of
resistance
that
blew
up
the
crematorium
and
tried
to
stop
the
slaughter
the
polish
rescuers
and
those
who
earned
their
place
forever
in
the
righteous
among
the
nations
and
you
the
survivors
the
perpetrators
of
that
crime
tried
to
annihilate
the
entire
jewish
people
but
they
failed
because
years
ago
today
when
the
gates
flew
open
you
were
still
standing
and
every
day
that
you
have
lived
every
child
and
grandchild
that
your
families
have
brought
into
the
world
with
love
every
day
the
sun
rises
on
the
jewish
state
of
israel
that
is
the
ultimate
rebuke
to
the
ignorance
and
hatred
of
this
place
so
to
those
of
you
who
have
come
back
today
say
no
you
are
not
you
are
living
memorials
living
memorials
to
the
loved
ones
you
left
here
and
to
the
spirit
we
must
strive
to
uphold
in
our
time
not
simply
to
bear
witness
but
to
bear
burden
the
burden
of
seeing
our
common
humanity
of
resisting
and
ignorance
in
all
its
forms
of
refusing
to
become
bystanders
to
evil
whenever
and
wherever
it
rears
its
ugly
face
let
that
be
the
true
meaning
of
let
that
be
the
liberation
we
celebrate
today
liberation
of
the
spirit
that
if
embraced
can
lead
us
all
individuals
and
as
nations
to
be
among
the
righteous
may
god
bless
you
all
and
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
all
those
who
rest
here
good
morning
praise
be
to
god
let
me
begin
by
thanking
the
entire
avenue
baptist
church
family
for
welcoming
our
family
here
today
it
feels
like
family
thank
you
for
making
us
feel
that
way
to
pastor
wheeler
first
lady
wheeler
thank
you
so
much
for
welcoming
us
here
today
congratulations
on
and
have
been
blessed
with
new
nephew
this
year
as
well
so
maybe
at
the
appropriate
time
we
can
make
introductions
now
if
father
is
like
me
then
that
will
be
in
about
years
that
is
great
blessing
and
and
and
are
thrilled
to
be
here
today
and
know
that
sometimes
you
have
to
go
through
little
fuss
to
have
me
as
guest
speaker
so
let
me
in
advance
for
all
the
fuss
we
gather
here
on
sabbath
during
time
of
profound
difficulty
for
our
nation
and
for
our
world
in
such
time
it
soothes
the
soul
to
seek
out
the
divine
in
spirit
of
prayer
to
seek
solace
among
community
of
believers
but
we
are
not
here
just
to
ask
the
lord
for
his
blessing
we
are
here
just
to
interpret
his
scripture
we
also
here
to
call
on
the
memory
of
one
of
his
noble
servants
the
reverend
martin
luther
king
now
it
fitting
that
we
do
so
here
within
the
four
walls
of
avenue
baptist
church
here
in
church
that
rose
like
the
phoenix
from
the
ashes
of
the
civil
war
here
in
church
formed
by
freed
slaves
whose
founding
pastor
had
worn
the
union
blue
here
in
church
from
whose
pews
set
out
for
marches
and
from
whom
choir
anthems
of
freedom
were
heard
from
whose
sanctuary
king
himself
would
from
time
to
time
one
of
those
times
was
thursday
december
pastor
you
said
you
were
little
older
than
me
so
were
you
around
at
that
point
you
were
three
years
old
okay
born
yet
on
thursday
december
and
before
king
had
pointed
us
to
the
before
he
told
us
about
his
dream
in
front
of
the
lincoln
memorial
king
came
here
as
preacher
to
speak
on
what
he
called
the
challenge
of
new
age
the
challenge
of
new
age
it
was
period
of
triumph
but
also
uncertainty
for
king
and
his
followers
because
just
weeks
earlier
the
supreme
court
had
ordered
the
desegregation
of
buses
victory
that
would
put
an
end
to
the
historic
boycott
down
in
alabama
and
yet
as
king
rose
to
take
that
pulpit
the
future
still
seemed
daunting
it
was
clear
what
would
come
next
for
the
movement
that
king
led
it
was
clear
how
we
were
going
to
reach
the
promised
land
because
segregation
was
still
rife
still
fact
yes
the
supreme
court
had
ruled
not
only
on
the
buses
but
also
on
brown
board
of
education
and
yet
that
ruling
was
defied
throughout
the
south
by
schools
and
by
states
they
ignored
it
with
impunity
and
here
in
the
nation
capital
the
federal
government
had
yet
to
fully
align
itself
with
the
laws
on
its
books
and
the
ideals
of
its
founding
so
it
not
hard
for
us
then
to
imagine
that
moment
we
can
imagine
folks
coming
to
this
church
happy
about
the
boycott
being
over
we
can
also
imagine
them
though
coming
here
concerned
about
their
future
sometimes
strategy
maybe
fighting
off
some
creeping
doubts
perhaps
despairing
about
whether
the
movement
in
which
they
had
placed
so
many
of
their
hopes
movement
in
which
they
believed
so
deeply
could
actually
deliver
on
its
promise
so
here
we
are
more
than
half
century
later
once
again
facing
the
challenges
of
new
age
here
we
are
once
more
marching
toward
an
unknown
future
what
call
the
joshua
generation
to
their
moses
generation
the
great
inheritors
of
progress
paid
for
with
sweat
and
blood
and
sometimes
life
itself
we
inherited
the
progress
of
unjust
laws
that
are
now
overturned
we
take
for
granted
the
progress
of
ballot
being
available
to
anybody
who
wants
to
take
the
time
to
actually
vote
we
enjoy
the
fruits
of
prejudice
and
bigotry
being
lifted
slowly
sometimes
in
fits
and
starts
but
irrevocably
from
human
hearts
it
that
progress
that
made
it
possible
for
me
to
be
here
today
for
the
good
people
of
this
country
to
elect
an
african
american
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
reverend
wheeler
mentioned
the
inauguration
last
year
election
you
know
on
the
heels
of
that
victory
over
year
ago
there
were
some
who
suggested
that
somehow
we
had
entered
into
america
all
those
problems
would
be
solved
there
were
those
who
argued
that
because
had
spoke
of
need
for
unity
in
this
country
that
our
nation
was
somehow
entering
into
period
of
that
work
out
so
well
there
was
hope
shared
by
many
that
life
would
be
better
from
the
moment
that
swore
that
oath
of
course
as
we
meet
here
today
one
year
later
we
know
the
promise
of
that
moment
has
not
yet
been
fully
fulfilled
because
of
an
era
of
greed
and
irresponsibility
that
sowed
the
seeds
of
its
own
demise
because
of
persistent
economic
troubles
unaddressed
through
the
generations
because
of
banking
crisis
that
brought
the
financial
system
to
the
brink
of
catastrophe
we
are
being
tested
in
our
own
lives
and
as
nation
as
few
have
been
tested
before
unemployment
is
at
its
highest
level
in
more
than
quarter
of
century
nowhere
is
it
higher
than
the
african
american
community
poverty
is
on
the
rise
home
ownership
is
slipping
beyond
our
shores
our
sons
and
daughters
are
fighting
two
wars
closer
to
home
our
haitian
brothers
and
sisters
are
in
desperate
need
bruised
battered
many
people
are
legitimately
feeling
doubt
even
despair
about
the
future
like
those
who
came
to
this
church
on
that
thursday
in
folks
are
wondering
where
do
we
go
from
here
understand
those
feelings
understand
the
frustration
and
sometimes
anger
that
so
many
folks
feel
as
they
struggle
to
stay
afloat
get
letters
from
folks
around
the
country
every
day
read
night
out
of
the
that
we
receive
and
there
are
stories
of
hardship
and
desperation
in
some
cases
pleading
for
help
need
job
about
to
lose
my
home
do
have
health
care
it
about
to
cause
my
family
to
be
bankrupt
sometimes
you
get
letters
from
children
my
mama
or
my
daddy
have
lost
their
jobs
is
there
something
you
can
do
to
help
ten
letters
like
that
day
we
read
so
yes
we
passing
through
hard
winter
it
the
hardest
in
some
time
but
let
always
remember
that
as
people
the
american
people
we
weathered
some
hard
winters
before
this
country
was
founded
during
some
harsh
winters
the
fishermen
the
the
craftsmen
who
made
camp
at
valley
forge
they
weathered
hard
winter
the
slaves
and
the
who
rode
an
underground
railroad
seeking
the
light
of
justice
under
the
cover
of
night
they
weathered
hard
winter
the
seamstress
whose
feet
were
tired
the
pastor
whose
voice
through
the
ages
they
weathered
some
hard
winters
it
was
for
them
as
it
is
for
us
difficult
in
the
dead
of
winter
to
sometimes
see
spring
coming
they
too
sometimes
felt
their
hopes
deflate
and
yet
each
season
the
frost
melts
the
cold
recedes
the
sun
reappears
so
it
was
for
earlier
generations
and
so
it
will
be
for
us
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
just
ask
what
lessons
we
can
learn
from
those
earlier
generations
about
how
they
sustained
themselves
during
those
hard
winters
how
they
persevered
and
prevailed
let
us
in
this
joshua
generation
learn
how
that
moses
generation
overcame
let
me
offer
few
thoughts
on
this
first
and
foremost
they
did
so
by
remaining
firm
in
their
resolve
despite
being
threatened
by
sniper
fire
or
planted
bombs
by
shoving
and
punching
and
spitting
and
angry
stares
they
adhered
to
that
sweet
spirit
of
resistance
the
principles
of
nonviolence
that
had
accounted
for
their
success
second
they
understood
that
as
much
as
our
government
and
our
political
parties
had
betrayed
them
in
the
past
as
much
as
our
nation
itself
had
betrayed
its
own
ideals
government
if
aligned
with
the
interests
of
its
people
can
be
and
must
be
force
for
good
so
they
stayed
on
the
justice
department
they
went
into
the
courts
they
pressured
congress
they
pressured
their
president
they
give
up
on
this
country
they
give
up
on
government
they
somehow
say
government
was
the
problem
they
said
we
going
to
change
government
we
going
to
make
it
better
imperfect
as
it
was
they
continued
to
believe
in
the
promise
of
democracy
in
america
constant
ability
to
remake
itself
to
perfect
this
union
third
our
predecessors
were
never
so
consumed
with
theoretical
debates
that
they
could
see
progress
when
it
came
sometimes
get
little
frustrated
when
folks
just
do
want
to
see
that
even
if
we
do
get
everything
we
getting
something
king
understood
that
the
desegregation
of
the
armed
forces
end
the
civil
rights
movement
because
black
and
white
soldiers
still
could
sit
together
at
the
same
lunch
counter
when
they
came
home
but
he
still
insisted
on
the
rightness
of
the
armed
forces
that
was
good
first
step
even
as
he
called
for
more
he
suggest
that
somehow
by
the
signing
of
the
civil
rights
that
somehow
all
discrimination
would
end
but
he
also
think
that
we
sign
the
civil
rights
act
because
it
solved
every
problem
let
take
victory
he
said
and
then
keep
on
marching
forward
steps
large
and
small
were
for
what
they
were
which
was
progress
fourth
at
the
core
of
king
success
was
an
appeal
to
conscience
that
touched
hearts
and
opened
minds
commitment
to
universal
ideals
of
freedom
of
justice
of
equality
that
spoke
to
all
people
not
just
some
people
for
king
understood
that
without
broad
support
any
movement
for
civil
rights
could
not
be
sustained
that
why
he
marched
with
the
white
auto
worker
in
detroit
that
why
he
linked
arm
with
the
mexican
farm
worker
in
california
and
united
people
of
all
in
the
noble
quest
for
freedom
of
course
king
overcame
in
other
ways
as
well
he
remained
strategically
focused
on
gaining
ground
his
eyes
on
the
prize
constantly
understanding
that
change
would
not
be
easy
understand
that
change
would
come
overnight
understanding
that
there
would
be
setbacks
and
false
starts
along
the
way
but
understanding
as
he
said
in
that
we
can
walk
and
never
get
weary
because
we
know
there
is
great
camp
meeting
in
the
promised
land
of
freedom
and
justice
and
it
because
the
moses
generation
overcame
that
the
trials
we
face
today
are
very
different
from
the
ones
that
tested
us
in
previous
generations
even
after
the
worst
recession
in
generations
life
in
america
is
not
even
close
to
being
as
brutal
as
it
was
back
then
for
so
many
that
the
legacy
of
king
and
his
movement
that
our
inheritance
having
said
that
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
challenges
of
our
new
age
are
serious
in
their
own
right
and
we
must
face
them
as
squarely
as
they
faced
the
challenges
they
saw
know
it
been
hard
road
we
this
year
to
rescue
the
economy
but
the
economy
is
growing
again
the
job
losses
have
finally
slowed
and
around
the
country
there
signs
that
businesses
and
families
are
beginning
to
rebound
we
are
making
progress
know
it
been
hard
road
that
we
to
reach
this
point
on
health
reform
promise
you
know
but
under
the
legislation
will
sign
into
law
insurance
companies
be
able
to
drop
you
when
you
get
sick
and
more
than
million
people
our
fellow
americans
will
finally
have
insurance
more
than
million
men
and
women
and
children
mothers
and
fathers
be
worried
about
what
might
happen
to
them
if
they
get
sick
this
will
be
victory
not
for
democrats
this
will
be
victory
for
dignity
and
decency
for
our
common
humanity
this
will
be
victory
for
the
united
states
of
america
let
work
to
change
the
political
system
as
imperfect
as
it
is
know
people
can
feel
down
about
the
way
things
are
going
sometimes
here
in
washington
know
it
tempting
to
give
up
on
the
political
process
but
we
put
in
place
tougher
rules
on
lobbying
and
ethics
and
transparency
tougher
rules
than
any
administration
in
history
it
not
enough
but
it
progress
progress
is
possible
do
give
up
on
voting
do
give
up
on
advocacy
do
give
up
on
activism
there
are
too
many
needs
to
be
met
too
much
work
to
be
done
like
king
said
we
must
accept
finite
disappointment
but
never
lose
infinite
hope
let
us
broaden
our
coalition
building
confederation
not
of
liberals
or
conservatives
not
of
red
states
or
blue
states
but
of
all
americans
who
are
hurting
today
and
searching
for
better
tomorrow
the
urgency
of
the
hour
demands
that
we
make
common
cause
with
all
of
america
workers
white
black
brown
all
of
whom
are
being
hammered
by
this
recession
all
of
whom
are
yearning
for
that
spring
to
come
it
demands
that
we
reach
out
to
those
who
been
left
out
in
the
cold
even
when
the
economy
is
good
even
when
we
not
in
recession
the
youth
in
the
inner
cities
the
youth
here
in
washington
people
in
rural
communities
who
have
seen
prosperity
reach
them
for
very
long
time
it
demands
that
we
fight
discrimination
whatever
form
it
may
come
that
means
we
fight
discrimination
against
gays
and
lesbians
and
we
make
common
cause
to
reform
our
immigration
system
and
finally
we
have
to
as
king
did
that
progress
just
come
from
without
it
also
has
to
come
from
within
and
over
the
past
year
for
example
we
made
meaningful
improvements
in
the
field
of
education
got
terrific
secretary
of
education
he
been
working
hard
with
states
and
working
hard
with
the
school
district
and
we
insisted
on
reform
and
we
insisted
on
accountability
we
we
putting
in
more
money
and
we
provided
more
grants
and
more
tuition
tax
credits
and
simpler
financial
aid
forms
we
done
all
that
but
parents
still
need
to
parent
kids
still
need
to
own
up
to
their
responsibilities
we
still
have
to
set
high
expectations
for
our
young
people
folks
simply
look
to
government
for
all
the
answers
without
also
looking
inside
themselves
inside
their
own
homes
for
some
of
the
answers
progress
will
only
come
if
we
willing
to
promote
that
ethic
of
hard
work
sense
of
responsibility
in
our
own
lives
not
talking
by
the
way
just
to
the
african
american
community
sometimes
when
say
these
things
people
well
he
just
talking
to
black
people
about
working
hard
no
no
no
no
talking
to
the
american
community
because
somewhere
along
the
way
we
as
nation
began
to
lose
touch
with
some
of
our
core
values
you
know
what
talking
about
we
became
enraptured
with
the
false
prophets
who
an
easy
path
to
success
paved
with
credit
cards
and
home
equity
loans
and
schemes
and
the
most
important
thing
was
to
be
celebrity
it
matter
what
you
do
as
long
as
you
get
on
that
everybody
we
forgot
what
made
the
bus
boycott
success
what
made
the
civil
rights
movement
success
what
made
the
united
states
of
america
success
that
in
this
country
there
no
substitute
for
hard
work
no
substitute
for
job
well
done
no
substitute
for
being
responsible
stewards
of
god
blessings
what
we
called
to
do
then
is
rebuild
america
from
its
foundation
on
up
to
reinvest
in
the
essentials
that
we
neglected
for
too
long
like
health
care
like
education
like
better
energy
policy
like
basic
infrastructure
like
scientific
research
our
generation
is
called
to
buckle
down
and
get
back
to
basics
we
must
do
so
not
only
for
ourselves
but
also
for
our
children
and
their
children
for
and
for
that
sacrifice
that
falls
on
us
to
make
it
much
smaller
sacrifice
than
the
moses
generation
had
to
make
but
it
still
sacrifice
yes
it
hard
to
transition
to
clean
energy
economy
sometimes
it
may
be
inconvenient
but
it
sacrifice
that
we
have
to
make
it
hard
to
be
fiscally
responsible
when
we
have
all
these
human
needs
and
we
inheriting
enormous
deficits
and
debt
but
that
sacrifice
that
we
going
to
have
to
make
you
know
it
easy
after
hard
day
work
to
just
put
your
kid
in
front
of
the
set
you
tired
do
want
to
fuss
with
them
instead
of
reading
to
them
but
that
sacrifice
we
must
joyfully
accept
sometimes
it
hard
to
be
good
father
and
good
mother
sometimes
it
hard
to
be
good
or
good
citizen
to
give
up
time
in
service
of
others
to
give
something
of
ourselves
to
cause
that
greater
than
ourselves
as
and
are
urging
folks
to
do
tomorrow
to
and
celebrate
king
but
these
are
sacrifices
that
we
are
called
to
make
these
are
sacrifices
that
our
faith
calls
us
to
make
our
faith
in
the
future
our
faith
in
america
our
faith
in
god
and
on
his
sermon
all
those
years
ago
king
quoted
poet
verse
truth
forever
on
the
scaffold
wrong
forever
on
the
and
behind
the
dim
unknown
stands
god
within
the
shadows
keeping
watch
above
his
own
even
as
king
stood
in
this
church
victory
in
the
past
and
uncertainty
in
the
future
he
trusted
god
he
trusted
that
god
would
make
way
way
for
prayers
to
be
answered
way
for
our
union
to
be
perfected
way
for
the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
no
matter
how
long
to
slowly
bend
towards
truth
and
bend
towards
freedom
to
bend
towards
justice
he
had
faith
that
god
would
make
way
out
of
no
way
you
know
folks
ask
me
sometimes
why
look
so
calm
they
say
all
this
stuff
coming
at
you
how
come
you
just
seem
calm
and
have
confession
to
make
here
there
are
times
where
not
so
calm
love
knows
my
wife
knows
there
are
times
when
progress
seems
too
slow
there
are
times
when
the
words
that
are
spoken
about
me
hurt
there
are
times
when
the
barbs
sting
there
are
times
when
it
feels
like
all
these
efforts
are
for
naught
and
change
is
so
painfully
slow
in
coming
and
have
to
confront
my
own
doubts
but
let
me
tell
you
during
those
times
it
faith
that
keeps
me
calm
it
faith
that
gives
me
peace
the
same
faith
that
leads
single
mother
to
work
two
jobs
to
put
roof
over
her
head
when
she
has
doubts
the
same
faith
that
keeps
an
unemployed
father
to
keep
on
submitting
job
applications
even
after
he
been
rejected
hundred
times
the
same
faith
that
says
to
teacher
even
if
the
first
nine
children
she
teaching
she
reach
that
that
one
she
going
to
be
able
to
reach
the
same
faith
that
breaks
the
silence
of
an
earthquake
wake
with
the
sound
of
prayers
and
hymns
sung
by
haitian
community
faith
in
things
not
seen
in
better
days
ahead
in
him
who
holds
the
future
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
faith
that
lets
us
mount
up
on
wings
like
eagles
lets
us
run
and
not
be
weary
lets
us
walk
and
not
faint
so
let
us
hold
fast
to
that
faith
as
joshua
held
fast
to
the
faith
of
his
fathers
and
together
we
shall
overcome
the
challenges
of
new
age
together
we
shall
seize
the
promise
of
this
moment
together
we
shall
make
way
through
winter
and
we
going
to
welcome
the
spring
through
god
all
things
are
possible
may
the
memory
of
martin
luther
king
continue
to
inspire
us
and
ennoble
our
world
and
all
who
inhabit
it
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
thank
you
everybody
for
being
here
as
we
all
know
our
country
has
endured
the
deepest
recession
we
faced
in
generations
and
much
of
the
turmoil
was
caused
by
irresponsibility
on
the
part
of
banks
and
financial
institutions
firms
took
reckless
risks
in
pursuit
of
profits
and
soaring
bonuses
triggering
financial
crisis
that
nearly
pulled
the
economy
into
second
great
depression
it
was
little
more
than
year
ago
that
we
stood
on
that
precipice
several
of
the
world
largest
financial
institutions
had
already
failed
credit
markets
froze
and
banks
refused
to
lend
trillions
of
dollars
in
household
savings
evaporated
as
stocks
pensions
and
home
values
plummeted
and
we
were
losing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
each
month
it
was
at
this
time
that
many
large
financial
firms
those
left
standing
teetered
on
the
brink
of
collapse
overwhelmed
by
the
consequences
of
their
irresponsible
decisions
now
even
though
these
firms
were
largely
facing
crisis
of
their
own
making
their
failure
could
have
led
to
an
even
greater
calamity
for
the
country
so
the
federal
reserve
and
other
agencies
took
emergency
measures
to
prevent
that
outcome
and
the
previous
administration
started
program
the
troubled
asset
relief
program
or
to
provide
these
financial
institutions
with
funds
to
survive
the
turmoil
that
they
had
helped
unleash
it
was
distasteful
but
necessary
thing
to
do
now
we
worked
over
the
last
year
to
manage
this
program
effectively
to
hold
firms
accountable
and
to
recoup
as
much
tax
money
as
possible
many
originally
feared
that
most
of
the
billion
dollars
in
money
would
be
lost
but
because
of
the
management
of
this
program
by
secretary
and
my
economic
team
we
now
recovered
the
majority
of
the
funds
provided
to
banks
as
far
as
concerned
however
that
not
good
enough
my
commitment
is
to
the
taxpayer
my
commitment
is
to
recover
every
single
dime
the
american
people
are
owed
and
my
determination
to
achieve
this
goal
is
only
heightened
when
see
reports
of
massive
profits
and
obscene
bonuses
at
some
of
the
very
firms
who
owe
their
continued
existence
to
the
american
people
folks
who
have
not
been
made
whole
and
who
continue
to
face
real
hardship
in
this
recession
we
want
our
money
back
and
we
going
to
get
it
and
that
why
proposing
financial
crisis
responsibility
fee
to
be
imposed
on
major
financial
firms
until
the
american
people
are
fully
compensated
for
the
extraordinary
assistance
they
provided
to
wall
street
if
these
companies
are
in
good
enough
shape
to
afford
massive
bonuses
they
are
surely
in
good
enough
shape
to
afford
paying
back
every
penny
to
taxpayers
now
our
estimate
is
that
the
program
will
end
up
costing
taxpayers
around
billion
dollars
obviously
lot
less
than
the
billion
that
people
had
feared
but
still
lot
of
money
the
fee
will
be
in
place
for
years
or
as
long
as
it
takes
to
raise
the
full
amount
necessary
to
cover
all
taxpayer
losses
this
will
not
be
cost
borne
by
community
banks
or
small
financial
firms
only
the
largest
firms
with
more
than
billion
dollars
in
assets
will
be
affected
and
the
size
of
the
fee
each
bank
owes
will
be
based
on
its
size
and
exposure
to
debt
so
that
we
are
recovering
tax
dollars
while
promoting
reform
of
the
banking
practices
that
contributed
to
this
crisis
now
the
fact
is
these
financial
institutions
are
essential
to
our
economy
they
provide
capital
and
credit
to
families
purchasing
homes
students
attending
college
businesses
seeking
to
start
up
or
expand
and
that
why
the
rescue
program
was
as
necessary
as
it
was
unfortunate
and
that
is
why
through
this
fee
and
broader
reforms
that
we
seek
our
goal
is
not
to
punish
wall
street
firms
but
rather
to
prevent
the
abuse
and
excess
that
nearly
caused
the
collapse
of
many
of
these
firms
and
the
financial
system
itself
we
can
not
go
back
to
business
as
usual
and
when
we
see
reports
of
firms
once
again
engaging
in
risky
bets
to
reap
quick
rewards
when
we
see
return
to
compensation
practices
that
seem
not
to
reflect
what
the
country
has
been
through
all
that
looks
like
business
as
usual
to
me
the
financial
industry
has
even
launched
massive
lobbying
campaign
locking
arms
with
the
opposition
party
to
stand
in
the
way
of
reforms
to
prevent
another
crisis
that
too
unfortunately
is
business
as
usual
and
we
already
hearing
hue
and
cry
from
wall
street
suggesting
that
this
proposed
fee
is
not
only
unwelcome
but
unfair
that
by
some
twisted
logic
it
is
more
appropriate
for
the
american
people
to
bear
the
costs
of
the
bailout
rather
than
the
industry
that
benefited
from
it
even
though
these
executives
are
out
there
giving
themselves
huge
bonuses
what
say
to
these
executives
is
this
instead
of
sending
phalanx
of
lobbyists
to
fight
this
proposal
or
employing
an
army
of
lawyers
and
accountants
to
help
evade
the
fee
suggest
you
might
want
to
consider
simply
meeting
your
responsibilities
and
urge
you
to
cover
the
costs
of
the
rescue
not
by
sticking
it
to
your
shareholders
or
your
customers
or
fellow
citizens
with
the
bill
but
by
rolling
back
bonuses
for
top
earners
and
executives
and
more
broadly
am
continuing
to
call
on
these
firms
to
put
greater
effort
into
helping
families
stay
in
their
homes
to
provide
small
businesses
with
needed
loans
and
to
embrace
rather
than
fight
serious
financial
reform
ultimately
it
is
by
taking
responsibility
on
wall
street
here
in
washington
all
the
way
to
main
street
that
we
going
to
move
past
this
period
of
turmoil
that
how
we
going
to
avoid
the
cycles
of
boom
and
bust
that
have
caused
so
much
havoc
that
how
we
going
to
promote
vibrant
markets
that
reward
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
and
hard
work
that
how
we
going
to
create
sustained
growth
without
the
looming
threat
of
another
costly
crisis
that
not
only
in
the
best
interests
of
the
economy
as
whole
it
actually
in
the
interest
of
these
large
banks
so
going
to
be
working
closely
with
congress
on
this
proposal
and
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
look
forward
to
signing
it
into
law
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
the
immediate
that
ordered
after
the
failed
terrorist
attack
are
now
complete
was
just
briefed
on
the
findings
and
recommendations
for
reform
and
believe
it
important
that
the
american
people
understand
the
new
steps
that
we
taking
to
prevent
attacks
and
keep
our
country
safe
this
afternoon
my
and
homeland
security
john
will
discuss
his
review
into
our
terrorist
system
how
our
government
failed
to
connect
the
dots
in
way
that
would
have
prevented
known
terrorist
from
boarding
plane
for
america
and
the
steps
we
going
to
take
to
prevent
that
from
happening
again
secretary
of
homeland
security
will
discuss
her
review
of
aviation
screening
technology
and
procedures
how
that
terrorist
boarded
plane
with
explosives
that
could
have
killed
nearly
innocent
people
and
how
we
strengthen
aviation
security
going
forward
so
today
want
to
just
briefly
their
conclusions
and
the
steps
that
ordered
to
address
them
in
our
world
america
first
line
of
is
timely
accurate
intelligence
that
is
shared
integrated
and
acted
upon
quickly
and
effectively
that
what
the
intelligence
reforms
after
the
attacks
largely
achieved
that
what
our
intelligence
community
does
every
day
but
unfortunately
that
not
what
happened
in
the
to
day
it
now
clear
that
shortcomings
occurred
in
three
broad
and
compounding
ways
first
although
our
intelligence
community
had
learned
great
deal
about
the
affiliate
in
yemen
called
in
the
arabian
peninsula
that
we
knew
that
they
sought
to
strike
the
united
states
and
that
they
were
recruiting
operatives
to
do
so
the
intelligence
community
did
not
aggressively
follow
up
on
and
particular
streams
of
intelligence
related
to
possible
attack
against
the
homeland
second
this
contributed
to
larger
failure
of
analysis
failure
to
connect
the
dots
of
intelligence
that
existed
across
our
intelligence
community
and
which
together
could
have
revealed
that
was
planning
an
attack
third
this
in
turn
fed
into
shortcomings
in
the
system
which
resulted
in
this
person
not
being
placed
on
the
no
fly
list
thereby
allowing
him
to
board
that
plane
in
for
detroit
in
sum
the
government
had
the
information
scattered
throughout
the
system
to
potentially
uncover
this
plot
and
disrupt
the
attack
rather
than
failure
to
collect
or
share
intelligence
this
was
failure
to
connect
and
understand
the
intelligence
that
we
already
had
that
why
we
took
swift
action
in
the
immediate
days
following
including
reviewing
and
updating
the
terrorist
system
and
adding
more
individuals
to
the
no
fly
list
and
directing
our
embassies
and
consulates
to
include
current
visa
information
in
their
warnings
of
individuals
with
terrorist
or
suspected
terrorist
ties
today
directing
series
of
additional
corrective
steps
across
multiple
agencies
broadly
speaking
they
fall
into
four
areas
first
directing
that
our
intelligence
community
immediately
begin
assigning
specific
responsibility
for
investigating
all
leads
on
threats
so
that
these
leads
are
pursued
and
acted
upon
aggressively
not
just
most
of
the
time
but
all
of
the
time
we
must
follow
the
leads
that
we
get
and
we
must
pursue
them
until
plots
are
disrupted
and
that
mean
assigning
clear
lines
of
responsibility
second
directing
that
intelligence
reports
especially
those
involving
potential
threats
to
the
united
states
be
distributed
more
rapidly
and
more
widely
we
sit
on
information
that
could
protect
the
american
people
third
directing
that
we
strengthen
the
analytical
process
how
our
analysis
how
our
analysts
process
and
integrate
the
intelligence
that
they
receive
my
director
of
national
intelligence
will
take
the
lead
in
improving
our
efforts
my
intelligence
advisory
board
will
examine
the
challenge
of
sifting
through
vast
universes
of
intelligence
and
data
in
our
information
age
and
finally
ordering
an
immediate
effort
to
strengthen
the
criteria
used
to
add
individuals
to
our
terrorist
especially
the
no
fly
list
we
must
do
better
in
keeping
dangerous
people
off
while
still
facilitating
air
travel
so
taken
together
these
reforms
will
improve
the
intelligence
community
ability
to
collect
share
integrate
and
act
on
intelligence
swiftly
and
effectively
in
short
they
will
help
our
intelligence
community
do
its
job
even
better
and
protect
american
lives
but
even
the
best
intelligence
identify
in
advance
every
individual
who
would
do
us
harm
so
we
need
the
security
at
our
airports
ports
and
borders
and
through
our
partnerships
with
other
nations
to
prevent
terrorists
from
entering
america
at
the
airport
was
subjected
to
the
same
screening
as
other
passengers
he
was
required
to
show
his
documents
including
valid
visa
his
bag
was
he
passed
through
metal
detector
but
metal
detector
detect
the
kind
of
explosives
that
were
sewn
into
his
clothes
as
secretary
will
explain
the
screening
technologies
that
might
have
detected
these
explosives
are
in
use
at
the
airport
but
not
at
the
specific
checkpoints
that
he
passed
through
indeed
most
airports
in
the
world
and
in
the
united
states
do
not
yet
have
these
technologies
now
there
no
silver
bullet
to
securing
the
thousands
of
flights
into
america
each
day
domestic
and
international
it
will
require
significant
investments
in
many
areas
and
that
why
even
before
the
attack
we
increased
investments
in
homeland
security
and
aviation
security
this
includes
an
additional
one
billion
dollars
in
new
systems
and
technologies
that
we
need
to
protect
our
airports
more
baggage
screening
more
passenger
screening
and
more
advanced
explosive
detection
capabilities
including
those
that
can
improve
our
ability
to
detect
the
kind
of
explosive
used
on
these
are
major
investments
and
they
make
our
skies
safer
and
more
secure
as
announced
this
week
we
taken
whole
range
of
steps
to
improve
aviation
screening
and
security
since
including
new
rules
for
how
we
handle
visas
within
the
government
and
enhanced
screening
for
passengers
flying
from
or
through
certain
countries
and
today
directing
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
take
additional
steps
including
strengthening
our
international
partnerships
to
improve
aviation
screening
and
security
around
the
world
greater
use
of
the
advanced
explosive
detection
technologies
that
we
already
have
including
imaging
technology
and
working
aggressively
in
cooperation
with
the
department
of
energy
and
our
national
labs
to
develop
and
deploy
the
next
generation
of
screening
technologies
now
there
is
of
course
no
foolproof
solution
as
we
develop
new
screening
technologies
and
procedures
our
adversaries
will
seek
new
ways
to
evade
them
as
was
shown
by
the
attack
in
the
race
to
protect
our
country
we
have
to
stay
one
step
ahead
of
nimble
adversary
that
what
these
steps
are
designed
to
do
and
we
will
continue
to
work
with
congress
to
ensure
that
our
intelligence
homeland
security
and
law
enforcement
communities
have
the
resources
they
need
to
keep
the
american
people
safe
ordered
these
two
immediate
reviews
so
that
we
could
take
immediate
action
to
secure
our
country
but
in
the
weeks
and
months
ahead
we
will
continue
sustained
and
intensive
effort
of
analysis
and
assessment
so
that
we
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
seeking
better
ways
to
protect
the
american
people
have
repeatedly
made
it
clear
in
public
with
the
american
people
and
in
private
with
my
national
security
team
that
will
hold
my
staff
our
agencies
and
the
people
in
them
accountable
when
they
fail
to
perform
their
responsibilities
at
the
highest
levels
now
at
this
stage
in
the
review
process
it
appears
that
this
incident
was
not
the
fault
of
single
individual
or
but
rather
systemic
failure
across
and
agencies
that
why
in
addition
to
the
corrective
efforts
that
ordered
directed
agency
heads
to
establish
internal
accountability
reviews
and
directed
my
national
security
staff
to
monitor
their
efforts
we
will
measure
progress
and
john
will
report
back
to
me
within
days
and
on
regular
basis
after
that
all
of
these
agencies
and
their
leaders
are
responsible
for
implementing
these
reforms
and
all
will
be
held
accountable
if
they
do
moreover
am
less
interested
in
passing
out
blame
than
am
in
learning
from
and
correcting
these
mistakes
to
make
us
safer
for
ultimately
the
buck
stops
with
me
as
president
have
solemn
responsibility
to
protect
our
nation
and
our
people
and
when
the
system
fails
it
is
my
responsibility
over
the
past
two
weeks
we
been
reminded
again
of
the
challenge
we
face
in
protecting
our
country
against
foe
that
is
bent
on
our
destruction
and
while
passions
and
politics
can
often
obscure
the
hard
work
before
us
let
be
clear
about
what
this
moment
demands
we
are
at
war
we
are
at
war
against
network
of
violence
and
hatred
that
attacked
us
on
that
killed
nearly
innocent
people
and
that
is
plotting
to
strike
us
again
and
we
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
defeat
them
and
we
made
progress
leadership
is
down
we
have
worked
closely
with
partners
including
yemen
to
inflict
major
blows
against
leaders
and
we
have
disrupted
plots
at
home
and
abroad
and
saved
american
lives
and
we
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
muslims
reject
but
it
is
clear
that
increasingly
seeks
to
recruit
individuals
without
known
terrorist
affiliations
not
just
in
the
middle
east
but
in
africa
and
other
places
to
do
their
bidding
that
why
directed
my
national
security
team
to
develop
strategy
that
addresses
the
unique
challenges
posed
by
lone
recruits
and
that
why
we
must
communicate
clearly
to
muslims
around
the
world
that
offers
nothing
except
bankrupt
vision
of
misery
and
death
including
the
murder
of
fellow
muslims
while
the
united
states
stands
with
those
who
seek
justice
and
progress
to
advance
that
progress
we
sought
new
beginnings
with
muslim
communities
around
the
world
one
in
which
we
engage
on
the
basis
of
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
work
together
to
the
aspirations
that
all
people
share
to
get
an
education
to
work
with
dignity
to
live
in
peace
and
security
that
what
america
believes
in
that
the
vision
that
is
far
more
powerful
than
the
hatred
of
these
violent
extremists
here
at
home
we
will
strengthen
our
defenses
but
we
will
not
succumb
to
siege
mentality
that
sacrifices
the
open
society
and
liberties
and
values
that
we
cherish
as
americans
because
great
and
proud
nations
do
down
and
hide
behind
walls
of
suspicion
and
mistrust
that
is
exactly
what
our
adversaries
want
and
so
long
as
am
president
we
will
never
hand
them
that
victory
we
will
define
the
character
of
our
country
not
some
band
of
small
men
intent
on
killing
innocent
men
women
and
children
and
in
this
cause
every
one
of
us
every
american
every
elected
official
can
do
our
part
instead
of
giving
into
cynicism
and
division
let
move
forward
with
the
confidence
and
optimism
and
unity
that
defines
us
as
people
for
now
is
not
time
for
partisanship
it
time
for
citizenship
time
to
come
together
and
work
together
with
the
seriousness
of
purpose
that
our
national
security
demands
that
what
it
means
to
be
strong
in
the
face
of
violent
extremism
that
how
we
will
prevail
in
this
fight
and
that
how
we
will
protect
our
country
and
pass
it
safer
and
stronger
to
the
next
generation
thanks
very
much
just
concluded
meeting
with
members
of
my
national
security
team
including
those
from
our
intelligence
homeland
security
and
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
in
the
security
reviews
that
ordered
after
the
failed
attack
on
day
called
these
leaders
to
the
white
house
because
we
face
challenge
of
the
utmost
urgency
as
we
saw
on
and
its
extremist
allies
will
stop
at
nothing
in
their
efforts
to
kill
americans
and
we
are
determined
not
only
to
thwart
those
plans
but
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
their
networks
once
and
for
all
indeed
over
the
past
year
we
taken
the
fight
to
and
its
allies
wherever
they
plot
and
train
be
it
in
and
pakistan
in
yemen
and
somalia
or
in
other
countries
around
the
world
here
at
home
our
intelligence
homeland
security
and
law
enforcement
agencies
have
worked
together
with
considerable
success
gathering
intelligence
stitching
it
together
and
making
arrests
from
denver
to
texas
from
illinois
to
new
york
disrupting
plots
and
saving
american
lives
and
these
successes
have
not
come
without
price
as
we
saw
last
week
in
the
loss
of
our
courageous
officers
in
but
when
suspected
terrorist
is
able
to
board
plane
with
explosives
on
day
the
system
has
failed
in
potentially
disastrous
way
and
it
my
responsibility
to
find
out
why
and
to
correct
that
failure
so
that
we
can
prevent
such
attacks
in
the
future
and
that
why
shortly
after
the
attempted
bombing
over
detroit
ordered
two
reviews
directed
secretary
of
homeland
security
to
review
aviation
screening
technology
and
procedures
she
briefed
me
on
her
initial
findings
today
and
pleased
that
this
review
is
drawing
on
the
best
science
and
technology
including
the
expertise
of
secretary
of
energy
and
his
department
also
directed
my
and
homeland
security
john
to
lead
thorough
review
into
our
terrorist
system
so
we
can
fix
what
went
wrong
as
we
discussed
today
this
ongoing
review
continues
to
reveal
more
about
the
human
and
systemic
failures
that
almost
cost
nearly
lives
we
will
make
summary
of
this
preliminary
report
public
within
the
next
few
days
but
let
me
share
some
of
what
we
know
so
far
as
described
over
the
weekend
elements
of
our
intelligence
community
knew
that
had
to
yemen
and
joined
up
with
extremists
there
it
now
turns
out
that
our
intelligence
community
knew
of
other
red
flags
that
in
the
arabian
peninsula
sought
to
strike
not
only
american
targets
in
yemen
but
the
united
states
itself
and
we
had
information
that
this
group
was
working
with
an
individual
who
was
known
who
we
now
know
was
in
fact
the
individual
involved
in
the
attack
the
bottom
line
is
this
the
government
had
sufficient
information
to
have
uncovered
this
plot
and
potentially
disrupt
the
day
attack
but
our
intelligence
community
failed
to
connect
those
dots
which
would
have
placed
the
suspect
on
the
no
fly
list
in
other
words
this
was
not
failure
to
collect
intelligence
it
was
failure
to
integrate
and
understand
the
intelligence
that
we
already
had
the
information
was
there
agencies
and
analysts
who
needed
it
had
access
to
it
and
our
professionals
were
trained
to
look
for
it
and
to
bring
it
all
together
now
will
accept
that
intelligence
by
its
nature
is
imperfect
but
it
is
increasingly
clear
that
intelligence
was
not
fully
or
fully
leveraged
that
not
acceptable
and
will
not
tolerate
it
time
and
again
we
learned
that
quickly
piecing
together
information
and
taking
swift
action
is
critical
to
staying
one
step
ahead
of
nimble
adversary
so
we
have
to
do
better
and
we
will
do
better
and
we
have
to
do
it
quickly
american
lives
are
on
the
line
so
made
it
clear
today
to
my
team
want
our
initial
reviews
completed
this
week
want
specific
recommendations
for
corrective
actions
to
fix
what
went
wrong
want
those
reforms
implemented
immediately
so
that
this
does
happen
again
and
so
we
can
prevent
future
attacks
and
know
that
every
member
of
my
team
that
met
with
today
understands
the
urgency
of
getting
this
right
and
appreciate
that
each
of
them
took
responsibility
for
the
shortfalls
within
their
own
agencies
immediately
after
the
attack
ordered
concrete
steps
to
protect
the
american
people
new
screening
and
security
for
all
flights
domestic
and
international
more
explosive
detection
teams
at
airports
more
air
marshals
on
flights
and
deepening
cooperation
with
international
partners
in
recent
days
we
taken
additional
steps
to
improve
security
officials
have
reviewed
and
updated
our
terrorist
watch
list
system
including
adding
more
individuals
to
the
no
fly
list
and
while
our
review
has
found
that
our
system
is
not
broken
the
failure
to
add
to
the
no
fly
list
shows
that
this
system
needs
to
be
strengthened
the
state
department
is
now
requiring
embassies
and
consulates
to
include
current
visa
information
in
their
warning
on
individuals
with
terrorist
or
suspected
terrorist
connections
as
of
yesterday
the
transportation
security
administration
or
is
requiring
enhanced
screening
for
passengers
flying
into
the
united
states
from
or
flying
through
nations
on
our
list
of
state
sponsors
of
terrorism
or
other
countries
of
interest
and
in
the
days
ahead
will
announce
further
steps
to
disrupt
attacks
including
better
integration
of
information
and
enhanced
passenger
screening
for
air
travel
finally
some
have
suggested
that
the
events
on
day
should
cause
us
to
revisit
the
decision
to
close
the
prison
at
bay
so
let
me
be
clear
it
was
always
our
intent
to
transfer
detainees
to
other
countries
only
under
conditions
that
provide
assurances
that
our
security
is
being
protected
with
respect
to
yemen
in
particular
there
an
ongoing
security
situation
which
we
have
been
confronting
for
some
time
along
with
our
partner
given
the
unsettled
situation
spoken
to
the
attorney
general
and
we
agreed
that
we
will
not
be
transferring
additional
detainees
back
to
yemen
at
this
time
but
make
no
mistake
we
will
close
prison
which
has
damaged
our
national
security
interests
and
become
tremendous
recruiting
tool
for
in
fact
that
was
an
explicit
rationale
for
the
formation
of
in
the
arabian
peninsula
and
as
always
said
we
will
do
so
we
will
close
the
prison
in
manner
that
keeps
the
american
people
safe
and
secure
our
reviews
and
the
steps
that
we
taken
and
will
continue
to
take
go
to
the
heart
of
the
kind
of
intelligence
and
homeland
security
we
need
in
the
century
just
as
and
its
allies
are
constantly
evolving
and
adapting
their
efforts
to
strike
us
we
have
to
constantly
adapt
and
evolve
to
defeat
them
because
as
we
saw
on
the
margin
for
error
is
slim
and
the
consequences
of
failure
can
be
catastrophic
as
these
violent
extremists
pursue
new
havens
we
intend
to
target
wherever
they
take
root
forging
new
partnerships
to
deny
them
sanctuary
as
we
are
doing
currently
with
the
government
in
yemen
as
our
adversaries
seek
new
recruits
we
constantly
review
and
rapidly
update
our
intelligence
and
our
institutions
as
they
refine
our
tactics
we
enhance
our
defenses
including
smarter
screening
and
security
at
airports
and
investing
in
the
technologies
that
might
have
detected
the
kind
of
explosives
used
on
in
short
we
need
our
intelligence
homeland
security
and
law
enforcement
systems
and
the
people
in
them
to
be
accountable
and
to
work
as
intended
collecting
sharing
integrating
and
acting
on
intelligence
as
quickly
and
effectively
as
possible
to
save
innocent
lives
not
just
most
of
the
time
but
all
the
time
that
what
the
american
people
deserve
as
president
that
exactly
what
will
demand
thank
you
very
much
good
morning
everybody
wanted
to
take
just
few
minutes
to
update
the
american
people
on
the
attempted
terrorist
attack
that
occurred
on
day
and
the
steps
we
taking
to
ensure
the
safety
and
security
of
the
country
the
investigation
ongoing
and
spoke
again
this
morning
with
attorney
general
holder
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
and
my
and
homeland
security
adviser
john
asked
them
to
keep
continue
monitoring
the
situation
to
keep
the
american
people
and
members
of
congress
informed
now
here
what
we
know
so
far
on
day
airlines
flight
was
route
from
to
detroit
as
the
plane
made
its
final
approach
to
detroit
metropolitan
airport
passenger
allegedly
tried
to
ignite
an
explosive
device
on
his
body
setting
off
fire
thanks
to
the
quick
and
heroic
actions
of
passengers
and
crew
the
suspect
was
immediately
subdued
the
fire
was
put
out
and
the
plane
landed
safely
the
suspect
is
now
in
custody
and
has
been
charged
with
attempting
to
destroy
an
aircraft
and
full
investigation
has
been
launched
into
this
attempted
act
of
terrorism
and
we
will
not
rest
until
we
find
all
who
were
involved
and
hold
them
accountable
now
this
was
serious
reminder
of
the
dangers
that
we
face
and
the
nature
of
those
who
threaten
our
homeland
had
the
suspect
succeeded
in
bringing
down
that
plane
it
could
have
killed
nearly
passengers
and
crew
innocent
civilians
preparing
to
celebrate
the
holidays
with
their
families
and
friends
the
american
people
should
be
assured
that
we
are
doing
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
you
and
your
family
safe
and
secure
during
this
busy
holiday
season
since
was
first
notified
of
this
incident
ordered
the
following
actions
to
be
taken
to
protect
the
american
people
and
to
secure
air
travel
first
directed
that
we
take
immediate
steps
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
public
we
made
sure
that
all
flights
still
in
the
air
were
secure
and
could
land
safely
we
immediately
enhanced
screening
and
security
procedures
for
all
flights
domestic
and
international
we
added
federal
air
marshals
to
flights
entering
and
leaving
the
united
states
and
we
working
closely
in
this
country
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
with
our
international
partners
second
ordered
two
important
because
it
absolutely
critical
that
we
learn
from
this
incident
and
take
the
necessary
measures
to
prevent
future
acts
of
terrorism
the
first
review
involves
our
watch
list
system
which
our
government
has
had
in
place
for
many
years
to
identify
known
and
suspected
terrorists
so
that
we
can
prevent
their
entry
into
the
united
states
apparently
the
suspect
in
the
incident
was
in
this
system
but
not
on
watch
list
such
as
the
list
so
have
ordered
thorough
review
not
only
of
how
information
related
to
the
subject
was
handled
but
of
the
overall
watch
list
system
and
how
it
can
be
strengthened
the
second
review
will
examine
all
screening
policies
technologies
and
procedures
related
to
air
travel
we
need
to
determine
just
how
the
suspect
was
able
to
bring
dangerous
explosives
aboard
an
aircraft
and
what
additional
steps
we
can
take
to
thwart
future
attacks
third
directed
my
national
security
team
to
keep
up
the
pressure
on
those
who
would
attack
our
country
we
do
not
yet
have
all
the
answers
about
this
latest
attempt
but
those
who
would
slaughter
innocent
men
women
and
children
must
know
that
the
united
states
will
more
do
more
than
simply
strengthen
our
defenses
we
will
continue
to
use
every
element
of
our
national
power
to
disrupt
to
dismantle
and
defeat
the
violent
extremists
who
threaten
us
whether
they
are
from
or
pakistan
yemen
or
somalia
or
anywhere
where
they
are
plotting
attacks
against
the
homeland
finally
the
american
people
should
remain
vigilant
but
also
be
confident
those
plotting
against
us
seek
not
only
to
undermine
our
security
but
also
the
open
society
and
the
values
that
we
cherish
as
americans
this
incident
like
several
that
have
preceded
it
demonstrates
that
an
alert
and
courageous
citizenry
are
far
more
resilient
than
an
isolated
extremist
as
nation
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
to
protect
our
country
as
americans
we
will
never
give
in
to
fear
or
division
we
will
be
guided
by
our
hopes
our
unity
and
our
deeply
held
values
that
who
we
are
as
americans
that
what
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
standing
up
for
as
they
spend
the
holidays
in
harm
way
and
we
will
continue
to
do
everything
that
we
can
to
keep
america
safe
in
the
new
year
and
beyond
before
leave
let
me
also
briefly
address
the
events
that
have
taken
place
over
the
last
few
days
in
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
the
united
states
joins
with
the
international
community
in
strongly
condemning
the
violent
and
unjust
suppression
of
innocent
iranian
citizens
which
has
apparently
resulted
in
detentions
injuries
and
even
death
for
months
the
iranian
people
have
sought
nothing
more
than
to
exercise
their
universal
rights
each
time
they
have
done
so
they
have
been
met
with
the
iron
fist
of
brutality
even
on
solemn
occasions
and
holy
days
and
each
time
that
has
happened
the
world
has
watched
with
deep
admiration
for
the
courage
and
the
conviction
of
the
iranian
people
who
are
part
of
iran
great
and
enduring
what
taking
place
within
iran
is
not
about
the
united
states
or
any
other
country
it
about
the
iranian
people
and
their
aspirations
for
justice
and
better
life
for
themselves
and
the
decision
of
iran
leaders
to
govern
through
fear
and
tyranny
will
not
succeed
in
making
those
aspirations
go
away
as
said
in
oslo
it
telling
when
governments
fear
the
aspirations
of
their
own
people
more
than
the
power
of
any
other
nation
along
with
all
free
nations
the
united
states
stands
with
those
who
seek
their
universal
rights
we
call
upon
the
iranian
government
to
abide
by
the
international
obligations
that
it
has
to
respect
the
rights
of
its
own
people
we
call
for
the
immediate
release
of
all
who
have
been
unjustly
detained
within
iran
we
will
continue
to
bear
witness
to
the
extraordinary
events
that
are
taking
place
there
and
confident
that
history
will
be
on
the
side
of
those
who
seek
justice
thank
you
very
much
everybody
and
happy
new
year
good
morning
it
is
an
for
me
to
join
this
distinguished
group
of
leaders
from
nations
around
the
world
we
come
here
in
because
climate
change
poses
grave
and
growing
danger
to
our
people
all
of
you
would
not
be
here
unless
you
like
me
were
convinced
that
this
danger
is
real
this
is
not
fiction
it
is
science
unchecked
climate
change
will
pose
unacceptable
risks
to
our
security
our
economies
and
our
planet
this
much
we
know
the
question
then
before
us
is
no
longer
the
nature
of
the
challenge
the
question
is
our
capacity
to
meet
it
for
while
the
reality
of
climate
change
is
not
in
doubt
have
to
be
honest
as
the
world
watches
us
today
think
our
ability
to
take
collective
action
is
in
doubt
right
now
and
it
hangs
in
the
balance
believe
we
can
act
boldly
and
decisively
in
the
face
of
common
threat
that
why
come
here
today
not
to
talk
but
to
act
now
as
the
world
largest
economy
and
as
the
world
second
largest
emitter
america
bears
our
responsibility
to
address
climate
change
and
we
intend
to
meet
that
responsibility
that
why
we
renewed
our
leadership
within
international
climate
change
negotiations
that
why
we
worked
with
other
nations
to
phase
out
fossil
fuel
subsidies
that
why
we
taken
bold
action
at
home
by
making
historic
investments
in
renewable
energy
by
putting
our
people
to
work
increasing
efficiency
in
our
homes
and
buildings
and
by
pursuing
comprehensive
legislation
to
transform
to
clean
energy
economy
these
mitigation
actions
are
ambitious
and
we
are
taking
them
not
simply
to
meet
global
responsibilities
we
are
convinced
as
some
of
you
may
be
convinced
that
changing
the
way
we
produce
and
use
energy
is
essential
to
america
economic
future
that
it
will
create
millions
of
new
jobs
power
new
industries
keep
us
competitive
and
spark
new
innovation
we
convinced
for
our
own
that
the
way
we
use
energy
changing
it
to
more
efficient
fashion
is
essential
to
our
national
security
because
it
helps
to
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
helps
us
deal
with
some
of
the
dangers
posed
by
climate
change
so
want
this
plenary
session
to
understand
america
is
going
to
continue
on
this
course
of
action
to
mitigate
our
emissions
and
to
move
towards
clean
energy
economy
no
matter
what
happens
here
in
we
think
it
is
good
for
us
as
well
as
good
for
the
world
but
we
also
believe
that
we
will
all
be
stronger
all
be
safer
all
be
more
secure
if
we
act
together
that
why
it
is
in
our
mutual
interest
to
achieve
global
accord
in
which
we
agree
to
certain
steps
and
to
hold
each
other
accountable
to
certain
commitments
after
months
of
talk
after
two
weeks
of
negotiations
after
innumerable
side
meetings
bilateral
meetings
endless
hours
of
discussion
among
negotiators
believe
that
the
pieces
of
that
accord
should
now
be
clear
first
all
major
economies
must
put
forward
decisive
national
actions
that
will
reduce
their
emissions
and
begin
to
turn
the
corner
on
climate
change
pleased
that
many
of
us
have
already
done
so
almost
all
the
major
economies
have
put
forward
legitimate
targets
significant
targets
ambitious
targets
and
confident
that
america
will
the
commitments
that
we
have
made
cutting
our
emissions
in
the
range
of
percent
by
and
by
more
than
percent
by
in
line
with
final
legislation
second
we
must
have
mechanism
to
review
whether
we
are
keeping
our
commitments
and
exchange
this
information
in
transparent
manner
these
measures
need
not
be
intrusive
or
infringe
upon
sovereignty
they
must
however
ensure
that
an
accord
is
credible
and
that
we
living
up
to
our
obligations
without
such
accountability
any
agreement
would
be
empty
words
on
page
do
know
how
you
have
an
international
agreement
where
we
all
are
not
sharing
information
and
ensuring
that
we
are
meeting
our
commitments
that
does
make
sense
it
would
be
hollow
victory
number
three
we
must
have
financing
that
helps
developing
countries
adapt
particularly
the
least
developed
and
most
vulnerable
countries
to
climate
change
america
will
be
part
of
funding
that
will
ramp
up
to
billion
by
and
yesterday
secretary
my
secretary
of
state
made
it
clear
that
we
will
engage
in
global
effort
to
billion
in
financing
by
if
and
only
if
it
is
part
of
broader
accord
that
have
just
described
mitigation
transparency
financing
it
clear
formula
one
that
embraces
the
principle
of
common
but
differentiated
responses
and
respective
capabilities
and
it
adds
up
to
significant
accord
one
that
takes
us
farther
than
we
have
ever
gone
before
as
an
international
community
just
want
to
say
to
this
plenary
session
that
we
are
running
short
on
time
and
at
this
point
the
question
is
whether
we
will
move
forward
together
or
split
apart
whether
we
prefer
posturing
to
action
sure
that
many
consider
this
an
imperfect
framework
that
just
described
no
country
will
get
everything
that
it
wants
there
are
those
developing
countries
that
want
aid
with
no
strings
attached
and
no
obligations
with
respect
to
transparency
they
think
that
the
most
advanced
nations
should
pay
higher
price
understand
that
there
are
those
advanced
nations
who
think
that
developing
countries
either
can
not
absorb
this
assistance
or
that
will
not
be
held
accountable
effectively
and
that
the
world
emitters
should
bear
greater
share
of
the
burden
we
know
the
fault
lines
because
we
been
imprisoned
by
them
for
years
these
international
discussions
have
essentially
taken
place
now
for
almost
two
decades
and
we
have
very
little
to
show
for
it
other
than
an
increased
acceleration
of
the
climate
change
phenomenon
the
time
for
talk
is
over
this
is
the
bottom
line
we
can
embrace
this
accord
take
substantial
step
forward
continue
to
refine
it
and
build
upon
its
foundation
we
can
do
that
and
everyone
who
is
in
this
room
will
be
part
of
historic
one
that
makes
life
better
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
or
we
can
choose
delay
falling
back
into
the
same
divisions
that
have
stood
in
the
way
of
action
for
years
and
we
will
be
back
having
the
same
stale
arguments
month
after
month
year
after
year
perhaps
decade
after
decade
all
while
the
danger
of
climate
change
grows
until
it
is
irreversible
ladies
and
gentlemen
there
is
no
time
to
waste
america
has
made
our
choice
we
have
charted
our
course
we
have
made
our
commitments
we
will
do
what
we
say
now
believe
it
the
time
for
the
nations
and
the
people
of
the
world
to
come
together
behind
common
purpose
we
are
ready
to
get
this
done
today
but
there
has
to
be
movement
on
all
sides
to
that
it
is
better
for
us
to
act
than
to
talk
better
for
us
to
choose
action
over
inaction
the
future
over
the
past
and
with
courage
and
faith
believe
that
we
can
meet
our
responsibility
to
our
people
and
the
future
of
our
planet
thank
you
very
much
your
majesties
your
royal
distinguished
members
of
the
committee
citizens
of
america
and
citizens
of
the
world
receive
this
with
deep
gratitude
and
great
humility
it
an
award
that
speaks
to
our
highest
aspirations
that
for
all
the
cruelty
and
hardship
of
our
world
we
are
not
mere
prisoners
of
fate
our
actions
matter
and
can
bend
history
in
the
direction
of
justice
and
yet
would
be
remiss
if
did
not
acknowledge
the
considerable
controversy
that
your
generous
decision
has
generated
in
part
this
is
because
am
at
the
beginning
and
not
the
end
of
my
on
the
world
stage
compared
to
some
of
the
giants
of
history
who
received
this
prize
and
king
and
mandela
my
accomplishments
are
slight
and
then
there
are
the
men
and
women
around
the
world
who
been
jailed
and
beaten
in
the
pursuit
of
justice
those
who
toil
in
humanitarian
to
relieve
suffering
the
millions
whose
quiet
acts
of
courage
and
compassion
inspire
even
the
most
hardened
cynics
can
not
argue
with
those
who
find
these
men
and
women
some
known
some
obscure
to
all
but
those
they
help
to
be
far
more
deserving
of
this
than
but
perhaps
the
most
profound
issue
surrounding
my
receipt
of
this
prize
is
the
fact
that
am
the
of
the
military
of
nation
in
the
midst
of
two
wars
one
of
these
wars
is
winding
down
the
other
is
conflict
that
america
did
not
seek
one
in
which
we
are
joined
by
other
countries
including
norway
in
an
effort
to
defend
ourselves
and
all
nations
from
further
attacks
still
we
are
at
war
and
am
for
the
deployment
of
thousands
of
young
americans
to
battle
in
distant
land
some
will
kill
and
some
will
be
killed
and
so
come
here
with
an
acute
sense
of
the
costs
of
armed
conflict
filled
with
difficult
questions
about
the
relationship
between
war
and
peace
and
our
effort
to
replace
one
with
the
other
now
these
questions
are
not
new
war
in
one
form
or
another
appeared
with
the
first
man
at
the
dawn
of
history
its
morality
was
not
questioned
it
was
simply
fact
like
drought
or
disease
the
manner
in
which
tribes
and
then
sought
power
and
settled
their
differences
and
over
time
as
codes
of
law
sought
to
control
violence
within
groups
so
did
philosophers
and
clerics
and
statesmen
seek
to
regulate
the
destructive
power
of
war
the
concept
of
just
war
emerged
suggesting
that
war
is
justified
only
when
certain
conditions
were
met
if
it
is
waged
as
last
resort
or
in
if
the
force
used
is
proportional
and
if
whenever
possible
civilians
are
spared
from
violence
of
course
we
know
that
for
most
of
history
this
concept
of
just
war
was
rarely
observed
the
capacity
of
human
beings
to
think
up
new
ways
to
kill
one
another
proved
inexhaustible
as
did
our
capacity
to
exempt
from
mercy
those
who
look
different
or
pray
to
different
god
wars
between
armies
gave
way
to
wars
between
nations
total
wars
in
which
the
distinction
between
combatant
and
civilian
became
blurred
in
the
span
of
years
such
carnage
would
twice
engulf
this
continent
and
while
it
hard
to
conceive
of
cause
more
just
than
the
defeat
of
the
third
reich
and
the
axis
powers
world
war
was
conflict
in
which
the
total
number
of
civilians
who
died
exceeded
the
number
of
soldiers
who
perished
in
the
wake
of
such
destruction
and
with
the
advent
of
the
nuclear
age
it
became
clear
to
victor
and
vanquished
alike
that
the
world
needed
institutions
to
prevent
another
world
war
and
so
quarter
century
after
the
united
states
senate
rejected
the
league
of
nations
an
idea
for
which
received
this
prize
america
led
the
world
in
constructing
an
architecture
to
keep
the
peace
plan
and
united
nations
mechanisms
to
govern
the
waging
of
war
treaties
to
protect
human
rights
prevent
genocide
restrict
the
most
dangerous
weapons
in
many
ways
these
efforts
succeeded
yes
terrible
wars
have
been
fought
and
atrocities
committed
but
there
has
been
no
third
world
war
the
cold
war
ended
with
jubilant
crowds
dismantling
wall
commerce
has
stitched
much
of
the
world
together
billions
have
been
lifted
from
poverty
the
ideals
of
liberty
and
equality
and
the
rule
of
law
have
haltingly
advanced
we
are
the
heirs
of
the
fortitude
and
foresight
of
generations
past
and
it
is
legacy
for
which
my
own
country
is
rightfully
proud
and
yet
decade
into
new
century
this
old
architecture
is
buckling
under
the
weight
of
new
threats
the
world
may
no
longer
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
war
between
two
nuclear
superpowers
but
proliferation
may
increase
the
risk
of
catastrophe
terrorism
has
long
been
tactic
but
modern
technology
allows
few
small
men
with
rage
to
murder
innocents
on
horrific
scale
moreover
wars
between
nations
have
increasingly
given
way
to
wars
within
nations
the
resurgence
of
ethnic
or
sectarian
conflicts
the
growth
of
secessionist
movements
and
failed
states
all
these
things
have
increasingly
trapped
civilians
in
unending
chaos
in
today
wars
many
more
civilians
are
killed
than
soldiers
the
seeds
of
future
conflict
are
sown
economies
are
wrecked
civil
societies
torn
asunder
refugees
amassed
children
scarred
do
not
bring
with
me
today
definitive
solution
to
the
problems
of
war
what
do
know
is
that
meeting
these
challenges
will
require
the
same
vision
hard
work
and
persistence
of
those
men
and
women
who
acted
so
boldly
decades
ago
and
it
will
require
us
to
think
in
new
ways
about
the
notions
of
just
war
and
the
imperatives
of
just
peace
we
must
begin
by
acknowledging
hard
truth
we
will
not
eradicate
violent
conflict
in
our
lifetimes
there
will
be
times
when
nations
acting
individually
or
in
concert
will
find
the
use
of
force
not
only
necessary
but
morally
justified
make
this
statement
mindful
of
what
martin
luther
king
said
in
this
same
ceremony
years
ago
violence
never
brings
permanent
peace
it
solves
no
social
problem
it
merely
creates
new
and
more
complicated
ones
as
someone
who
stands
here
as
direct
consequence
of
king
life
work
am
living
testimony
to
the
moral
force
of
know
there
nothing
weak
nothing
passive
nothing
in
the
creed
and
lives
of
gandhi
and
king
but
as
head
of
state
sworn
to
protect
and
defend
my
nation
can
not
be
guided
by
their
examples
alone
face
the
world
as
it
is
and
can
not
stand
idle
in
the
face
of
threats
to
the
american
people
for
make
no
mistake
evil
does
exist
in
the
world
movement
could
not
have
halted
hitler
armies
negotiations
can
not
convince
leaders
to
lay
down
their
arms
to
say
that
force
may
sometimes
be
necessary
is
not
call
to
cynicism
it
is
recognition
of
history
the
imperfections
of
man
and
the
limits
of
reason
raise
this
point
begin
with
this
point
because
in
many
countries
there
is
deep
ambivalence
about
military
action
today
no
matter
what
the
cause
and
at
times
this
is
joined
by
reflexive
suspicion
of
america
the
world
sole
military
superpower
yet
the
world
must
remember
that
it
was
not
simply
international
institutions
not
just
treaties
and
declarations
that
brought
stability
to
war
world
whatever
mistakes
we
have
made
the
plain
fact
is
this
the
united
states
of
america
has
helped
underwrite
global
security
for
more
than
six
decades
with
the
blood
of
our
citizens
and
the
strength
of
our
arms
the
service
and
sacrifice
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
has
promoted
peace
and
prosperity
from
germany
to
korea
and
enabled
democracy
to
take
hold
in
places
like
the
we
have
borne
this
burden
not
because
we
seek
to
impose
our
will
we
have
done
so
out
of
enlightened
because
we
seek
better
future
for
our
children
and
grandchildren
and
we
believe
that
their
lives
will
be
better
if
others
children
and
grandchildren
can
live
in
freedom
and
prosperity
so
yes
the
instruments
of
war
do
have
role
to
play
in
preserving
the
peace
and
yet
this
truth
must
coexist
with
another
that
no
matter
how
justified
war
promises
human
tragedy
the
soldier
courage
and
sacrifice
is
full
of
glory
expressing
devotion
to
country
to
cause
to
comrades
in
arms
but
war
itself
is
never
glorious
and
we
must
never
trumpet
it
as
such
so
part
of
our
challenge
is
reconciling
these
two
seemingly
irreconcilable
truths
that
war
is
sometimes
necessary
and
war
at
some
level
is
an
expression
of
human
folly
concretely
we
must
direct
our
effort
to
the
task
that
president
kennedy
called
for
long
ago
let
us
focus
he
said
on
more
practical
more
attainable
peace
based
not
on
sudden
revolution
in
human
nature
but
on
gradual
evolution
in
human
institutions
gradual
evolution
of
human
institutions
what
might
this
evolution
look
like
what
might
these
practical
steps
be
to
begin
with
believe
that
all
nations
strong
and
weak
alike
must
adhere
to
standards
that
govern
the
use
of
force
like
any
head
of
state
reserve
the
right
to
act
unilaterally
if
necessary
to
defend
my
nation
nevertheless
am
convinced
that
adhering
to
standards
international
standards
strengthens
those
who
do
and
isolates
and
weakens
those
who
do
the
world
rallied
around
america
after
the
attacks
and
continues
to
support
our
efforts
in
because
of
the
horror
of
those
senseless
attacks
and
the
principle
of
likewise
the
world
the
need
to
confront
when
he
invaded
kuwait
consensus
that
sent
clear
message
to
all
about
the
cost
of
aggression
furthermore
america
in
fact
no
nation
can
insist
that
others
follow
the
rules
of
the
road
if
we
refuse
to
follow
them
ourselves
for
when
we
do
our
actions
appear
arbitrary
and
undercut
the
legitimacy
of
future
interventions
no
matter
how
justified
and
this
becomes
particularly
important
when
the
purpose
of
military
action
extends
beyond
or
the
of
one
nation
against
an
aggressor
more
and
more
we
all
confront
difficult
questions
about
how
to
prevent
the
slaughter
of
civilians
by
their
own
government
or
to
stop
civil
war
whose
violence
and
suffering
can
engulf
an
entire
region
believe
that
force
can
be
justified
on
humanitarian
grounds
as
it
was
in
the
or
in
other
places
that
have
been
scarred
by
war
inaction
tears
at
our
conscience
and
can
lead
to
more
costly
intervention
later
that
why
all
responsible
nations
must
embrace
the
role
that
with
clear
mandate
can
play
to
keep
the
peace
america
commitment
to
global
security
will
never
waver
but
in
world
in
which
threats
are
more
diffuse
and
missions
more
complex
america
can
not
act
alone
america
alone
can
not
secure
the
peace
this
is
true
in
this
is
true
in
failed
states
like
somalia
where
terrorism
and
piracy
is
joined
by
famine
and
human
suffering
and
sadly
it
will
continue
to
be
true
in
unstable
regions
for
years
to
come
the
leaders
and
soldiers
of
nato
countries
and
other
friends
and
allies
demonstrate
this
truth
through
the
capacity
and
courage
they
shown
in
but
in
many
countries
there
is
disconnect
between
the
efforts
of
those
who
serve
and
the
ambivalence
of
the
broader
public
understand
why
war
is
not
popular
but
also
know
this
the
belief
that
peace
is
desirable
is
rarely
enough
to
achieve
it
peace
requires
responsibility
peace
entails
sacrifice
that
why
nato
continues
to
be
indispensable
that
why
we
must
strengthen
and
regional
peacekeeping
and
not
leave
the
task
to
few
countries
that
why
we
those
who
return
home
from
peacekeeping
and
training
abroad
to
oslo
and
rome
to
and
sydney
to
and
we
them
not
as
makers
of
war
but
as
of
wagers
but
as
wagers
of
peace
let
me
make
one
final
point
about
the
use
of
force
even
as
we
make
difficult
decisions
about
going
to
war
we
must
also
think
clearly
about
how
we
fight
it
the
committee
this
truth
in
awarding
its
first
prize
for
peace
to
henry
the
founder
of
the
red
cross
and
driving
force
behind
the
geneva
conventions
where
force
is
necessary
we
have
moral
and
strategic
interest
in
binding
ourselves
to
certain
rules
of
conduct
and
even
as
we
confront
vicious
adversary
that
abides
by
no
rules
believe
the
united
states
of
america
must
remain
standard
bearer
in
the
conduct
of
war
that
is
what
makes
us
different
from
those
whom
we
fight
that
is
source
of
our
strength
that
is
why
prohibited
torture
that
is
why
ordered
the
prison
at
bay
closed
and
that
is
why
have
reaffirmed
america
commitment
to
abide
by
the
geneva
conventions
we
lose
ourselves
when
we
compromise
the
very
ideals
that
we
fight
to
defend
and
we
we
those
ideals
by
upholding
them
not
when
it
easy
but
when
it
is
hard
spoken
at
some
length
to
the
question
that
must
weigh
on
our
minds
and
our
hearts
as
we
choose
to
wage
war
but
let
me
now
turn
to
our
effort
to
avoid
such
tragic
choices
and
speak
of
three
ways
that
we
can
build
just
and
lasting
peace
first
in
dealing
with
those
nations
that
break
rules
and
laws
believe
that
we
must
develop
alternatives
to
violence
that
are
tough
enough
to
actually
change
for
if
we
want
lasting
peace
then
the
words
of
the
international
community
must
mean
something
those
regimes
that
break
the
rules
must
be
held
accountable
sanctions
must
exact
real
price
intransigence
must
be
met
with
increased
pressure
and
such
pressure
exists
only
when
the
world
stands
together
as
one
one
urgent
example
is
the
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
to
seek
world
without
them
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
nations
agreed
to
be
bound
by
treaty
whose
bargain
is
clear
all
will
have
access
to
peaceful
nuclear
power
those
without
nuclear
weapons
will
forsake
them
and
those
with
nuclear
weapons
will
work
towards
disarmament
am
committed
to
upholding
this
treaty
it
is
of
my
foreign
policy
and
working
with
president
to
reduce
america
and
russia
nuclear
stockpiles
but
it
is
also
incumbent
upon
all
of
us
to
insist
that
nations
like
iran
and
north
korea
do
not
game
the
system
those
who
claim
to
respect
international
law
can
not
avert
their
eyes
when
those
laws
are
flouted
those
who
care
for
their
own
security
can
not
ignore
the
danger
of
an
arms
race
in
the
middle
east
or
east
asia
those
who
seek
peace
can
not
stand
idly
by
as
nations
arm
themselves
for
nuclear
war
the
same
principle
applies
to
those
who
violate
international
laws
by
their
own
people
when
there
is
genocide
in
systematic
rape
in
congo
repression
in
burma
there
must
be
consequences
yes
there
will
be
engagement
yes
there
will
be
diplomacy
but
there
must
be
consequences
when
those
things
fail
and
the
closer
we
stand
together
the
less
likely
we
will
be
faced
with
the
choice
between
armed
intervention
and
complicity
in
oppression
this
brings
me
to
second
point
the
nature
of
the
peace
that
we
seek
for
peace
is
not
merely
the
absence
of
visible
conflict
only
just
peace
based
on
the
inherent
rights
and
dignity
of
every
individual
can
truly
be
lasting
it
was
this
insight
that
drove
drafters
of
the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
after
the
second
world
war
in
the
wake
of
devastation
they
that
if
human
rights
are
not
protected
peace
is
hollow
promise
and
yet
too
often
these
words
are
ignored
for
some
countries
the
failure
to
uphold
human
rights
is
excused
by
the
false
suggestion
that
these
are
somehow
western
principles
foreign
to
local
cultures
or
stages
of
nation
development
and
within
america
there
long
been
tension
between
those
who
describe
themselves
as
realists
or
idealists
tension
that
suggests
stark
choice
between
the
narrow
pursuit
of
interests
or
an
endless
campaign
to
impose
our
values
around
the
world
reject
these
choices
believe
that
peace
is
unstable
where
citizens
are
denied
the
right
to
speak
freely
or
worship
as
they
please
choose
their
own
leaders
or
assemble
without
fear
grievances
fester
and
the
suppression
of
tribal
and
religious
identity
can
lead
to
violence
we
also
know
that
the
opposite
is
true
only
when
europe
became
free
did
it
finally
find
peace
america
has
never
fought
war
against
democracy
and
our
closest
friends
are
governments
that
protect
the
rights
of
their
citizens
no
matter
how
callously
defined
neither
america
interests
nor
the
world
are
served
by
the
denial
of
human
aspirations
so
even
as
we
respect
the
unique
culture
and
traditions
of
different
countries
america
will
always
be
voice
for
those
aspirations
that
are
universal
we
will
bear
witness
to
the
quiet
dignity
of
reformers
like
sang
to
the
bravery
of
who
cast
their
ballots
in
the
face
of
beatings
to
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
have
marched
silently
through
the
streets
of
iran
it
is
telling
that
the
leaders
of
these
governments
fear
the
aspirations
of
their
own
people
more
than
the
power
of
any
other
nation
and
it
is
the
responsibility
of
all
free
people
and
free
nations
to
make
clear
that
these
movements
these
movements
of
hope
and
history
they
have
us
on
their
side
let
me
also
say
this
the
promotion
of
human
rights
can
not
be
about
exhortation
alone
at
times
it
must
be
coupled
with
painstaking
diplomacy
know
that
engagement
with
repressive
regimes
lacks
the
satisfying
purity
of
indignation
but
also
know
that
sanctions
without
outreach
condemnation
without
discussion
can
carry
forward
only
crippling
status
no
repressive
regime
can
move
down
new
path
unless
it
has
the
choice
of
an
open
door
in
light
of
the
cultural
revolution
horrors
nixon
meeting
with
appeared
inexcusable
and
yet
it
surely
helped
set
china
on
path
where
millions
of
its
citizens
have
been
lifted
from
poverty
and
connected
to
open
societies
pope
john
paul
engagement
with
poland
created
space
not
just
for
the
catholic
church
but
for
leaders
like
efforts
on
arms
control
and
embrace
of
perestroika
not
only
improved
relations
with
the
soviet
union
but
empowered
dissidents
throughout
eastern
europe
there
no
simple
formula
here
but
we
must
try
as
best
we
can
to
balance
isolation
and
engagement
pressure
and
incentives
so
that
human
rights
and
dignity
are
advanced
over
time
third
just
peace
includes
not
only
civil
and
political
rights
it
must
encompass
economic
security
and
opportunity
for
true
true
peace
is
not
just
freedom
from
fear
but
freedom
from
want
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
development
rarely
takes
root
without
security
it
is
also
true
that
security
does
not
exist
where
human
beings
do
not
have
access
to
enough
food
or
clean
water
or
the
medicine
and
shelter
they
need
to
survive
it
does
not
exist
where
children
aspire
to
decent
education
or
job
that
supports
family
the
absence
of
hope
can
rot
society
from
within
and
that
why
helping
farmers
feed
their
own
people
or
nations
educate
their
children
and
care
for
the
sick
is
not
mere
charity
it
also
why
the
world
must
come
together
to
confront
climate
change
there
is
little
scientific
dispute
that
if
we
do
nothing
we
will
face
more
drought
more
famine
more
mass
displacement
all
of
which
will
fuel
more
conflict
for
decades
for
this
reason
it
is
not
merely
scientists
and
environmental
activists
who
call
for
swift
and
forceful
action
it
military
leaders
in
my
own
country
and
others
who
understand
our
common
security
hangs
in
the
balance
agreements
among
nations
strong
institutions
support
for
human
rights
investments
in
development
all
these
are
vital
ingredients
in
bringing
about
the
evolution
that
president
kennedy
spoke
about
and
yet
do
not
believe
that
we
will
have
the
will
the
determination
the
staying
power
to
complete
this
work
without
something
more
and
that
the
continued
expansion
of
our
moral
imagination
an
insistence
that
there
something
irreducible
that
we
all
share
as
the
world
grows
smaller
you
might
think
it
would
be
easier
for
human
beings
to
how
similar
we
are
to
understand
that
we
all
basically
seeking
the
same
things
that
we
all
hope
for
the
chance
to
live
out
our
lives
with
some
measure
of
happiness
and
for
ourselves
and
our
families
and
yet
somehow
given
the
dizzying
pace
of
the
cultural
of
modernity
it
perhaps
comes
as
no
surprise
that
people
fear
the
loss
of
what
they
cherish
in
their
particular
identities
their
their
race
their
tribe
and
perhaps
most
powerfully
their
religion
in
some
places
this
fear
has
led
to
conflict
at
times
it
even
feels
like
we
moving
backwards
we
see
it
in
the
middle
east
as
the
conflict
between
arabs
and
jews
seems
to
harden
we
see
it
in
nations
that
are
torn
asunder
by
tribal
lines
and
most
dangerously
we
see
it
in
the
way
that
religion
is
used
to
justify
the
murder
of
innocents
by
those
who
have
distorted
and
defiled
the
great
religion
of
islam
and
who
attacked
my
country
from
these
extremists
are
not
the
first
to
kill
in
the
name
of
god
the
cruelties
of
the
crusades
are
amply
recorded
but
they
remind
us
that
no
holy
war
can
ever
be
just
war
for
if
you
truly
believe
that
you
are
carrying
out
divine
will
then
there
is
no
need
for
restraint
no
need
to
spare
the
pregnant
mother
or
the
medic
or
the
red
cross
worker
or
even
person
of
one
own
sic
faith
such
warped
view
of
religion
is
not
just
incompatible
with
the
concept
of
peace
but
believe
it
incompatible
with
the
very
purpose
of
faith
for
the
one
rule
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
every
major
religion
is
that
we
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
adhering
to
this
law
of
love
has
always
been
the
core
struggle
of
human
nature
for
we
are
fallible
we
make
mistakes
and
fall
victim
to
the
temptations
of
pride
and
power
and
sometimes
evil
even
those
of
us
with
the
best
of
intentions
will
at
time
fail
to
right
the
wrongs
before
us
but
we
do
not
have
to
think
that
human
nature
is
perfect
for
us
to
still
believe
that
the
human
condition
can
be
perfected
we
do
not
have
to
live
in
an
world
to
still
reach
for
those
ideals
that
will
make
it
better
place
the
by
men
like
gandhi
and
king
may
not
have
been
practical
or
possible
in
every
circumstance
but
the
love
that
they
preached
their
fundamental
faith
in
human
progress
that
must
always
be
the
north
star
that
guides
us
on
our
journey
for
if
we
lose
that
faith
if
we
dismiss
it
as
silly
or
if
we
divorce
it
from
the
decisions
that
we
make
on
issues
of
war
and
peace
then
we
lose
what
best
about
humanity
we
lose
our
sense
of
possibility
we
lose
our
moral
compass
like
generations
have
before
us
we
must
reject
that
future
as
king
said
at
this
occasion
so
many
years
ago
refuse
to
accept
despair
as
the
final
response
to
the
ambiguities
of
history
refuse
to
accept
the
idea
that
the
of
man
present
condition
makes
him
morally
incapable
of
reaching
up
for
the
eternal
that
forever
confronts
him
let
us
reach
for
the
world
that
ought
to
be
that
spark
of
the
divine
that
still
within
each
of
our
souls
somewhere
today
in
the
here
and
now
in
the
world
as
it
is
soldier
sees
he
but
stands
firm
to
keep
the
peace
somewhere
today
in
this
world
young
protestor
awaits
the
brutality
of
her
government

so
much
for
your
extraordinary
leadership
here
at
and
thanks
to
all
of
you
in
attendance
almost
exactly
one
year
ago
on
frigid
winter
day
met
with
my
new
economic
team
at
the
headquarters
of
my
presidential
transition
offices
in
chicago
and
over
the
course
of
four
hours
my
presented
an
analysis
of
where
the
economy
at
that
time
stood
accompanied
by
chilling
set
of
charts
and
graphs
predicting
where
we
might
end
up
it
was
an
unforgettable
series
of
presentations
who
here
today
tapped
to
head
the
council
of
economic
advisers
as
well
as
summers
who
chosen
to
head
the
national
economic
council
described
an
imminent
downturn
comparable
in
its
severity
to
almost
nothing
since
the
my
incoming
treasury
secretary
reported
that
the
financial
system
shaken
by
the
crisis
had
halted
almost
all
lending
which
in
turn
threatened
to
pull
the
broader
economy
in
downward
spiral
peter
my
incoming
budget
director
closed
out
the
proceedings
with
an
entirely
dismal
report
on
the
fiscal
health
of
the
country
with
growing
deficits
and
debt
stretching
to
the
horizon
having
concluded
that
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
request
recount
tasked
my
team
with
mapping
out
plan
to
tackle
the
crisis
on
all
fronts
it
was
long
after
that
meeting
as
we
shaped
this
economic
plan
that
we
began
to
see
some
of
these
forecasts
over
the
previous
year
it
was
obvious
that
folks
were
facing
hard
times
as
across
the
country
during
the
long
campaign
would
meet
men
and
women
bearing
the
brunt
of
not
only
deepening
recession
but
also
years
even
decades
of
growing
strains
on
middle
class
families
but
now
the
country
was
experiencing
something
far
worse
our
gross
domestic
product
the
sum
total
of
all
that
our
economy
produces
fell
at
the
fastest
rate
in
quarter
century
five
trillion
dollars
of
americans
household
wealth
evaporated
in
just
weeks
as
stocks
pensions
and
home
values
plummeted
we
were
losing
an
average
of
jobs
each
month
equivalent
to
the
population
of
the
state
of
that
was
true
in
december
january
february
march
the
fear
among
economists
across
the
political
spectrum
that
was
was
that
we
were
rapidly
plummeting
towards
second
great
depression
so
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
followed
we
undertook
series
of
difficult
steps
to
prevent
that
outcome
and
we
were
forced
to
take
those
steps
largely
without
the
help
of
an
opposition
party
which
unfortunately
after
having
presided
over
the
that
had
led
to
the
crisis
decided
to
hand
it
over
to
others
to
solve
we
acted
to
get
lending
flowing
again
so
businesses
could
get
loans
to
buy
equipment
and
ordinary
americans
could
get
financing
to
buy
homes
and
cars
to
go
to
college
and
to
start
or
run
businesses
we
enacted
measures
to
stem
the
tide
of
in
our
housing
market
helping
responsible
homeowners
stay
in
their
homes
and
helping
to
stop
the
broader
decline
in
home
values
which
was
eating
away
at
what
tends
to
be
family
largest
asset
to
achieve
this
and
to
prevent
economic
collapse
we
were
forced
to
extend
assistance
to
some
of
the
very
banks
and
financial
institutions
whose
actions
had
helped
precipitate
the
turmoil
we
also
took
steps
to
prevent
the
rapid
dissolution
of
the
american
auto
industry
which
faced
crisis
partly
of
its
own
making
to
prevent
the
loss
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
during
an
already
fragile
shaky
time
these
were
not
decisions
that
were
popular
or
satisfying
these
were
decisions
that
were
necessary
now
even
as
we
worked
to
address
the
crises
in
our
banking
sector
in
our
housing
market
and
in
our
auto
industry
we
also
began
attacking
our
economic
crisis
on
broader
front
less
than
one
month
after
taking
office
we
enacted
the
most
sweeping
economic
recovery
package
in
history
the
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
act
the
recovery
act
was
divided
into
three
parts
went
for
tax
relief
for
small
businesses
and
percent
of
working
families
another
third
was
for
emergency
relief
to
help
folks
who
borne
the
brunt
of
this
recession
we
extended
or
increased
unemployment
benefits
for
more
than
million
americans
made
health
insurance
percent
cheaper
for
families
relying
on
cobra
and
for
state
and
local
governments
facing
historic
budget
shortfalls
as
demand
for
services
went
up
and
revenues
went
down
we
provided
assistance
that
has
saved
the
jobs
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
teachers
and
public
school
workers
firefighters
and
police
officers
the
last
third
of
the
recovery
act
is
for
investments
to
put
americans
to
work
doing
the
work
that
america
needs
done
doubling
our
capacity
in
renewable
energy
like
wind
and
solar
medical
records
to
save
money
and
lives
providing
the
largest
boost
to
medical
research
in
history
renovating
classrooms
and
school
laboratories
and
upgrading
roads
and
railways
as
part
of
the
largest
investment
in
infrastructure
since
the
creation
of
the
highway
system
half
century
ago
and
even
as
the
recovery
act
has
created
jobs
and
spurred
growth
we
have
not
let
up
in
our
efforts
to
take
every
responsible
action
to
get
the
economy
growing
and
america
working
this
fall
signed
into
law
more
than
billion
in
tax
cuts
for
struggling
businesses
extended
an
effective
tax
credit
for
and
provided
additional
unemployment
insurance
for
one
million
americans
and
the
treasury
is
continuing
to
adapt
our
financial
stability
plan
helping
to
facilitate
the
flow
of
small
credit
to
small
businesses
and
families
in
addition
we
working
to
break
down
barriers
and
open
overseas
markets
so
our
companies
can
better
compete
globally
creating
jobs
in
america
by
exporting
our
products
around
the
world
now
partly
as
result
of
these
and
other
steps
we
are
in
very
different
place
today
than
we
were
one
year
ago
we
may
forget
but
we
in
very
different
place
we
can
safely
say
that
we
are
no
longer
facing
the
potential
collapse
of
our
financial
system
and
we
avoided
the
depression
many
feared
our
economy
is
growing
for
the
first
time
in
year
and
the
swing
from
contraction
to
expansion
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
is
the
largest
in
nearly
three
decades
finally
we
no
longer
seeing
the
severe
deterioration
in
the
job
market
that
we
once
were
in
fact
we
learned
on
friday
that
the
unemployment
rate
fell
slightly
last
month
this
is
welcome
news
and
news
made
possible
in
part
by
the
up
to
million
jobs
that
the
recovery
act
has
already
created
and
saved
according
to
the
congressional
budget
office
but
here
today
because
our
work
is
far
from
done
for
even
though
we
reduced
the
deluge
of
job
losses
to
relative
trickle
we
are
not
yet
creating
jobs
at
pace
to
help
all
those
families
who
been
swept
up
in
the
flood
there
are
more
than
million
fewer
americans
with
jobs
today
than
when
this
recession
began
that
staggering
figure
and
one
that
reflects
not
only
the
depths
of
the
hole
from
which
we
must
ascend
but
also
continuing
human
tragedy
it
was
mentioned
that
was
in
this
past
weekend
and
went
to
job
where
people
were
engaged
in
job
search
and
it
ran
the
spectrum
blacks
whites
young
people
who
were
just
starting
their
careers
individuals
years
old
looking
for
job
and
they
were
putting
brave
face
on
it
confident
that
eventually
things
would
work
out
but
you
could
also
see
the
sense
of
anxiety
the
fear
that
perhaps
this
time
it
was
different
sometimes
it
hard
to
break
out
of
the
bubble
here
in
washington
and
remind
ourselves
that
behind
these
statistics
are
people
lives
their
capacity
to
do
right
by
their
families
it
speaks
to
an
urgent
need
to
accelerate
job
growth
in
the
short
term
while
laying
new
foundation
for
lasting
economic
growth
my
economic
team
has
been
considering
full
range
of
additional
ideas
to
help
accelerate
the
pace
of
private
sector
hiring
we
held
jobs
forum
at
the
white
house
that
brought
together
small
business
owners
union
members
economists
folks
from
and
state
and
local
officials
to
talk
about
job
creation
and
asked
people
to
lead
forums
in
their
own
communities
sending
the
results
to
me
so
we
are
hearing
as
many
voices
as
possible
as
we
refine
our
proposals
we
already
heard
number
of
good
ideas
and
know
we
learn
of
many
more
so
today
want
to
outline
some
of
the
broader
steps
that
believe
should
be
at
the
heart
of
our
effort
to
accelerate
job
growth
those
areas
that
will
generate
the
greatest
number
of
jobs
while
generating
the
greatest
value
for
our
economy
first
we
proposing
series
of
steps
to
help
small
businesses
grow
and
hire
new
staff
over
the
past
years
small
businesses
have
created
roughly
percent
of
all
new
jobs
in
america
these
are
companies
formed
around
kitchen
tables
in
family
meetings
formed
when
an
entrepreneur
takes
chance
on
dream
formed
when
worker
decides
it
time
she
became
her
own
boss
these
are
also
companies
that
drive
innovation
producing
times
more
patents
per
employee
than
large
companies
and
it
worth
remembering
every
once
in
while
small
business
becomes
big
business
and
changes
the
world
that
why
it
so
important
that
we
help
small
business
struggling
to
stay
open
or
struggling
to
open
in
the
first
place
during
these
difficult
times
building
on
the
tax
cuts
in
the
recovery
act
we
proposing
complete
elimination
of
capital
gains
taxes
on
small
business
investment
along
with
an
extension
of
to
encourage
small
businesses
to
expand
in
the
coming
year
and
believe
it
worthwhile
to
create
tax
incentive
to
encourage
small
businesses
to
add
and
keep
employees
and
going
to
work
with
congress
to
pass
one
now
these
steps
will
help
but
we
also
have
to
address
the
continuing
struggle
of
small
businesses
to
get
loans
that
they
need
to
start
up
and
grow
to
that
end
we
proposing
to
waive
fees
and
increase
the
guarantees
for
loans
and
asking
my
treasury
secretary
to
continue
the
remaining
funds
to
facilitate
lending
to
small
businesses
second
we
proposing
boost
in
investment
in
the
nation
infrastructure
beyond
what
was
included
in
the
recovery
act
to
continue
our
transportation
and
communications
networks
these
are
needed
public
works
that
engage
private
sector
companies
spurring
hiring
all
across
the
country
already
more
than
of
these
projects
have
been
funded
through
the
recovery
act
and
by
design
recovery
act
work
on
roads
bridges
water
systems
sites
broadband
networks
and
clean
energy
projects
will
all
be
ramping
up
in
the
months
ahead
it
was
planned
this
way
for
two
reasons
so
the
impact
would
be
felt
over
period
and
more
importantly
because
we
wanted
to
do
this
right
the
potential
for
abuse
in
program
of
this
magnitude
while
operating
at
such
fast
pace
was
enormous
so
asked
vice
president
and
others
to
make
sure
to
the
extent
humanly
possible
that
the
investments
were
sound
the
projects
worthy
and
the
execution
efficient
what
this
means
is
that
we
going
to
see
even
more
work
and
workers
on
recovery
projects
in
the
next
six
months
than
we
saw
in
the
last
six
months
even
so
there
are
many
more
worthy
projects
than
there
were
dollars
to
fund
them
that
by
their
nature
these
projects
often
take
time
and
will
therefore
create
jobs
over
time
but
the
need
for
jobs
will
also
last
beyond
next
year
and
the
benefits
of
these
investments
will
last
years
beyond
that
so
adding
to
this
initiative
to
rebuild
america
infrastructure
is
the
right
thing
to
do
third
calling
on
congress
to
consider
new
program
to
provide
incentives
for
consumers
who
retrofit
their
homes
to
become
more
which
we
know
creates
jobs
saves
money
for
families
and
reduces
the
pollution
that
threatens
our
environment
and
proposing
that
we
expand
select
recovery
act
initiatives
to
promote
energy
efficiency
and
clean
energy
jobs
which
have
been
proven
to
be
particularly
popular
and
effective
it
positive
sign
that
many
of
these
programs
drew
so
many
applicants
for
funding
that
lot
of
strong
proposals
proposals
that
will
leverage
private
capital
and
create
jobs
quickly
did
not
make
the
cut
with
additional
resources
in
areas
like
advanced
manufacturing
of
wind
turbines
and
solar
panels
for
instance
we
can
help
turn
good
ideas
into
good
private
sector
jobs
finally
as
we
are
moving
forward
in
these
areas
we
should
also
extend
the
relief
in
the
recovery
act
including
emergency
assistance
to
seniors
unemployment
insurance
benefits
cobra
and
relief
to
states
and
localities
to
prevent
layoffs
this
will
help
folks
weathering
these
storms
while
boosting
consumer
spending
and
promoting
job
growth
of
course
there
only
so
much
government
can
do
job
creation
will
ultimately
depend
on
the
real
job
creators
businesses
across
america
we
were
encouraged
today
to
hear
from
the
business
that
their
survey
showed
greater
confidence
and
greater
potential
investment
coming
out
of
the
business
community
government
can
help
lay
the
groundwork
on
which
the
private
sector
can
better
generate
jobs
growth
and
innovation
after
all
small
business
tax
relief
is
not
substitute
for
ingenuity
and
industriousness
by
our
entrepreneurs
but
it
can
help
those
with
good
ideas
to
grow
and
expand
incentives
to
promote
energy
efficiency
and
clean
energy
manufacturing
do
automatically
create
jobs
or
lower
carbon
emissions
but
these
steps
provide
framework
in
which
companies
can
compete
and
innovate
to
create
those
jobs
and
reduce
energy
consumption
and
while
the
physical
and
virtual
networks
that
connect
us
will
create
jobs
they
do
so
while
making
it
possible
for
companies
to
more
easily
and
effectively
move
their
products
across
this
country
and
around
the
world
and
that
will
create
more
jobs
and
given
the
challenges
of
accelerating
the
pace
of
hiring
in
the
private
sector
these
targeted
initiatives
are
right
and
they
are
needed
but
with
fiscal
crisis
to
match
our
economic
crisis
we
also
must
be
prudent
about
how
we
fund
it
so
to
help
support
these
efforts
we
are
going
to
wind
down
the
troubled
asset
relief
program
or
the
fund
created
to
the
financial
system
so
banks
would
lend
again
do
think
have
to
tell
you
there
has
rarely
been
less
loved
or
more
necessary
emergency
program
than
which
as
galling
as
the
assistance
to
banks
may
have
been
indisputably
helped
prevent
collapse
of
the
entire
financial
system
launched
hastily
understandably
but
hastily
under
the
last
administration
the
program
was
flawed
and
we
have
worked
hard
to
correct
those
flaws
and
manage
it
properly
and
today
has
served
its
original
purpose
and
at
much
lower
cost
than
we
expected
in
fact
because
of
our
stewardship
of
this
program
and
the
transparency
and
accountability
we
put
in
place
is
expected
to
cost
the
taxpayers
at
least
billion
less
than
what
was
anticipated
just
this
past
summer
and
the
assistance
to
banks
once
thought
to
cost
taxpayers
untold
billions
is
on
track
to
actually
reap
billions
in
profits
for
the
taxpaying
public
so
this
gives
us
chance
to
pay
down
the
deficit
faster
than
we
thought
possible
and
to
shift
funds
that
would
have
gone
to
help
the
banks
on
wall
street
to
help
create
jobs
on
main
street
small
business
infrastructure
clean
energy
these
are
areas
in
which
we
can
put
americans
to
work
while
putting
our
nation
on
sturdier
economic
footing
that
foundation
for
sustained
economic
growth
that
must
be
our
continuing
focus
and
our
ultimate
goal
said
this
before
even
before
this
particular
crisis
much
of
our
growth
for
decade
or
more
had
been
by
unsustainable
consumer
debt
and
reckless
financial
speculation
while
we
ignored
the
fundamental
challenges
that
hold
the
key
to
our
economic
prosperity
we
can
not
simply
go
back
to
the
way
things
used
to
be
we
go
back
to
an
economy
that
yielded
cycle
after
cycle
of
speculative
booms
and
painful
busts
we
continue
to
accept
an
education
system
in
which
our
students
trail
their
peers
in
other
countries
and
health
care
system
in
which
exploding
costs
put
our
businesses
at
competitive
disadvantage
and
we
can
not
continue
to
ignore
the
clean
energy
challenge
or
cede
global
leadership
in
the
emerging
industries
of
the
century
and
that
why
even
as
we
strive
to
meet
the
crisis
of
the
moment
we
have
insisted
on
laying
new
foundation
for
the
future
because
an
educated
workforce
is
essential
to
century
global
economy
we
launched
competitive
race
to
the
top
fund
through
the
recovery
act
to
reform
our
schools
and
raise
achievement
especially
in
math
and
science
and
we
made
college
more
affordable
proposed
historic
set
of
reforms
and
investments
in
community
college
and
set
goal
of
once
again
leading
the
world
in
producing
college
graduates
by
the
year
because
even
the
worker
in
the
world
compete
if
our
businesses
are
saddled
with
rapidly
increasing
health
care
costs
we
are
fighting
to
do
what
we
have
discussed
in
this
country
for
generations
finally
reforming
our
nation
broken
health
insurance
system
and
relieving
this
unsustainable
burden
because
our
economic
future
depends
on
financial
system
that
encourages
sound
investments
honest
dealings
and
growth
we
proposed
the
most
ambitious
financial
reforms
since
the
great
depression
we
set
and
enforce
clear
rules
of
the
road
close
loopholes
in
oversight
charge
new
agency
with
protecting
consumers
and
address
the
dangerous
systemic
risks
that
brought
us
to
the
brink
of
disaster
these
reforms
are
moving
through
congress
we
working
to
keep
those
reforms
strong
and
looking
forward
to
signing
them
into
law
and
because
our
economic
future
depends
on
our
leadership
in
the
industries
of
the
future
we
are
investing
in
basic
applied
research
and
working
to
create
the
incentives
to
build
new
clean
energy
economy
for
we
know
the
nation
that
leads
in
clean
energy
will
be
the
nation
that
leads
the
world
want
america
to
be
that
nation
want
america
prosperity
to
be
powered
by
what
we
invent
and
pioneer
not
just
what
we
borrow
and
what
we
consume
and
know
that
we
can
and
will
be
that
nation
if
we
are
willing
to
do
what
it
takes
to
get
there
now
there
are
those
who
claim
we
have
to
choose
between
paying
down
our
deficits
on
the
one
hand
and
investing
in
job
creation
and
economic
growth
on
the
other
this
is
false
choice
ensuring
that
economic
growth
and
job
creation
are
strong
and
sustained
is
critical
to
ensuring
that
we
are
increasing
revenues
and
decreasing
spending
on
things
like
unemployment
insurance
so
that
our
deficits
will
start
coming
down
at
the
same
time
instilling
confidence
in
our
commitment
to
being
fiscally
prudent
gives
the
private
sector
the
confidence
to
make
investments
in
our
people
and
in
america
so
one
of
the
central
goals
of
this
administration
is
restoring
fiscal
responsibility
even
as
we
have
had
to
spend
our
way
out
of
this
recession
in
the
near
term
we
begun
to
make
the
hard
choices
necessary
to
get
our
country
on
more
stable
fiscal
footing
in
the
long
run
so
let
me
just
be
clear
here
despite
what
some
have
claimed
the
cost
of
the
recovery
act
is
only
very
small
part
of
our
current
budget
imbalance
in
reality
the
deficit
had
been
building
dramatically
over
the
previous
eight
years
we
have
structural
gap
between
the
money
going
out
and
the
money
coming
in
folks
passed
tax
cuts
and
expansive
entitlement
programs
without
paying
for
any
of
it
even
as
health
care
costs
kept
rising
year
after
year
as
result
the
deficit
had
reached
trillion
when
we
walked
into
the
white
house
and
note
these
tax
cuts
and
spending
programs
were
approved
by
many
of
the
same
people
who
are
now
waxing
political
about
fiscal
responsibility
while
opposing
our
efforts
to
reduce
deficits
by
getting
health
care
costs
under
control
it
sight
to
see
the
fact
is
we
have
refused
to
go
along
with
business
as
usual
we
are
taking
responsibility
for
every
dollar
we
spend
we
done
what
some
said
was
impossible
preventing
wasteful
spending
on
outdated
weapons
systems
that
even
the
pentagon
said
it
did
want
we
combed
the
budget
cutting
waste
and
excess
wherever
we
could
still
committed
to
halving
the
deficit
we
inherited
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
cutting
it
in
half
and
made
clear
from
day
one
that
would
not
sign
health
insurance
reform
bill
if
it
raised
the
deficit
by
one
dime
and
neither
the
house
nor
the
senate
bill
does
we
begun
not
only
changing
policies
in
washington
we
also
begun
to
change
the
culture
in
washington
in
the
end
the
economic
crisis
of
the
past
year
was
not
just
the
result
of
weaknesses
in
our
economy
it
was
also
the
result
of
weaknesses
in
our
political
system
because
for
decades
too
many
in
washington
put
off
the
hard
decisions
for
decades
we
watched
as
efforts
to
solve
tough
problems
have
fallen
prey
to
the
bitterness
of
partisanship
to
prosaic
concerns
of
politics
to
news
cycles
to
endless
campaigns
focused
on
scoring
points
instead
of
meeting
our
common
challenges
we
seen
the
consequences
of
this
failure
of
responsibility
the
american
people
have
paid
heavy
price
and
the
question
we
have
to
answer
now
is
if
we
going
to
learn
from
our
past
or
if
even
in
the
aftermath
of
disaster
we
going
to
repeat
those
same
mistakes
as
the
alarm
bells
fade
the
din
of
washington
rises
as
the
forces
of
the
status
marshal
their
resources
we
can
be
sure
that
answering
this
question
will
be
fight
to
the
finish
but
have
every
hope
and
expectation
that
we
can
rise
to
this
moment
that
we
can
transcend
the
failures
of
the
past
that
we
can
once
again
take
responsibility
for
our
future
every
night
read
letters
and
sent
to
me
from
people
across
america
ordinary
folks
people
who
share
their
hopes
and
their
hardships
their
faith
in
this
country
their
frustration
with
what
happened
in
this
economy
hear
from
small
business
owners
worried
about
making
payroll
keeping
their
doors
open
hear
from
mothers
and
fathers
sons
and
daughters
who
seen
one
or
two
or
more
family
members
out
of
work
the
toughest
letters
are
in
children
handwriting
kids
write
to
me
my
dad
just
lost
job
my
grandma
is
sick
she
afford
health
insurance
kids
who
just
be
kids
because
they
worried
about
mom
having
her
hours
cut
or
dad
losing
job
or
family
without
health
insurance
these
folks
are
looking
for
handout
they
not
looking
for
bailout
just
like
those
people
visited
in
all
they
looking
for
is
chance
to
make
their
own
way
to
work
to
succeed
using
their
talents
and
skills
and
they
looking
for
folks
in
washington
to
have
seriousness
of
purpose
that
matches
the
reality
of
their
struggle
everywhere
gone
every
stop
made
there
are
people
like
this
men
and
women
who
have
faced
misfortune
but
who
stand
ready
to
build
better
future
students
ready
to
learn
workers
eager
to
work
scientists
on
the
brink
of
discovery
entrepreneurs
seeking
the
chance
to
open
small
business
everywhere
go
there
are
factories
just
waiting
to
whir
back
to
life
in
burgeoning
industries
there
is
nation
ready
to
meet
the
challenges
of
this
new
age
and
to
lead
the
world
in
this
new
century
and
as
we
look
back
on
the
progress
of
the
past
year
and
look
forward
to
the
work
ahead
have
every
confidence
that
we
will
do
exactly
that
these
have
been
tough
two
years
and
there
will
no
doubt
be
difficult
months
ahead
but
the
storms
of
the
past
are
receding
the
skies
are
brightening
and
the
horizon
is
beckoning
once
more
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
please
be
seated
good
evening
to
the
united
states
corps
of
cadets
to
the
men
and
women
of
our
armed
services
and
to
my
fellow
americans
want
to
speak
to
you
tonight
about
our
effort
in
the
nature
of
our
commitment
there
the
scope
of
our
interests
and
the
strategy
that
my
administration
will
pursue
to
bring
this
war
to
successful
conclusion
it
an
extraordinary
for
me
to
do
so
here
at
west
point
where
so
many
men
and
women
have
prepared
to
stand
up
for
our
security
and
to
represent
what
is
finest
about
our
country
to
address
these
important
issues
it
important
to
recall
why
america
and
our
allies
were
compelled
to
fight
war
in
in
the
first
place
we
did
not
ask
for
this
fight
on
september
men
hijacked
four
and
used
them
to
murder
nearly
people
they
struck
at
our
military
and
economic
nerve
they
took
the
lives
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
without
regard
to
their
faith
or
race
or
station
were
it
not
for
the
heroic
actions
of
passengers
on
board
one
of
these
flights
they
could
have
also
struck
at
one
of
the
great
symbols
of
our
democracy
in
washington
and
killed
many
more
as
we
know
these
men
belonged
to
group
of
extremists
who
have
distorted
and
defiled
islam
one
of
the
world
great
religions
to
justify
the
slaughter
of
innocents
base
of
operations
was
in
where
they
were
by
the
ruthless
repressive
and
radical
movement
that
seized
control
of
that
country
after
it
was
ravaged
by
years
of
soviet
occupation
and
civil
war
and
after
the
attention
of
america
and
our
friends
had
turned
elsewhere
just
days
after
congress
the
use
of
force
against
and
those
who
them
an
that
continues
to
this
day
the
vote
in
the
senate
was
to
the
vote
in
the
house
was
to
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
north
atlantic
treaty
invoked
article
the
commitment
that
says
an
attack
on
one
member
nation
is
an
attack
on
all
and
the
united
nations
security
council
endorsed
the
use
of
all
necessary
steps
to
respond
to
the
attacks
america
our
allies
and
the
world
were
acting
as
one
to
destroy
terrorist
network
and
to
protect
our
common
security
under
the
banner
of
this
domestic
unity
and
international
legitimacy
and
only
after
the
refused
to
turn
over
bin
laden
we
sent
our
troops
into
within
matter
of
months
was
scattered
and
many
of
its
operatives
were
killed
the
was
driven
from
power
and
pushed
back
on
its
heels
place
that
had
known
decades
of
fear
now
had
reason
to
hope
at
conference
convened
by
the
provisional
government
was
established
under
president
and
an
international
security
assistance
force
was
established
to
help
bring
lasting
peace
to
country
then
in
early
the
decision
was
made
to
wage
second
war
in
iraq
the
wrenching
debate
over
the
iraq
war
is
and
need
not
be
repeated
here
it
enough
to
say
that
for
the
next
six
years
the
iraq
war
drew
the
dominant
share
of
our
troops
our
resources
our
diplomacy
and
our
national
attention
and
that
the
decision
to
go
into
iraq
caused
substantial
rifts
between
america
and
much
of
the
world
today
after
extraordinary
costs
we
are
bringing
the
iraq
war
to
an
responsible
end
we
will
remove
our
combat
brigades
from
iraq
by
the
end
of
next
summer
and
all
of
our
troops
by
the
end
of
that
we
are
doing
so
is
testament
to
the
character
of
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
thanks
to
their
courage
grit
and
perseverance
we
have
given
iraqis
chance
to
shape
their
future
and
we
are
successfully
leaving
iraq
to
its
people
but
while
we
have
achieved
milestones
in
iraq
the
situation
in
has
deteriorated
after
escaping
across
the
border
into
pakistan
in
and
leadership
established
there
although
legitimate
government
was
elected
by
the
afghan
people
it
been
hampered
by
corruption
the
drug
trade
an
economy
and
insufficient
security
forces
over
the
last
several
years
the
has
maintained
common
cause
with
as
they
both
seek
an
overthrow
of
the
afghan
government
gradually
the
has
begun
to
control
additional
of
territory
in
while
engaging
in
increasingly
brazen
and
devastating
attacks
of
terrorism
against
the
people
now
throughout
this
period
our
troop
levels
in
remained
fraction
of
what
they
were
in
iraq
when
took
office
we
had
just
over
americans
serving
in
compared
to
in
iraq
at
the
peak
of
the
war
commanders
in
repeatedly
asked
for
support
to
deal
with
the
of
the
but
these
reinforcements
did
not
arrive
and
that
why
shortly
after
taking
office
approved
request
for
more
troops
after
consultations
with
our
allies
then
announced
strategy
the
fundamental
connection
between
our
war
effort
in
and
the
extremist
in
pakistan
set
goal
that
was
narrowly
defined
as
disrupting
dismantling
and
defeating
and
its
extremist
allies
and
pledged
to
better
coordinate
our
military
and
civilian
effort
since
then
we
have
made
progress
on
some
important
objectives
and
leaders
have
been
killed
and
we
stepped
up
the
pressure
on
in
pakistan
that
nation
army
has
gone
on
its
largest
offensive
in
years
in
we
and
our
allies
prevented
the
from
stopping
presidential
election
and
although
it
was
marred
by
fraud
that
election
produced
government
that
is
consistent
with
laws
and
constitution
yet
huge
challenges
remain
is
not
lost
but
for
several
years
it
has
moved
backwards
there
no
imminent
threat
of
the
government
being
overthrown
but
the
has
gained
momentum
has
not
in
in
the
same
numbers
as
before
but
they
retain
their
along
the
border
and
our
forces
lack
the
full
support
they
need
to
effectively
train
and
partner
with
afghan
security
forces
and
better
secure
the
population
our
new
commander
in
general
has
reported
that
the
security
situation
is
more
serious
than
he
anticipated
in
short
the
status
is
not
sustainable
as
cadets
you
volunteered
for
service
during
this
time
of
danger
some
of
you
fought
in
some
of
you
will
deploy
there
as
your
owe
you
mission
that
is
clearly
defined
and
worthy
of
your
service
and
that
why
after
the
afghan
voting
was
completed
insisted
on
thorough
review
of
our
strategy
now
let
me
be
clear
there
has
never
been
an
option
before
me
that
called
for
troop
deployments
before
so
there
has
been
no
delay
or
denial
of
resources
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
the
war
during
this
review
period
instead
the
review
has
allowed
me
ask
the
hard
questions
and
to
explore
all
of
the
different
options
along
with
my
national
security
team
our
military
and
civilian
leadership
in
and
our
key
partners
now
given
the
stakes
involved
owed
the
american
people
and
our
troops
no
less
this
review
is
now
complete
and
as
have
determined
that
it
is
in
our
vital
national
interest
to
send
an
additional
troops
to
after
months
our
troops
will
begin
to
come
home
these
are
the
resources
that
we
need
to
seize
the
initiative
while
building
the
afghan
capacity
that
can
allow
for
responsible
transition
of
our
forces
out
of
do
not
make
this
decision
lightly
opposed
the
war
in
iraq
precisely
because
believe
that
we
must
exercise
restraint
in
the
use
of
military
force
and
always
consider
the
consequences
of
our
actions
we
have
been
at
war
now
for
eight
years
at
enormous
cost
in
lives
and
resources
years
of
debate
over
iraq
and
terrorism
have
left
our
unity
on
national
security
issues
in
tatters
and
created
highly
and
partisan
backdrop
for
this
effort
and
having
just
experienced
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
the
american
people
are
understandably
focused
on
rebuilding
our
economy
and
putting
people
to
work
here
at
home
and
most
of
all
know
that
this
decision
asks
even
more
of
you
military
that
along
with
your
families
has
already
borne
the
heaviest
of
all
burdens
as
president
have
signed
letter
of
condolence
to
the
family
of
each
american
who
gives
their
life
in
these
wars
have
read
the
letters
from
the
parents
and
spouses
of
those
who
deployed
visited
our
courageous
wounded
warriors
at
reed
travelled
to
dover
to
meet
the
caskets
of
americans
returning
home
to
their
final
resting
see
firsthand
the
terrible
wages
of
war
if
did
not
think
that
the
security
of
the
united
states
and
the
safety
of
the
american
people
were
at
stake
in
would
gladly
order
every
single
one
of
our
troops
home
tomorrow
so
no
do
not
make
this
decision
lightly
make
this
decision
because
am
convinced
that
our
security
is
at
stake
in
and
pakistan
this
is
the
of
violent
extremism
by
it
is
from
here
that
we
were
attacked
on
and
it
is
from
here
that
new
attacks
are
being
plotted
as
speak
this
is
no
idle
danger
no
hypothetical
threat
in
the
last
few
months
alone
we
have
apprehended
extremists
within
our
borders
who
were
sent
here
from
the
border
region
of
and
pakistan
to
commit
new
acts
of
terror
and
this
danger
will
only
grow
if
the
region
slides
backwards
and
can
operate
with
impunity
we
must
keep
the
pressure
on
and
to
do
that
we
must
increase
the
stability
and
capacity
of
our
partners
in
the
region
of
course
this
burden
is
not
ours
alone
to
bear
this
is
not
just
america
war
since
have
been
the
source
of
attacks
against
london
and
amman
and
bali
the
people
and
governments
of
both
and
pakistan
are
endangered
and
the
stakes
are
even
higher
within
pakistan
because
we
know
that
and
other
extremists
seek
nuclear
weapons
and
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
use
them
these
facts
compel
us
to
act
along
with
our
friends
and
allies
our
goal
remains
the
same
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
in
and
pakistan
and
to
prevent
its
capacity
to
threaten
america
and
our
allies
in
the
future
to
meet
that
goal
we
will
pursue
the
following
objectives
within
we
must
deny
we
must
reverse
the
momentum
and
deny
it
the
ability
to
overthrow
the
government
and
we
must
strengthen
the
capacity
of
security
forces
and
government
so
that
they
can
take
lead
responsibility
for
future
we
will
meet
these
objectives
in
three
ways
first
we
will
pursue
military
strategy
that
will
break
the
momentum
and
increase
capacity
over
the
next
months
the
additional
troops
that
announcing
tonight
will
deploy
in
the
first
part
of
the
fastest
possible
pace
so
that
they
can
target
the
insurgency
and
secure
key
population
they
increase
our
ability
to
train
competent
afghan
security
forces
and
to
partner
with
them
so
that
more
afghans
can
get
into
the
fight
and
they
will
help
create
the
conditions
for
the
united
states
to
transfer
responsibility
to
the
afghans
because
this
is
an
international
effort
asked
that
our
commitment
be
joined
by
contributions
from
our
allies
some
have
already
provided
additional
troops
and
we
confident
that
there
will
be
further
contributions
in
the
days
and
weeks
ahead
our
friends
have
fought
and
bled
and
died
alongside
us
in
and
now
we
must
come
together
to
end
this
war
successfully
for
what
at
stake
is
not
simply
test
of
nato
credibility
what
at
stake
is
the
security
of
our
allies
and
the
common
security
of
the
world
now
taken
together
these
additional
american
and
international
troops
will
allow
us
to
accelerate
handing
over
responsibility
to
afghan
forces
and
allow
us
to
begin
the
transfer
of
our
forces
out
of
in
july
of
just
as
we
have
done
in
iraq
we
will
execute
this
transition
responsibly
taking
into
account
conditions
on
the
ground
we
continue
to
advise
and
assist
security
forces
to
ensure
that
they
can
succeed
over
the
long
haul
but
it
will
be
clear
to
the
afghan
government
and
more
importantly
to
the
afghan
people
that
they
will
ultimately
be
responsible
for
their
own
country
second
we
will
work
with
our
partners
the
united
nations
and
the
afghan
people
to
pursue
more
effective
civilian
strategy
so
that
the
government
can
take
advantage
of
improved
security
this
effort
must
be
based
on
performance
the
days
of
providing
blank
check
are
over
president
inauguration
sent
the
right
message
about
moving
in
new
direction
and
going
forward
we
will
be
clear
about
what
we
expect
from
those
who
receive
our
assistance
we
support
afghan
ministries
governors
and
local
leaders
that
combat
corruption
and
deliver
for
the
people
we
expect
those
who
are
ineffective
or
corrupt
to
be
held
accountable
and
we
will
also
focus
our
assistance
in
areas
such
as
agriculture
that
can
make
an
immediate
impact
in
the
lives
of
the
afghan
people
the
people
of
have
endured
violence
for
decades
they
been
confronted
with
occupation
by
the
soviet
union
and
then
by
foreign
fighters
who
used
afghan
land
for
their
own
purposes
so
tonight
want
the
afghan
people
to
understand
america
seeks
an
end
to
this
era
of
war
and
suffering
we
have
no
interest
in
occupying
your
country
we
will
support
efforts
by
the
afghan
government
to
open
the
door
to
those
who
abandon
violence
and
respect
the
human
rights
of
their
fellow
citizens
and
we
will
seek
partnership
with
grounded
in
mutual
respect
to
isolate
those
who
destroy
to
strengthen
those
who
build
to
hasten
the
day
when
our
troops
will
leave
and
to
forge
lasting
friendship
in
which
america
is
your
partner
and
never
your
patron
third
we
will
act
with
the
full
recognition
that
our
success
in
is
inextricably
linked
to
our
partnership
with
pakistan
we
in
to
prevent
cancer
from
once
again
spreading
through
that
country
but
this
same
cancer
has
also
taken
root
in
the
border
region
of
pakistan
and
that
why
we
need
strategy
that
works
on
both
sides
of
the
border
in
the
past
there
have
been
those
in
pakistan
who
have
argued
that
the
struggle
against
extremism
is
not
their
fight
and
that
pakistan
is
better
off
doing
little
or
seeking
accommodation
with
those
who
use
violence
but
in
recent
years
as
innocents
have
been
killed
from
to
it
has
become
clear
that
it
is
the
people
who
are
the
most
endangered
by
extremism
public
opinion
has
turned
the
army
has
waged
an
offensive
in
swat
and
south
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
united
states
and
pakistan
share
common
enemy
in
the
past
we
too
often
defined
our
relationship
with
pakistan
narrowly
and
those
days
are
over
moving
forward
we
are
committed
to
partnership
with
pakistan
that
is
built
on
foundation
of
mutual
interests
mutual
respect
and
mutual
trust
we
will
strengthen
pakistan
capacity
to
target
those
groups
that
threaten
our
countries
and
have
made
it
clear
that
we
can
not
tolerate
for
terrorists
whose
location
is
known
and
whose
intentions
are
clear
america
is
also
providing
substantial
resources
to
support
pakistan
democracy
and
development
we
are
the
largest
international
supporter
for
those
displaced
by
the
fighting
and
going
forward
the
people
must
know
america
will
remain
strong
supporter
of
pakistan
security
and
prosperity
long
after
the
guns
have
fallen
silent
so
that
the
great
potential
of
its
people
can
be
unleashed
these
are
the
three
core
elements
of
our
strategy
military
effort
to
create
the
conditions
for
transition
civilian
surge
that
reinforces
positive
action
and
an
effective
partnership
with
pakistan
that
there
are
range
of
concerns
about
our
approach
so
let
me
briefly
address
few
of
the
prominent
arguments
that
have
heard
and
which
take
very
seriously
first
there
are
those
who
suggest
that
is
another
they
argue
that
it
can
not
be
and
we
better
off
cutting
our
losses
and
rapidly
withdrawing
believe
this
argument
depends
upon
false
reading
of
history
unlike
we
are
joined
by
broad
coalition
of
nations
that
the
legitimacy
of
our
action
unlike
we
are
not
facing
popular
insurgency
and
most
importantly
unlike
the
american
people
were
viciously
attacked
from
and
remain
target
for
those
same
extremists
who
are
plotting
along
its
border
to
abandon
this
area
now
and
to
rely
only
on
efforts
against
from
distance
would
significantly
hamper
our
ability
to
keep
the
pressure
on
and
create
an
unacceptable
risk
of
additional
attacks
on
our
homeland
and
our
allies
second
there
are
those
who
acknowledge
that
we
leave
in
its
current
state
but
suggest
that
we
go
forward
with
the
troops
that
we
already
have
but
this
would
simply
maintain
status
in
which
we
muddle
through
and
permit
slow
deterioration
of
conditions
there
it
would
ultimately
prove
more
costly
and
prolong
our
stay
in
because
we
would
never
be
able
to
generate
the
conditions
needed
to
train
afghan
security
forces
and
give
them
the
space
to
take
over
finally
there
are
those
who
oppose
identifying
timeframe
for
our
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
indeed
some
call
for
more
dramatic
and
escalation
of
our
war
effort
one
that
would
commit
us
to
nation
building
project
of
up
to
decade
reject
this
course
because
it
sets
goals
that
are
beyond
what
can
be
achieved
at
reasonable
cost
and
what
we
need
to
achieve
to
secure
our
interests
furthermore
the
absence
of
timeframe
for
transition
would
deny
us
any
sense
of
urgency
in
working
with
the
afghan
government
it
must
be
clear
that
afghans
will
have
to
take
responsibility
for
their
security
and
that
america
has
no
interest
in
fighting
an
endless
war
in
as
president
refuse
to
set
goals
that
go
beyond
our
responsibility
our
means
or
our
interests
and
must
weigh
all
of
the
challenges
that
our
nation
faces
do
have
the
luxury
of
committing
to
just
one
indeed
mindful
of
the
words
of
president
who
in
discussing
our
national
security
said
each
proposal
must
be
weighed
in
the
light
of
broader
consideration
the
need
to
maintain
balance
in
and
among
national
programs
over
the
past
several
years
we
have
lost
that
balance
we
failed
to
appreciate
the
connection
between
our
national
security
and
our
economy
in
the
wake
of
an
economic
crisis
too
many
of
our
and
friends
are
out
of
work
and
struggle
to
pay
the
bills
too
many
americans
are
worried
about
the
future
facing
our
children
meanwhile
competition
within
the
global
economy
has
grown
more
fierce
so
we
simply
afford
to
ignore
the
price
of
these
wars
all
told
by
the
time
took
office
the
cost
of
the
wars
in
iraq
and
approached
trillion
dollars
going
forward
am
committed
to
addressing
these
costs
openly
and
honestly
our
new
approach
in
is
likely
to
cost
us
roughly
billion
dollars
for
the
military
this
year
and
work
closely
with
congress
to
address
these
costs
as
we
work
to
bring
down
our
deficit
but
as
we
end
the
war
in
iraq
and
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
we
must
rebuild
our
strength
here
at
home
our
prosperity
provides
foundation
for
our
power
it
pays
for
our
military
it
underwrites
our
diplomacy
it
taps
the
potential
of
our
people
and
allows
investment
in
new
industry
and
it
will
allow
us
to
compete
in
this
century
as
successfully
as
we
did
in
the
last
that
why
our
troop
commitment
in
can
not
be
because
the
nation
that
am
most
interested
in
building
is
our
own
now
let
me
be
clear
none
of
this
will
be
easy
the
struggle
against
violent
extremism
will
not
be
finished
quickly
and
it
extends
well
beyond
and
pakistan
it
will
be
an
enduring
test
of
our
free
society
and
our
leadership
in
the
world
and
unlike
the
great
power
conflicts
and
clear
lines
of
division
that
defined
the
century
our
effort
will
involve
disorderly
regions
failed
states
diffuse
enemies
so
as
result
america
will
have
to
show
our
strength
in
the
way
that
we
end
wars
and
prevent
conflict
not
just
how
we
wage
wars
we
have
to
be
nimble
and
precise
in
our
use
of
military
power
where
and
its
allies
attempt
to
establish
foothold
whether
in
somalia
or
yemen
or
elsewhere
they
must
be
confronted
by
growing
pressure
and
strong
partnerships
and
we
count
on
military
might
alone
we
have
to
invest
in
our
homeland
security
because
we
capture
or
kill
every
violent
extremist
abroad
we
have
to
improve
and
better
coordinate
our
intelligence
so
that
we
stay
one
step
ahead
of
shadowy
networks
we
will
have
to
take
away
the
tools
of
mass
destruction
and
that
why
made
it
central
pillar
of
my
foreign
policy
to
secure
loose
nuclear
materials
from
terrorists
to
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
to
pursue
the
goal
of
world
without
them
because
every
nation
must
understand
that
true
security
will
never
come
from
an
endless
race
for
destructive
weapons
true
security
will
come
for
those
who
reject
them
we
will
have
to
use
diplomacy
because
no
one
nation
can
meet
the
challenges
of
an
interconnected
world
acting
alone
spent
this
year
renewing
our
alliances
and
forging
new
partnerships
and
we
have
forged
new
beginning
between
america
and
the
muslim
world
one
that
our
mutual
interest
in
breaking
cycle
of
conflict
and
that
promises
future
in
which
those
who
kill
innocents
are
isolated
by
those
who
stand
up
for
peace
and
prosperity
and
human
dignity
and
finally
we
must
draw
on
the
strength
of
our
values
for
the
challenges
that
we
face
may
have
changed
but
the
things
that
we
believe
in
must
not
and
that
why
we
must
promote
our
values
by
living
them
at
home
which
is
why
have
prohibited
torture
and
will
close
the
prison
at
bay
and
we
must
make
it
clear
to
every
man
woman
and
child
around
the
world
who
lives
under
the
dark
cloud
of
tyranny
that
america
will
speak
out
on
behalf
of
their
human
rights
and
tend
to
the
light
of
freedom
and
justice
and
opportunity
and
respect
for
the
dignity
of
all
peoples
that
is
who
we
are
that
is
the
source
the
moral
source
of
america
authority
since
the
days
of
and
the
service
and
sacrifice
of
our
grandparents
and
great
grandparents
our
country
has
borne
special
burden
in
global
affairs
we
have
spilled
american
blood
in
many
countries
on
multiple
continents
we
have
spent
our
revenue
to
help
others
rebuild
from
rubble
and
develop
their
own
economies
we
have
joined
with
others
to
develop
an
architecture
of
institutions
from
the
united
nations
to
nato
to
the
world
bank
that
provide
for
the
common
security
and
prosperity
of
human
beings
we
have
not
always
been
thanked
for
these
efforts
and
we
have
at
times
made
mistakes
but
more
than
any
other
nation
the
united
states
of
america
has
underwritten
global
security
for
over
six
decades
time
that
for
all
its
problems
has
seen
walls
come
down
and
markets
open
and
billions
lifted
from
poverty
unparalleled
scientific
progress
and
advancing
frontiers
of
human
liberty
for
unlike
the
great
powers
of
old
we
have
not
sought
world
domination
our
union
was
founded
in
resistance
to
oppression
we
do
not
seek
to
occupy
other
nations
we
will
not
claim
another
nation
resources
or
target
other
peoples
because
their
faith
or
ethnicity
is
different
from
ours
what
we
have
fought
for
and
what
we
continue
to
fight
for
is
better
future
for
our
children
and
grandchildren
and
we
believe
that
their
lives
will
be
better
if
others
sic
peoples
children
and
grandchildren
can
live
in
freedom
and
access
opportunity
as
country
we
not
as
young
and
perhaps
not
as
innocent
as
we
were
when
was
president
yet
we
are
still
heirs
to
noble
struggle
for
freedom
and
now
we
must
summon
all
of
our
might
and
moral
suasion
to
meet
the
challenges
of
new
age
in
the
end
our
security
and
leadership
does
not
come
solely
from
the
strength
of
our
arms
it
derives
from
our
people
from
the
workers
and
businesses
who
will
rebuild
our
economy
from
the
entrepreneurs
and
researchers
who
will
pioneer
new
industries
from
the
teachers
that
will
educate
our
children
and
the
service
of
those
who
work
in
our
communities
at
home
from
the
diplomats
and
peace
corps
volunteers
who
spread
hope
abroad
and
from
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
are
part
of
an
unbroken
line
of
sacrifice
that
has
made
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
reality
on
this
this
vast
and
diverse
citizenry
will
not
always
agree
on
every
issue
nor
should
we
but
also
know
that
we
as
country
can
not
sustain
our
leadership
nor
navigate
the
momentous
challenges
of
our
time
if
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
split
asunder
by
the
same
and
cynicism
and
partisanship
that
has
in
recent
times
poisoned
our
national
discourse
it
easy
to
forget
that
when
this
war
began
we
were
united
bound
together
by
the
fresh
memory
of
horrific
attack
and
by
the
determination
to
defend
our
homeland
and
the
values
we
hold
dear
refuse
to
accept
the
notion
that
we
can
not
summon
that
unity
again
believe
believe
with
every
of
my
being
that
we
as
americans
can
still
come
together
behind
common
purpose
for
our
values
are
not
simply
words
written
into
parchment
they
are
creed
that
calls
us
together
and
that
has
carried
us
through
the
darkest
of
storms
as
one
nation
as
one
people
america
we
are
passing
through
time
of
great
trial
and
the
message
that
we
send
in
the
midst
of
these
storms
must
be
clear
that
our
cause
is
just
our
resolve
unwavering
we
will
go
forward
with
the
confidence
that
right
makes
might
and
with
the
commitment
to
forge
an
america
that
is
safer
world
that
is
more
secure
and
future
that
represents
not
the
deepest
of
fears
but
the
highest
of
hopes
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
morning
president
secretary
general
fellow
delegates
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
my
to
address
you
for
the
first
time
as
the
president
of
the
united
states
come
before
you
humbled
by
the
responsibility
that
the
american
people
have
placed
upon
me
mindful
of
the
enormous
challenges
of
our
moment
in
history
and
determined
to
act
boldly
and
collectively
on
behalf
of
justice
and
prosperity
at
home
and
abroad
have
been
in
office
for
just
nine
months
though
some
days
it
seems
lot
longer
am
well
aware
of
the
expectations
that
accompany
my
presidency
around
the
world
these
expectations
are
not
about
me
rather
they
are
rooted
believe
in
discontent
with
status
that
has
allowed
us
to
be
increasingly
defined
by
our
differences
and
outpaced
by
our
problems
but
they
are
also
rooted
in
hope
the
hope
that
real
change
is
possible
and
the
hope
that
america
will
be
leader
in
bringing
about
such
change
took
office
at
time
when
many
around
the
world
had
come
to
view
america
with
and
distrust
part
of
this
was
due
to
and
misinformation
about
my
country
part
of
this
was
due
to
opposition
to
specific
policies
and
belief
that
on
certain
critical
issues
america
has
acted
unilaterally
without
regard
for
the
interests
of
others
and
this
has
fed
an
almost
reflexive
which
too
often
has
served
as
an
excuse
for
collective
inaction
now
like
all
of
you
my
responsibility
is
to
act
in
the
interest
of
my
nation
and
my
people
and
will
never
for
defending
those
interests
but
it
is
my
deeply
held
belief
that
in
the
year
more
than
at
any
point
in
human
history
the
interests
of
nations
and
peoples
are
shared
the
religious
convictions
that
we
hold
in
our
hearts
can
forge
new
bonds
among
people
or
they
can
tear
us
apart
the
technology
we
harness
can
light
the
path
to
peace
or
forever
darken
it
the
energy
we
use
can
sustain
our
planet
or
destroy
it
what
happens
to
the
hope
of
single
child
anywhere
can
enrich
our
world
or
impoverish
it
in
this
hall
we
come
from
many
places
but
we
share
common
future
no
longer
do
we
have
the
luxury
of
indulging
our
differences
to
the
exclusion
of
the
work
that
we
must
do
together
have
carried
this
message
from
london
to
ankara
from
port
of
spain
to
moscow
from
accra
to
cairo
and
it
is
what
will
speak
about
today
because
the
time
has
come
for
the
world
to
move
in
new
direction
we
must
embrace
new
era
of
engagement
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
our
work
must
begin
now
we
know
the
future
will
be
forged
by
deeds
and
not
simply
words
speeches
alone
will
not
solve
our
problems
it
will
take
persistent
action
for
those
who
question
the
character
and
cause
of
my
nation
ask
you
to
look
at
the
concrete
actions
we
have
taken
in
just
nine
months
on
my
first
day
in
office
prohibited
without
exception
or
equivocation
the
use
of
torture
by
the
united
states
of
america
ordered
the
prison
at
bay
closed
and
we
are
doing
the
hard
work
of
forging
framework
to
combat
extremism
within
the
rule
of
law
every
nation
must
know
america
will
live
its
values
and
we
will
lead
by
example
we
have
set
clear
and
focused
goal
to
work
with
all
members
of
this
body
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
and
its
extremist
allies
network
that
has
killed
thousands
of
people
of
many
faiths
and
nations
and
that
plotted
to
blow
up
this
very
building
in
and
pakistan
we
and
many
nations
here
are
helping
these
governments
develop
the
capacity
to
take
the
lead
in
this
effort
while
working
to
advance
opportunity
and
security
for
their
people
in
iraq
we
are
responsibly
ending
war
we
have
removed
american
combat
brigades
from
iraqi
cities
and
set
deadline
of
next
august
to
remove
all
our
combat
brigades
from
iraqi
territory
and
have
made
clear
that
we
will
help
iraqis
transition
to
full
responsibility
for
their
future
and
keep
our
commitment
to
remove
all
american
troops
by
the
end
of
have
outlined
comprehensive
agenda
to
seek
the
goal
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
in
moscow
the
united
states
and
russia
announced
that
we
would
pursue
substantial
reductions
in
our
strategic
warheads
and
launchers
at
the
conference
on
disarmament
we
agreed
on
work
plan
to
negotiate
an
end
to
the
production
of
fissile
materials
for
nuclear
weapons
and
this
week
my
secretary
of
state
will
become
the
first
senior
american
representative
to
the
annual
members
conference
of
the
comprehensive
test
ban
treaty
upon
taking
office
appointed
special
envoy
for
middle
east
peace
and
america
has
worked
steadily
and
aggressively
to
advance
the
cause
of
two
states
israel
and
in
which
peace
and
security
take
root
and
the
rights
of
both
israelis
and
are
respected
to
confront
climate
change
we
have
invested
billion
in
clean
energy
we
have
substantially
increased
our
standards
we
have
provided
new
incentives
for
conservation
launched
an
energy
partnership
across
the
and
moved
from
bystander
to
leader
in
international
climate
negotiations
to
overcome
an
economic
crisis
that
touches
every
corner
of
the
world
we
worked
with
the
nations
to
forge
coordinated
international
response
of
over
trillion
in
stimulus
to
bring
the
global
economy
back
from
the
brink
we
resources
that
helped
prevent
the
crisis
from
spreading
further
to
developing
countries
and
we
joined
with
others
to
launch
billion
global
food
security
initiative
that
will
lend
hand
to
those
who
need
it
most
and
help
them
build
their
own
capacity
we
also
the
united
nations
we
have
paid
our
bills
we
have
joined
the
human
rights
council
we
have
signed
the
convention
of
the
rights
of
persons
with
disabilities
we
have
fully
embraced
the
millennium
development
goals
and
we
address
our
priorities
here
in
this
institution
for
instance
through
the
security
council
meeting
that
will
chair
tomorrow
on
nuclear
and
disarmament
and
through
the
issues
that
will
discuss
today
this
is
what
we
have
already
done
but
this
is
just
beginning
some
of
our
actions
have
yielded
progress
some
have
laid
the
groundwork
for
progress
in
the
future
but
make
no
mistake
this
can
not
solely
be
america
those
who
used
to
chastise
america
for
acting
alone
in
the
world
can
not
now
stand
by
and
wait
for
america
to
solve
the
world
problems
alone
we
have
sought
in
word
and
deed
new
era
of
engagement
with
the
world
and
now
is
the
time
for
all
of
us
to
take
our
share
of
responsibility
for
global
response
to
global
challenges
now
if
we
are
honest
with
ourselves
we
need
to
admit
that
we
are
not
living
up
to
that
responsibility
consider
the
course
that
we
on
if
we
fail
to
confront
the
status
extremists
sowing
terror
in
pockets
of
the
world
protracted
conflicts
that
grind
on
and
on
genocide
mass
atrocities
more
nations
with
nuclear
weapons
melting
ice
caps
and
ravaged
populations
persistent
poverty
and
pandemic
disease
say
this
not
to
sow
fear
but
to
state
fact
the
magnitude
of
our
challenges
has
yet
to
be
met
by
the
measure
of
our
actions
this
body
was
founded
on
the
belief
that
the
nations
of
the
world
could
solve
their
problems
together
who
died
before
he
could
see
his
vision
for
this
institution
become
reality
put
it
this
way
and
quote
the
structure
of
world
peace
can
not
be
the
work
of
one
man
or
one
party
or
one
it
can
not
be
peace
of
large
nations
or
of
small
nations
it
must
be
peace
which
rests
on
the
cooperative
effort
of
the
whole
world
the
cooperative
effort
of
the
whole
world
those
words
ring
even
more
true
today
when
it
is
not
simply
peace
but
our
very
health
and
prosperity
that
we
hold
in
common
yet
we
also
know
that
this
body
is
made
up
of
sovereign
states
and
sadly
but
not
surprisingly
this
body
has
often
become
forum
for
sowing
discord
instead
of
forging
common
ground
venue
for
playing
politics
and
exploiting
grievances
rather
than
solving
problems
after
all
it
is
easy
to
walk
up
to
this
podium
and
point
figures
point
fingers
and
stoke
divisions
nothing
is
easier
than
blaming
others
for
our
troubles
and
absolving
ourselves
of
responsibility
for
our
choices
and
our
actions
anybody
can
do
that
responsibility
and
leadership
in
the
century
demand
more
in
an
era
when
our
destiny
is
shared
power
is
no
longer
game
no
one
nation
can
or
should
try
to
dominate
another
nation
no
world
order
that
elevates
one
nation
or
group
of
people
over
another
will
succeed
no
balance
of
power
among
nations
will
hold
the
traditional
divisions
between
nations
of
the
south
and
the
north
make
no
sense
in
an
interconnected
world
nor
do
alignments
of
nations
rooted
in
the
cleavages
of
cold
war
the
time
has
come
to
that
the
old
habits
the
old
arguments
are
irrelevant
to
the
challenges
faced
by
our
people
they
lead
nations
to
act
in
opposition
to
the
very
goals
that
they
claim
to
pursue
and
to
vote
often
in
this
body
against
the
interests
of
their
own
people
they
build
up
walls
between
us
and
the
future
that
our
people
seek
and
the
time
has
come
for
those
walls
to
come
down
together
we
must
build
new
coalitions
that
bridge
old
divides
coalitions
of
different
faiths
and
creeds
of
north
and
south
east
west
black
white
and
brown
the
choice
is
ours
we
can
be
remembered
as
generation
that
chose
to
drag
the
arguments
of
the
century
into
the
that
put
off
hard
choices
refused
to
look
ahead
failed
to
keep
pace
because
we
defined
ourselves
by
what
we
were
against
instead
of
what
we
were
for
or
we
can
be
generation
that
chooses
to
see
the
shoreline
beyond
the
rough
waters
ahead
that
comes
together
to
serve
the
common
interests
of
human
beings
and
finally
gives
meaning
to
the
promise
embedded
in
the
name
given
to
this
institution
the
united
nations
that
is
the
future
america
wants
future
of
peace
and
prosperity
that
we
can
only
reach
if
we
that
all
nations
have
rights
but
all
nations
have
responsibilities
as
well
that
is
the
bargain
that
makes
this
work
that
must
be
the
guiding
principle
of
international
cooperation
today
let
me
put
forward
four
pillars
that
believe
are
fundamental
to
the
future
that
we
want
for
our
children
and
disarmament
the
promotion
of
peace
and
security
the
preservation
of
our
planet
and
global
economy
that
advances
opportunity
for
all
people
first
we
must
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
seek
the
goal
of
world
without
them
this
institution
was
founded
at
the
dawn
of
the
atomic
age
in
part
because
man
capacity
to
kill
had
to
be
contained
for
decades
we
averted
disaster
even
under
the
shadow
of
superpower
but
today
the
threat
of
proliferation
is
growing
in
scope
and
complexity
if
we
fail
to
act
we
will
invite
nuclear
arms
races
in
every
region
and
the
prospect
of
wars
and
acts
of
terror
on
scale
that
we
can
hardly
imagine
fragile
consensus
stands
in
the
way
of
this
frightening
outcome
and
that
is
the
basic
bargain
that
shapes
the
nuclear
treaty
it
says
that
all
nations
have
the
right
to
peaceful
nuclear
energy
that
nations
with
nuclear
weapons
have
responsibility
to
move
toward
disarmament
and
those
without
them
have
the
responsibility
to
forsake
them
the
next
months
could
be
pivotal
in
determining
whether
this
compact
will
be
strengthened
or
will
slowly
dissolve
america
intends
to
keep
our
end
of
the
bargain
we
will
pursue
new
agreement
with
russia
to
substantially
reduce
our
strategic
warheads
and
launchers
we
will
move
forward
with
ratification
of
the
test
ban
treaty
and
work
with
others
to
bring
the
treaty
into
force
so
that
nuclear
testing
is
permanently
prohibited
we
will
complete
nuclear
posture
review
that
opens
the
door
to
deeper
cuts
and
reduces
the
role
of
nuclear
weapons
and
we
will
call
upon
countries
to
begin
negotiations
in
january
on
treaty
to
end
the
production
of
fissile
material
for
weapons
will
also
host
summit
next
april
that
reaffirms
each
nation
responsibility
to
secure
nuclear
material
on
its
territory
and
to
help
those
who
because
we
must
never
allow
single
nuclear
device
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
violent
extremist
and
we
will
work
to
strengthen
the
institutions
and
initiatives
that
combat
nuclear
smuggling
and
theft
all
of
this
must
support
efforts
to
strengthen
the
those
nations
that
refuse
to
live
up
to
their
obligations
must
face
consequences
let
me
be
clear
this
is
not
about
out
individual
nations
it
is
about
standing
up
for
the
rights
of
all
nations
that
do
live
up
to
their
responsibilities
because
world
in
which
inspections
are
avoided
and
the
united
nation
demands
are
ignored
will
leave
all
people
less
safe
and
all
nations
less
secure
in
their
actions
to
date
the
governments
of
north
korea
and
iran
threaten
to
take
us
down
this
dangerous
slope
we
respect
their
rights
as
members
of
the
community
of
nations
said
before
and
will
repeat
am
committed
to
diplomacy
that
opens
path
to
greater
prosperity
and
more
secure
peace
for
both
nations
if
they
live
up
to
their
obligations
but
if
the
governments
of
iran
and
north
korea
choose
to
ignore
international
standards
if
they
put
the
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
ahead
of
regional
stability
and
the
security
and
opportunity
of
their
own
people
if
they
are
oblivious
to
the
dangers
of
escalating
nuclear
arms
races
in
both
east
asia
and
the
middle
east
then
they
must
be
held
accountable
the
world
must
stand
together
to
demonstrate
that
international
law
is
not
an
empty
promise
and
that
treaties
will
be
enforced
we
must
insist
that
the
future
does
not
belong
to
fear
that
brings
me
to
the
second
pillar
for
our
future
the
pursuit
of
peace
the
united
nations
was
born
of
the
belief
that
the
people
of
the
world
can
live
their
lives
raise
their
families
and
resolve
their
differences
peacefully
and
yet
we
know
that
in
too
many
parts
of
the
world
this
ideal
remains
an
abstraction
distant
dream
we
can
either
accept
that
outcome
as
inevitable
and
tolerate
constant
and
crippling
conflict
or
we
can
that
the
yearning
for
peace
is
universal
and
reassert
our
resolve
to
end
conflicts
around
the
world
that
effort
must
begin
with
an
unshakeable
determination
that
the
murder
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
will
never
be
tolerated
on
this
no
one
can
be
there
can
be
no
dispute
the
violent
extremists
who
promote
conflict
by
distorting
faith
have
discredited
and
isolated
themselves
they
offer
nothing
but
hatred
and
destruction
in
confronting
them
america
will
forge
lasting
partnerships
to
target
terrorists
share
intelligence
and
coordinate
law
enforcement
and
protect
our
people
we
will
permit
no
safe
haven
for
to
launch
attacks
from
or
any
other
nation
we
will
stand
by
our
friends
on
the
front
lines
as
we
and
many
nations
will
do
in
pledging
support
for
the
people
tomorrow
and
we
will
pursue
positive
engagement
that
builds
bridges
among
faiths
and
new
partnerships
for
opportunity
our
efforts
to
promote
peace
however
can
not
be
limited
to
defeating
violent
extremists
for
the
most
powerful
weapon
in
our
arsenal
is
the
hope
of
human
beings
the
belief
that
the
future
belongs
to
those
who
would
build
and
not
destroy
the
confidence
that
conflicts
can
end
and
new
day
can
begin
and
that
is
why
we
will
support
we
will
strengthen
our
support
for
effective
peacekeeping
while
our
efforts
to
prevent
conflicts
before
they
take
hold
we
will
pursue
lasting
peace
in
sudan
through
support
for
the
people
of
and
the
implementation
of
the
comprehensive
peace
agreement
so
that
we
secure
the
peace
that
the
people
deserve
and
in
countries
ravaged
by
violence
from
haiti
to
congo
to
east
we
will
work
with
the
and
other
partners
to
support
an
enduring
peace
will
also
continue
to
seek
just
and
lasting
peace
between
israel
and
the
arab
world
we
will
continue
to
work
on
that
issue
yesterday
had
constructive
meeting
with
prime
minister
and
president
we
have
made
some
progress
have
strengthened
their
efforts
on
security
israelis
have
facilitated
greater
freedom
of
movement
for
the
as
result
of
these
efforts
on
both
sides
the
economy
in
the
west
bank
has
begun
to
grow
but
more
progress
is
needed
we
continue
to
call
on
to
end
incitement
against
israel
and
we
continue
to
that
america
does
not
accept
the
legitimacy
of
continued
israeli
settlements
the
time
has
come
the
time
has
come
to
negotiations
without
preconditions
that
address
the
permanent
status
issues
security
for
israelis
and
borders
refugees
and
and
the
goal
is
clear
two
states
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
jewish
state
of
israel
with
true
security
for
all
israelis
and
viable
independent
state
with
contiguous
territory
that
ends
the
occupation
that
began
in
and
the
potential
of
the
people
as
we
pursue
this
goal
we
will
also
pursue
peace
between
israel
and
lebanon
israel
and
syria
and
broader
peace
between
israel
and
its
many
in
pursuit
of
that
goal
we
will
develop
regional
initiatives
with
multilateral
participation
alongside
bilateral
negotiations
now
am
not
know
this
will
be
difficult
but
all
of
us
not
just
the
israelis
and
the
but
all
of
us
must
decide
whether
we
are
serious
about
peace
or
whether
we
will
only
lend
it
lip
service
to
break
the
old
patterns
to
break
the
cycle
of
insecurity
and
despair
all
of
us
must
say
publicly
what
we
would
acknowledge
in
private
the
united
states
does
israel
no
when
we
fail
to
couple
an
unwavering
commitment
to
its
security
with
an
insistence
that
israel
respect
the
legitimate
claims
and
rights
of
the
and
and
nations
within
this
body
do
the
no
when
they
choose
vitriolic
attacks
against
israel
over
constructive
willingness
to
israel
legitimacy
and
its
right
to
exist
in
peace
and
security
we
must
remember
that
the
greatest
price
of
this
conflict
is
not
paid
by
us
it
not
paid
by
politicians
it
paid
by
the
israeli
girl
in
who
closes
her
eyes
in
fear
that
rocket
will
take
her
life
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
paid
for
by
the
boy
in
who
has
no
clean
water
and
no
country
to
call
his
own
these
are
all
god
children
and
after
all
the
politics
and
all
the
posturing
this
is
about
the
right
of
every
human
being
to
live
with
dignity
and
security
that
is
lesson
embedded
in
the
three
great
faiths
that
call
one
small
slice
of
earth
the
holy
land
and
that
is
why
even
though
there
will
be
setbacks
and
false
starts
and
tough
days
will
not
waver
in
my
pursuit
of
peace
third
we
must
that
in
the
century
there
will
be
no
peace
unless
we
take
responsibility
for
the
preservation
of
our
planet
and
thank
the
secretary
general
for
hosting
the
subject
of
climate
change
yesterday
the
danger
posed
by
climate
change
can
not
be
denied
our
responsibility
to
meet
it
must
not
be
deferred
if
we
continue
down
our
current
course
every
member
of
this
assembly
will
see
irreversible
changes
within
their
borders
our
efforts
to
end
conflicts
will
be
eclipsed
by
wars
over
refugees
and
resources
development
will
be
devastated
by
drought
and
famine
land
that
human
beings
have
lived
on
for
millennia
will
disappear
future
generations
will
look
back
and
wonder
why
we
refused
to
act
why
we
failed
to
pass
on
why
we
failed
to
pass
on
an
environment
that
was
worthy
of
our
inheritance
and
that
is
why
the
days
when
america
dragged
its
feet
on
this
issue
are
over
we
will
move
forward
with
investments
to
transform
our
energy
economy
while
providing
incentives
to
make
clean
energy
the
profitable
kind
of
energy
we
will
press
ahead
with
deep
cuts
in
emissions
to
reach
the
goals
that
we
set
for
and
eventually
we
will
continue
to
promote
renewable
energy
and
efficiency
and
share
new
technologies
with
countries
around
the
world
and
we
will
seize
every
opportunity
for
progress
to
address
this
threat
in
cooperative
effort
with
the
entire
world
and
those
wealthy
nations
that
did
so
much
damage
to
the
environment
in
the
century
must
accept
our
obligation
to
lead
but
responsibility
does
not
end
there
while
we
must
acknowledge
the
need
for
differentiated
responses
any
effort
to
curb
carbon
emissions
must
include
the
carbon
emitters
who
can
do
more
to
reduce
their
air
pollution
without
inhibiting
growth
and
any
effort
that
fails
to
help
the
poorest
nations
both
adapt
to
the
problems
that
climate
change
have
already
wrought
and
help
them
travel
path
of
clean
development
simply
will
not
work
it
hard
to
change
something
as
fundamental
as
how
we
use
energy
know
that
it
even
harder
to
do
so
in
the
midst
of
global
recession
certainly
it
will
be
tempting
to
sit
back
and
wait
for
others
to
move
first
but
we
can
not
make
this
journey
unless
we
all
move
forward
together
as
we
head
into
let
us
resolve
to
focus
on
what
each
of
us
can
do
for
the
sake
of
our
common
future
and
this
leads
me
to
the
final
pillar
that
must
fortify
our
future
global
economy
that
advances
opportunity
for
all
people
the
world
is
still
recovering
from
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
in
america
we
see
the
engine
of
growth
beginning
to
churn
and
yet
many
still
struggle
to
find
job
or
pay
their
bills
across
the
globe
we
find
promising
signs
but
little
certainty
about
what
lies
ahead
and
far
too
many
people
in
far
too
many
places
live
through
the
daily
crises
that
challenge
our
humanity
the
despair
of
an
empty
stomach
the
thirst
brought
on
by
dwindling
water
supplies
the
injustice
of
child
dying
from
treatable
disease
or
mother
losing
her
life
as
she
gives
birth
in
we
will
work
with
the
world
largest
economies
to
chart
course
for
growth
that
is
balanced
and
sustained
that
means
vigilance
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
let
up
until
our
people
are
back
to
work
that
means
taking
steps
to
rekindle
demand
so
that
global
recovery
can
be
sustained
and
that
means
setting
new
rules
of
the
road
and
strengthening
regulation
for
all
financial
so
that
we
put
an
end
to
the
greed
and
the
excess
and
the
abuse
that
led
us
into
this
disaster
and
prevent
crisis
like
this
from
ever
happening
again
at
time
of
such
interdependence
we
have
moral
and
pragmatic
interest
however
in
broader
questions
of
development
the
questions
of
development
that
existed
even
before
this
crisis
happened
and
so
america
will
continue
our
historic
effort
to
help
people
feed
themselves
we
have
set
aside
billion
to
carry
forward
the
fight
against
to
end
deaths
from
tuberculosis
and
malaria
to
eradicate
polio
and
to
strengthen
public
health
systems
we
are
joining
with
other
countries
to
contribute
vaccines
to
the
world
health
we
will
integrate
more
economies
into
system
of
global
trade
we
will
support
the
millennium
development
goals
and
approach
next
year
summit
with
global
plan
to
make
them
reality
and
we
will
set
our
sights
on
the
eradication
of
extreme
poverty
in
our
time
now
is
the
time
for
all
of
us
to
do
our
part
growth
will
not
be
sustained
or
shared
unless
all
nations
embrace
their
responsibilities
and
that
means
that
wealthy
nations
must
open
their
markets
to
more
goods
and
extend
hand
to
those
with
less
while
reforming
international
institutions
to
give
more
nations
greater
voice
and
developing
nations
must
root
out
the
corruption
that
is
an
obstacle
to
progress
for
opportunity
can
not
thrive
where
individuals
are
oppressed
and
business
have
to
pay
bribes
that
is
why
we
support
honest
police
and
independent
judges
civil
society
and
vibrant
private
sector
our
goal
is
simple
global
economy
in
which
growth
is
sustained
and
opportunity
is
available
to
all
now
the
changes
that
spoken
about
today
will
not
be
easy
to
make
and
they
will
not
be
simply
by
leaders
like
us
coming
together
in
forums
like
this
as
useful
as
that
may
be
for
as
in
any
assembly
of
members
real
change
can
only
come
through
the
people
we
represent
that
is
why
we
must
do
the
hard
work
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
progress
in
our
own
capitals
that
where
we
will
build
the
consensus
to
end
conflicts
and
to
harness
technology
for
peaceful
purposes
to
change
the
way
we
use
energy
and
to
promote
growth
that
can
be
sustained
and
shared
believe
that
the
people
of
the
world
want
this
future
for
their
children
and
that
is
why
we
must
champion
those
principles
which
ensure
that
governments
reflect
the
will
of
the
people
these
principles
can
not
be
afterthoughts
democracy
and
human
rights
are
essential
to
achieving
each
of
the
goals
that
discussed
today
because
governments
of
the
people
and
by
the
people
are
more
likely
to
act
in
the
broader
interests
of
their
own
people
rather
than
narrow
interests
of
those
in
power
the
test
of
our
leadership
will
not
be
the
degree
to
which
we
feed
the
fears
and
old
hatreds
of
our
people
true
leadership
will
not
be
measured
by
the
ability
to
muzzle
dissent
or
to
intimidate
and
harass
political
opponents
at
home
the
people
of
the
world
want
change
they
will
not
long
tolerate
those
who
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
this
assembly
charter
commits
each
of
us
and
quote
to
reaffirm
faith
in
fundamental
human
rights
in
the
dignity
and
worth
of
the
human
person
in
the
equal
rights
of
men
and
women
among
those
rights
is
the
freedom
to
speak
your
mind
and
worship
as
you
please
the
promise
of
equality
of
the
races
and
the
opportunity
for
women
and
girls
to
pursue
their
own
potential
the
ability
of
citizens
to
have
say
in
how
you
are
governed
and
to
have
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice
for
just
as
no
nation
should
be
forced
to
accept
the
tyranny
of
another
nation
no
individual
should
be
forced
to
accept
the
tyranny
of
their
own
people
as
an
african
american
will
never
forget
that
would
not
be
here
today
without
the
steady
pursuit
of
more
perfect
union
in
my
country
and
that
guides
my
belief
that
no
matter
how
dark
the
day
may
seem
transformative
change
can
be
forged
by
those
who
choose
to
side
with
justice
and
pledge
that
america
will
always
stand
with
those
who
stand
up
for
their
dignity
and
their
rights
for
the
student
who
seeks
to
learn
the
voter
who
demands
to
be
heard
the
innocent
who
longs
to
be
free
the
oppressed
who
yearns
to
be
equal
democracy
can
not
be
imposed
on
any
nation
from
the
outside
each
society
must
search
for
its
own
path
and
no
path
is
perfect
each
country
will
pursue
path
rooted
in
the
culture
of
its
people
and
in
its
past
traditions
and
admit
that
america
has
too
often
been
selective
in
its
promotion
of
democracy
but
that
does
not
weaken
our
commitment
it
only
reinforces
it
there
are
basic
principles
that
are
universal
there
are
certain
truths
which
are
and
the
united
states
of
america
will
never
waver
in
our
efforts
to
stand
up
for
the
right
of
people
everywhere
to
determine
their
own
destiny
years
ago
weary
spoke
to
the
american
people
in
his
fourth
and
final
inaugural
address
after
years
of
war
he
sought
to
sum
up
the
lessons
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
terrible
suffering
the
enormous
sacrifice
that
had
taken
place
we
have
learned
he
said
to
be
citizens
of
the
world
members
of
the
human
community
the
united
nations
was
built
by
men
and
women
like
from
every
corner
of
the
world
from
africa
and
asia
from
europe
to
the
these
architects
of
international
cooperation
had
an
idealism
that
was
anything
but
it
was
rooted
in
the
lessons
of
war
rooted
in
the
wisdom
that
nations
could
advance
their
interests
by
acting
together
instead
of
splitting
apart
now
it
falls
to
us
for
this
institution
will
be
what
we
make
of
it
the
united
nations
does
extraordinary
good
around
the
world
feeding
the
hungry
caring
for
the
sick
mending
places
that
have
been
broken
but
it
also
struggles
to
enforce
its
will
and
to
live
up
to
the
ideals
of
its
founding
believe
that
those
imperfections
are
not
reason
to
walk
away
from
this
institution
they
are
calling
to
redouble
our
efforts
the
united
nations
can
either
be
place
where
we
bicker
about
outdated
grievances
or
forge
common
ground
place
where
we
focus
on
what
drives
us
apart
or
what
brings
us
together
place
where
we
indulge
tyranny
or
source
of
moral
authority
in
short
the
united
nations
can
be
an
institution
that
is
disconnected
from
what
matters
in
the
lives
of
our
citizens
or
it
can
be
an
indispensable
factor
in
advancing
the
interests
of
the
people
we
serve
we
have
reached
pivotal
moment
the
united
states
stands
ready
to
begin
new
chapter
of
international
cooperation
one
that
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
all
nations
and
so
with
confidence
in
our
cause
and
with
commitment
to
our
values
we
call
on
all
nations
to
join
us
in
building
the
future
that
our
people
so
richly
deserve
thank
you
very
much
everybody
secretary
gates
admiral
and
members
of
the
armed
forces
fellow
americans
family
and
friends
of
those
that
we
lost
this
day
and
are
deeply
humbled
to
be
with
you
eight
have
come
and
gone
nearly
days
have
passed
almost
one
for
each
of
those
taken
from
us
but
no
turning
of
the
seasons
can
diminish
the
pain
and
the
loss
of
that
day
no
passage
of
time
and
no
dark
skies
can
ever
dull
the
meaning
of
this
moment
so
on
this
solemn
day
at
this
sacred
hour
once
more
we
pause
once
more
we
pray
as
nation
and
as
people
in
city
streets
where
our
two
towers
were
turned
to
ashes
and
dust
in
quiet
field
where
plane
fell
from
the
sky
and
here
where
single
stone
of
this
building
is
still
blackened
by
the
fires
we
remember
with
reverence
the
lives
we
lost
we
read
their
names
we
press
their
photos
to
our
hearts
and
on
this
day
that
marks
their
death
we
recall
the
beauty
and
meaning
of
their
lives
men
and
women
and
children
of
every
and
every
creed
from
across
our
nation
and
from
more
than
others
they
were
innocent
harming
no
one
they
went
about
their
daily
lives
gone
in
horrible
instant
they
now
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
forever
we
all
those
who
gave
their
lives
so
that
others
might
live
and
all
the
survivors
who
battled
burns
and
wounds
and
helped
each
other
rebuild
their
lives
men
and
women
who
gave
life
to
that
most
simple
of
rules
am
my
brother
keeper
am
my
sister
keeper
we
pay
tribute
to
the
service
of
new
generation
young
americans
raised
in
time
of
peace
and
plenty
who
saw
their
nation
in
its
hour
of
need
and
said
choose
to
serve
will
do
my
part
and
once
more
we
grieve
for
you
and
your
families
no
words
can
ease
the
ache
of
your
heart
no
deeds
can
fill
the
empty
places
in
your
homes
but
on
this
day
and
all
that
follow
you
may
find
solace
in
the
memory
of
those
you
loved
and
know
that
you
have
the
unending
support
of
the
american
people
scripture
teaches
us
hard
truth
the
mountains
may
fall
and
the
earth
may
give
way
the
flesh
and
the
heart
may
fail
but
after
all
our
suffering
god
and
grace
will
restore
you
and
make
you
strong
firm
and
steadfast
so
it
is
so
it
has
been
for
these
families
so
it
must
be
for
our
nation
let
us
renew
our
resolve
against
those
who
perpetrated
this
barbaric
act
and
who
plot
against
us
still
in
of
our
nation
we
will
never
waver
in
pursuit
of
and
its
extremist
allies
we
will
never
falter
let
us
renew
our
commitment
to
all
those
who
serve
in
our
our
courageous
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
their
families
and
all
those
who
protect
us
here
at
home
mindful
that
the
work
of
protecting
america
is
never
finished
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
america
safe
let
us
renew
the
true
spirit
of
that
day
not
the
human
capacity
for
evil
but
the
human
capacity
for
good
not
the
desire
to
destroy
but
the
impulse
to
save
and
to
serve
and
to
build
on
this
first
national
day
of
service
and
remembrance
we
can
summon
once
more
that
ordinary
goodness
of
america
to
serve
our
communities
to
strengthen
our
country
and
to
better
our
world
most
of
all
on
day
when
others
sought
to
sap
our
confidence
let
us
renew
our
common
purpose
let
us
remember
how
we
came
together
as
one
nation
as
one
people
as
americans
united
not
only
in
our
grief
but
in
our
resolve
to
stand
with
one
another
to
stand
up
for
the
country
we
all
love
this
may
be
the
greatest
lesson
of
this
day
the
strongest
rebuke
to
those
who
attacked
us
the
highest
tribute
to
those
taken
from
us
that
such
sense
of
purpose
need
not
be
fleeting
moment
it
can
be
lasting
virtue
for
through
their
own
lives
and
through
you
the
loved
ones
that
they
left
behind
the
men
and
women
who
lost
their
lives
eight
years
ago
today
leave
legacy
that
still
shines
brightly
in
the
darkness
and
that
calls
on
all
of
us
to
be
strong
and
firm
and
united
that
is
our
calling
today
and
in
all
the
still
to
come
may
god
bless
you
and
comfort
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
madam
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
and
the
american
people
when
spoke
here
last
winter
this
nation
was
facing
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
we
were
losing
an
average
of
jobs
per
month
credit
was
frozen
and
our
financial
system
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
as
any
american
who
is
still
looking
for
work
or
way
to
pay
their
bills
will
tell
you
we
are
by
no
means
out
of
the
woods
full
and
vibrant
recovery
is
still
many
months
away
and
will
not
let
up
until
those
americans
who
seek
jobs
can
find
them
until
those
businesses
that
seek
capital
and
credit
can
thrive
until
all
responsible
homeowners
can
stay
in
their
homes
that
is
our
ultimate
goal
but
thanks
to
the
bold
and
decisive
action
we
taken
since
january
can
stand
here
with
confidence
and
say
that
we
have
pulled
this
economy
back
from
the
brink
want
to
thank
the
members
of
this
body
for
your
efforts
and
your
support
in
these
last
several
months
and
especially
those
who
taken
the
difficult
votes
that
have
put
us
on
path
to
recovery
also
want
to
thank
the
american
people
for
their
patience
and
resolve
during
this
trying
time
for
our
nation
but
we
did
not
come
here
just
to
clean
up
crises
we
came
here
to
build
future
so
tonight
return
to
speak
to
all
of
you
about
an
issue
that
is
central
to
that
future
and
that
is
the
issue
of
health
care
am
not
the
first
president
to
take
up
this
cause
but
am
determined
to
be
the
last
it
has
now
been
nearly
century
since
first
called
for
health
care
reform
and
ever
since
nearly
every
president
and
congress
whether
democrat
or
republican
has
attempted
to
meet
this
challenge
in
some
way
bill
for
comprehensive
health
reform
was
first
introduced
by
john
in
years
later
his
son
continues
to
introduce
that
same
bill
at
the
beginning
of
each
session
our
collective
failure
to
meet
this
challenge
year
after
year
decade
after
decade
has
led
us
to
the
breaking
point
everyone
understands
the
extraordinary
hardships
that
are
placed
on
the
uninsured
who
live
every
day
just
one
accident
or
illness
away
from
bankruptcy
these
are
not
primarily
people
on
welfare
these
are
americans
some
get
insurance
on
the
job
others
are
and
afford
it
since
buying
insurance
on
your
own
costs
you
three
times
as
much
as
the
coverage
you
get
from
your
employer
many
other
americans
who
are
willing
and
able
to
pay
are
still
denied
insurance
due
to
previous
illnesses
or
conditions
that
insurance
companies
decide
are
too
risky
or
too
expensive
to
cover
we
are
the
only
democracy
the
only
advanced
democracy
on
earth
the
only
wealthy
nation
that
allows
such
hardship
for
millions
of
its
people
there
are
now
more
than
million
american
citizens
who
can
not
get
coverage
in
just
period
one
in
every
three
americans
goes
without
health
care
coverage
at
some
point
and
every
day
americans
lose
their
coverage
in
other
words
it
can
happen
to
anyone
but
the
problem
that
plagues
the
health
care
system
is
not
just
problem
for
the
uninsured
those
who
do
have
insurance
have
never
had
less
security
and
stability
than
they
do
today
more
and
more
americans
worry
that
if
you
move
lose
your
job
or
change
your
job
you
lose
your
health
insurance
too
more
and
more
americans
pay
their
premiums
only
to
discover
that
their
insurance
company
has
dropped
their
coverage
when
they
get
sick
or
pay
the
full
cost
of
care
it
happens
every
day
one
man
from
illinois
lost
his
coverage
in
the
middle
of
chemotherapy
because
his
insurer
found
that
he
had
reported
gallstones
that
he
did
even
know
about
they
delayed
his
treatment
and
he
died
because
of
it
another
woman
from
texas
was
about
to
get
double
mastectomy
when
her
insurance
company
her
policy
because
she
forgot
to
declare
case
of
acne
by
the
time
she
had
her
insurance
reinstated
her
breast
cancer
had
more
than
doubled
in
size
that
is
it
is
wrong
and
no
one
should
be
treated
that
way
in
the
united
states
of
america
then
there
the
problem
of
rising
cost
we
spend
one
and
half
times
more
per
person
on
health
care
than
any
other
country
but
we
are
any
healthier
for
it
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
insurance
premiums
have
gone
up
three
times
faster
than
wages
it
why
so
many
employers
especially
small
businesses
are
forcing
their
employees
to
pay
more
for
insurance
or
are
dropping
their
coverage
entirely
it
why
so
many
aspiring
entrepreneurs
can
not
afford
to
open
business
in
the
first
place
and
why
american
businesses
that
compete
internationally
like
our
are
at
huge
disadvantage
and
it
why
those
of
us
with
health
insurance
are
also
paying
hidden
and
growing
tax
for
those
without
it
about
per
year
that
pays
for
somebody
else
emergency
room
and
charitable
care
finally
our
health
care
system
is
placing
an
unsustainable
burden
on
taxpayers
when
health
care
costs
grow
at
the
rate
they
have
it
puts
greater
pressure
on
programs
like
and
if
we
do
nothing
to
slow
these
costs
we
will
eventually
be
spending
more
on
and
than
every
other
government
program
combined
put
simply
our
health
care
problem
is
our
deficit
problem
nothing
else
even
comes
close
nothing
else
now
these
are
the
facts
nobody
disputes
them
we
know
we
must
reform
this
system
the
question
is
how
there
are
those
on
the
left
who
believe
that
the
only
way
to
fix
the
system
is
through
system
like
canada
where
we
would
severely
restrict
the
private
insurance
market
and
have
the
government
provide
coverage
for
everybody
on
the
right
there
are
those
who
argue
that
we
should
end
systems
and
leave
individuals
to
buy
health
insurance
on
their
own
said
have
to
say
that
there
are
arguments
to
be
made
for
both
these
approaches
but
either
one
would
represent
radical
shift
that
would
disrupt
the
health
care
most
people
currently
have
since
health
care
represents
of
our
economy
believe
it
makes
more
sense
to
build
on
what
works
and
fix
what
does
rather
than
try
to
build
an
entirely
new
system
from
scratch
and
that
is
precisely
what
those
of
you
in
congress
have
tried
to
do
over
the
past
several
months
during
that
time
we
seen
washington
at
its
best
and
at
its
worst
we
seen
many
in
this
chamber
work
tirelessly
for
the
better
part
of
this
year
to
offer
thoughtful
ideas
about
how
to
achieve
reform
of
the
five
committees
asked
to
develop
bills
four
have
completed
their
work
and
the
senate
finance
committee
announced
today
that
it
will
move
forward
next
week
that
has
never
happened
before
our
overall
efforts
have
been
supported
by
an
unprecedented
coalition
of
doctors
and
nurses
hospitals
seniors
groups
and
even
drug
companies
many
of
whom
opposed
reform
in
the
past
and
there
is
agreement
in
this
chamber
on
about
percent
of
what
needs
to
be
done
putting
us
closer
to
the
goal
of
reform
than
we
have
ever
been
but
what
we
also
seen
in
these
last
months
is
the
same
partisan
spectacle
that
only
hardens
the
disdain
many
americans
have
towards
their
own
government
instead
of
honest
debate
we
seen
scare
tactics
some
have
dug
into
unyielding
ideological
camps
that
offer
no
hope
of
compromise
too
many
have
used
this
as
an
opportunity
to
score
political
points
even
if
it
robs
the
country
of
our
opportunity
to
solve
challenge
and
out
of
this
blizzard
of
charges
and
confusion
has
reigned
well
the
time
for
bickering
is
over
the
time
for
games
has
passed
now
is
the
season
for
action
now
is
when
we
must
bring
the
best
ideas
of
both
parties
together
and
show
the
american
people
that
we
can
still
do
what
we
were
sent
here
to
do
now
is
the
time
to
deliver
on
health
care
now
is
the
time
to
deliver
on
health
care
the
plan
announcing
tonight
would
meet
three
basic
goals
it
will
provide
more
security
and
stability
to
those
who
have
health
insurance
it
will
provide
insurance
for
those
who
do
and
it
will
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
costs
for
our
families
our
businesses
and
our
government
it
plan
that
asks
everyone
to
take
responsibility
for
meeting
this
challenge
not
just
government
not
just
insurance
companies
but
everybody
including
employers
and
individuals
and
it
plan
that
incorporates
ideas
from
senators
and
congressmen
from
democrats
and
republicans
and
yes
from
some
of
my
opponents
in
both
the
primary
and
general
election
here
are
the
details
that
every
american
needs
to
know
about
this
plan
first
if
you
are
among
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
americans
who
already
have
health
insurance
through
your
job
or
or
or
the
nothing
in
this
plan
will
require
you
or
your
employer
to
change
the
coverage
or
the
doctor
you
have
let
me
repeat
this
nothing
in
our
plan
requires
you
to
change
what
you
have
what
this
plan
will
do
is
make
the
insurance
you
have
work
better
for
you
under
this
plan
it
will
be
against
the
law
for
insurance
companies
to
deny
you
coverage
because
of
condition
as
soon
as
sign
this
bill
it
will
be
against
the
law
for
insurance
companies
to
drop
your
coverage
when
you
get
sick
or
water
it
down
when
you
need
it
the
most
they
will
no
longer
be
able
to
place
some
arbitrary
cap
on
the
amount
of
coverage
you
can
receive
in
given
year
or
in
lifetime
we
will
place
limit
on
how
much
you
can
be
charged
for
expenses
because
in
the
united
states
of
america
no
one
should
go
broke
because
they
get
sick
and
insurance
companies
will
be
required
to
cover
with
no
extra
charge
routine
checkups
and
preventive
care
like
and
because
there
no
reason
we
should
be
catching
diseases
like
breast
cancer
and
colon
cancer
before
they
get
worse
that
makes
sense
it
saves
money
and
it
saves
lives
now
that
what
americans
who
have
health
insurance
can
expect
from
this
plan
more
security
and
more
stability
now
if
you
one
of
the
tens
of
millions
of
americans
who
do
currently
have
health
insurance
the
second
part
of
this
plan
will
finally
offer
you
quality
affordable
choices
if
you
lose
your
job
or
you
change
your
job
you
be
able
to
get
coverage
if
you
strike
out
on
your
own
and
start
small
business
you
be
able
to
get
coverage
we
do
this
by
creating
new
insurance
exchange
marketplace
where
individuals
and
small
businesses
will
be
able
to
shop
for
health
insurance
at
competitive
prices
insurance
companies
will
have
an
incentive
to
participate
in
this
exchange
because
it
lets
them
compete
for
millions
of
new
customers
as
one
big
group
these
customers
will
have
greater
leverage
to
bargain
with
the
insurance
companies
for
better
prices
and
quality
coverage
this
is
how
large
companies
and
government
employees
get
affordable
insurance
it
how
everyone
in
this
congress
gets
affordable
insurance
and
it
time
to
give
every
american
the
same
opportunity
that
we
give
ourselves
now
for
those
individuals
and
small
businesses
who
still
afford
the
insurance
available
in
the
exchange
we
provide
tax
credits
the
size
of
which
will
be
based
on
your
need
and
all
insurance
companies
that
want
access
to
this
new
marketplace
will
have
to
abide
by
the
consumer
protections
already
mentioned
this
exchange
will
take
effect
in
four
years
which
will
give
us
time
to
do
it
right
in
the
meantime
for
those
americans
who
get
insurance
today
because
they
have
medical
conditions
we
will
immediately
offer
coverage
that
will
protect
you
against
financial
ruin
if
you
become
seriously
ill
this
was
good
idea
when
senator
john
proposed
it
in
the
campaign
it
good
idea
now
and
we
should
all
embrace
it
now
even
if
we
provide
these
affordable
options
there
may
be
those
especially
the
young
and
the
healthy
who
still
want
to
take
the
risk
and
go
without
coverage
there
may
still
be
companies
that
refuse
to
do
right
by
their
workers
by
giving
them
coverage
the
problem
is
such
irresponsible
costs
all
the
rest
of
us
money
if
there
are
affordable
options
and
people
still
do
sign
up
for
health
insurance
it
means
we
pay
for
these
people
expensive
emergency
room
visits
if
some
businesses
do
provide
workers
health
care
it
forces
the
rest
of
us
to
pick
up
the
tab
when
their
workers
get
sick
and
gives
those
businesses
an
unfair
advantage
over
their
competitors
and
unless
everybody
does
their
part
many
of
the
insurance
reforms
we
seek
especially
requiring
insurance
companies
to
cover
conditions
just
be
achieved
and
that
why
under
my
plan
individuals
will
be
required
to
carry
basic
health
insurance
just
as
most
states
require
you
to
carry
auto
insurance
likewise
likewise
businesses
will
be
required
to
either
offer
their
workers
health
care
or
chip
in
to
help
cover
the
cost
of
their
workers
there
will
be
hardship
waiver
for
those
individuals
who
still
afford
coverage
and
percent
of
all
small
businesses
because
of
their
size
and
narrow
profit
margin
would
be
exempt
from
these
requirements
but
we
have
large
businesses
and
individuals
who
can
afford
coverage
game
the
system
by
avoiding
responsibility
to
themselves
or
their
employees
improving
our
health
care
system
only
works
if
everybody
does
their
part
and
while
there
remain
some
significant
details
to
be
ironed
out
believe
believe
broad
consensus
exists
for
the
aspects
of
the
plan
just
outlined
consumer
protections
for
those
with
insurance
an
exchange
that
allows
individuals
and
small
businesses
to
purchase
affordable
coverage
and
requirement
that
people
who
can
afford
insurance
get
insurance
and
have
no
doubt
that
these
reforms
would
greatly
benefit
americans
from
all
walks
of
life
as
well
as
the
economy
as
whole
still
given
all
the
misinformation
that
been
spread
over
the
past
few
months
that
many
americans
have
grown
nervous
about
reform
so
tonight
want
to
address
some
of
the
key
controversies
that
are
still
out
there
some
of
people
concerns
have
grown
out
of
bogus
claims
spread
by
those
whose
only
agenda
is
to
kill
reform
at
any
cost
the
best
example
is
the
claim
made
not
just
by
radio
and
cable
talk
show
hosts
but
by
prominent
politicians
that
we
plan
to
set
up
panels
of
bureaucrats
with
the
power
to
kill
off
senior
citizens
now
such
charge
would
be
laughable
if
it
were
so
cynical
and
irresponsible
it
is
lie
plain
and
simple
there
are
also
those
who
claim
that
our
reform
efforts
would
insure
illegal
immigrants
this
too
is
false
the
reforms
the
reforms
proposing
would
not
apply
to
those
who
are
here
illegally
you
lie
president
it
not
true
and
one
more
misunderstanding
want
to
clear
up
under
our
plan
no
federal
dollars
will
be
used
to
fund
abortions
and
federal
conscience
laws
will
remain
in
place
now
my
health
care
proposal
has
also
been
attacked
by
some
who
oppose
reform
as
government
takeover
of
the
entire
health
care
system
as
proof
critics
point
to
provision
in
our
plan
that
allows
the
uninsured
and
small
businesses
to
choose
publicly
sponsored
insurance
option
administered
by
the
government
just
like
or
so
let
me
set
the
record
straight
here
my
guiding
principle
is
and
always
has
been
that
consumers
do
better
when
there
is
choice
and
competition
that
how
the
market
works
unfortunately
in
states
percent
of
the
insurance
market
is
controlled
by
five
or
fewer
companies
in
alabama
almost
percent
is
controlled
by
just
one
company
and
without
competition
the
price
of
insurance
goes
up
and
quality
goes
down
and
it
makes
it
easier
for
insurance
companies
to
treat
their
customers
badly
by
the
healthiest
individuals
and
trying
to
drop
the
sickest
by
overcharging
small
businesses
who
have
no
leverage
and
by
jacking
up
rates
insurance
executives
do
do
this
because
they
bad
people
they
do
it
because
it
profitable
as
one
former
insurance
executive
testified
before
congress
insurance
companies
are
not
only
encouraged
to
find
reasons
to
drop
the
seriously
ill
they
are
rewarded
for
it
all
of
this
is
in
service
of
meeting
what
this
former
executive
called
wall
street
relentless
profit
expectations
now
have
no
interest
in
putting
insurance
companies
out
of
business
they
provide
legitimate
service
and
employ
lot
of
our
friends
and
just
want
to
hold
them
accountable
and
the
insurance
reforms
that
already
mentioned
would
do
just
that
but
an
additional
step
we
can
take
to
keep
insurance
companies
honest
is
by
making
public
option
available
in
the
insurance
exchange
now
let
me
be
clear
let
me
be
clear
it
would
only
be
an
option
for
those
who
do
have
insurance
no
one
would
be
forced
to
choose
it
and
it
would
not
impact
those
of
you
who
already
have
insurance
in
fact
based
on
congressional
budget
office
estimates
we
believe
that
less
than
percent
of
americans
would
sign
up
despite
all
this
the
insurance
companies
and
their
allies
do
like
this
idea
they
argue
that
these
private
companies
fairly
compete
with
the
government
and
they
be
right
if
taxpayers
were
this
public
insurance
option
but
they
be
insisted
that
like
any
private
insurance
company
the
public
insurance
option
would
have
to
be
and
rely
on
the
premiums
it
collects
but
by
avoiding
some
of
the
overhead
that
gets
eaten
up
at
private
companies
by
profits
and
excessive
administrative
costs
and
executive
salaries
it
could
provide
good
deal
for
consumers
and
would
also
keep
pressure
on
private
insurers
to
keep
their
policies
affordable
and
treat
their
customers
better
the
same
way
public
colleges
and
universities
provide
additional
choice
and
competition
to
students
without
in
any
way
inhibiting
vibrant
system
of
private
colleges
and
universities
now
it
is
it
worth
noting
that
strong
majority
of
americans
still
public
insurance
option
of
the
sort
proposed
tonight
but
its
impact
should
be
exaggerated
by
the
left
or
the
right
or
the
media
it
is
only
one
part
of
my
plan
and
should
be
used
as
handy
excuse
for
the
usual
washington
ideological
battles
to
my
progressive
friends
would
remind
you
that
for
decades
the
driving
idea
behind
reform
has
been
to
end
insurance
company
abuses
and
make
coverage
available
for
those
without
it
the
public
option
the
public
option
is
only
means
to
that
end
and
we
should
remain
open
to
other
ideas
that
accomplish
our
ultimate
goal
and
to
my
republican
friends
say
that
rather
than
making
wild
claims
about
government
takeover
of
health
care
we
should
work
together
to
address
any
legitimate
concerns
you
may
have
for
example
for
example
some
have
suggested
that
the
public
option
go
into
effect
only
in
those
markets
where
insurance
companies
are
not
providing
affordable
policies
others
have
proposed
or
another
entity
to
administer
the
plan
these
are
all
constructive
ideas
worth
exploring
but
will
not
back
down
on
the
basic
principle
that
if
americans
find
affordable
coverage
we
will
provide
you
with
choice
and
will
make
sure
that
no
government
bureaucrat
or
insurance
company
bureaucrat
gets
between
you
and
the
care
that
you
need
finally
let
me
discuss
an
issue
that
is
great
concern
to
me
to
members
of
this
chamber
and
to
the
public
and
that
how
we
pay
for
this
plan
and
here
what
you
need
to
know
first
will
not
sign
plan
that
adds
one
dime
to
our
deficits
either
now
or
in
the
future
will
not
sign
it
if
it
adds
one
dime
to
the
deficit
now
or
in
the
future
period
and
to
prove
that
serious
there
will
be
provision
in
this
plan
that
requires
us
to
come
forward
with
more
spending
cuts
if
the
savings
we
promised
do
now
part
of
the
reason
faced
deficit
when
walked
in
the
door
of
the
white
house
is
because
too
many
initiatives
over
the
last
decade
were
not
paid
for
from
the
iraq
war
to
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthy
will
not
make
that
same
mistake
with
health
care
second
we
estimated
that
most
of
this
plan
can
be
paid
for
by
finding
savings
within
the
existing
health
care
system
system
that
is
currently
full
of
waste
and
abuse
right
now
too
much
of
the
savings
and
tax
dollars
we
spend
on
health
care
do
make
us
any
healthier
that
not
my
judgment
it
the
judgment
of
medical
professionals
across
this
country
and
this
is
also
true
when
it
comes
to
and
in
fact
want
to
speak
directly
to
seniors
for
moment
because
is
another
issue
that
been
subjected
to
demagoguery
and
distortion
during
the
course
of
this
debate
more
than
four
decades
ago
this
nation
stood
up
for
the
principle
that
after
lifetime
of
hard
work
our
seniors
should
not
be
left
to
struggle
with
pile
of
medical
bills
in
their
later
years
that
how
was
born
and
it
remains
sacred
trust
that
must
be
passed
down
from
one
generation
to
the
next
and
that
is
why
not
dollar
of
the
trust
fund
will
be
used
to
pay
for
this
plan
the
only
thing
this
plan
would
eliminate
is
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
waste
and
fraud
as
well
as
unwarranted
subsidies
in
that
go
to
insurance
companies
subsidies
that
do
everything
to
pad
their
profits
but
do
improve
the
care
of
seniors
and
we
will
also
create
an
independent
commission
of
doctors
and
medical
experts
charged
with
identifying
more
waste
in
the
years
ahead
now
these
steps
will
ensure
that
you
america
seniors
get
the
benefits
you
been
promised
they
will
ensure
that
is
there
for
future
generations
and
we
can
use
some
of
the
savings
to
fill
the
gap
in
coverage
that
forces
too
many
seniors
to
pay
thousands
of
dollars
year
out
of
their
own
pockets
for
prescription
drugs
that
what
this
plan
will
do
for
you
so
do
pay
attention
to
those
scary
stories
about
how
your
benefits
will
be
cut
especially
since
some
of
the
same
folks
who
are
spreading
these
tall
tales
have
fought
against
in
the
past
and
just
this
year
supported
budget
that
would
essentially
have
turned
into
voucher
program
that
will
not
happen
on
my
watch
will
protect
now
because
is
such
big
part
of
the
health
care
system
making
the
program
more
efficient
can
help
usher
in
changes
in
the
way
we
deliver
health
care
that
can
reduce
costs
for
everybody
we
have
long
known
that
some
places
like
the
in
utah
or
the
health
system
in
rural
offer
care
at
costs
below
average
so
the
commission
can
help
encourage
the
adoption
of
these
best
practices
by
doctors
and
medical
professionals
throughout
the
system
everything
from
reducing
hospital
infection
rates
to
encouraging
better
coordination
between
teams
of
doctors
reducing
the
waste
and
inefficiency
in
and
will
pay
for
most
of
this
plan
now
much
of
the
rest
would
be
paid
for
with
revenues
from
the
very
same
drug
and
insurance
companies
that
stand
to
benefit
from
tens
of
millions
of
new
customers
and
this
reform
will
charge
insurance
companies
fee
for
their
most
expensive
policies
which
will
encourage
them
to
provide
greater
value
for
the
money
an
idea
which
has
the
support
of
democratic
and
republican
experts
and
according
to
these
same
experts
this
modest
change
could
help
hold
down
the
cost
of
health
care
for
all
of
us
in
the
long
run
now
finally
many
in
this
chamber
particularly
on
the
republican
side
of
the
aisle
have
long
insisted
that
reforming
our
medical
malpractice
laws
can
help
bring
down
the
cost
of
health
care
now
there
you
go
there
you
go
now
do
believe
malpractice
reform
is
silver
bullet
but
talked
to
enough
doctors
to
know
that
defensive
medicine
may
be
contributing
to
unnecessary
proposing
that
we
move
forward
on
range
of
ideas
about
how
to
put
patient
safety
first
and
let
doctors
focus
on
medicine
know
that
the
bush
administration
considered
demonstration
projects
in
individual
states
to
test
these
ideas
think
it
good
idea
and
directing
my
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
to
move
forward
on
this
initiative
today
now
add
it
all
up
and
the
plan
proposing
will
cost
around
billion
over
years
less
than
we
have
spent
on
the
iraq
and
wars
and
less
than
the
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthiest
few
americans
that
congress
passed
at
the
beginning
of
the
previous
administration
now
most
of
these
costs
will
be
paid
for
with
money
already
being
spent
but
spent
badly
in
the
existing
health
care
system
the
plan
will
not
add
to
our
deficit
the
middle
class
will
greater
security
not
higher
taxes
and
if
we
are
able
to
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
costs
by
just
of
percent
each
year
of
percent
it
will
actually
reduce
the
deficit
by
trillion
over
the
long
term
now
this
is
the
plan
proposing
it
plan
that
incorporates
ideas
from
many
of
the
people
in
this
room
tonight
democrats
and
republicans
and
will
continue
to
seek
common
ground
in
the
weeks
ahead
if
you
come
to
me
with
serious
set
of
proposals
will
be
there
to
listen
my
door
is
always
open
but
know
this
will
not
waste
time
with
those
who
have
made
the
calculation
that
it
better
politics
to
kill
this
plan
than
to
improve
it
stand
by
while
the
special
interests
use
the
same
old
tactics
to
keep
things
exactly
the
way
they
are
if
you
misrepresent
what
in
this
plan
we
will
call
you
out
and
will
not
and
will
not
accept
the
status
as
solution
not
this
time
not
now
everyone
in
this
room
knows
what
will
happen
if
we
do
nothing
our
deficit
will
grow
more
families
will
go
bankrupt
more
businesses
will
close
more
americans
will
lose
their
coverage
when
they
are
sick
and
need
it
the
most
and
more
will
die
as
result
we
know
these
things
to
be
true
that
is
why
we
can
not
fail
because
there
are
too
many
americans
counting
on
us
to
succeed
the
ones
who
suffer
silently
and
the
ones
who
shared
their
stories
with
us
at
town
halls
in
and
in
letters
received
one
of
those
letters
few
days
ago
it
was
from
our
beloved
friend
and
colleague
ted
kennedy
he
had
written
it
back
in
may
shortly
after
he
was
told
that
his
illness
was
terminal
he
asked
that
it
be
delivered
upon
his
death
in
it
he
spoke
about
what
happy
time
his
last
months
were
thanks
to
the
love
and
support
of
family
and
friends
his
wife
his
amazing
children
who
are
all
here
tonight
and
he
expressed
confidence
that
this
would
be
the
year
that
health
care
reform
that
great
unfinished
business
of
our
society
he
called
it
would
finally
pass
he
repeated
the
truth
that
health
care
is
decisive
for
our
future
prosperity
but
he
also
reminded
me
that
it
concerns
more
than
material
things
what
we
face
he
wrote
is
above
all
moral
issue
at
stake
are
not
just
the
details
of
policy
but
fundamental
principles
of
social
justice
and
the
character
of
our
country
thought
about
that
phrase
quite
bit
in
recent
days
the
character
of
our
country
one
of
the
unique
and
wonderful
things
about
america
has
always
been
our
our
rugged
individualism
our
fierce
of
freedom
and
our
healthy
of
government
and
figuring
out
the
appropriate
size
and
role
of
government
has
always
been
source
of
rigorous
and
yes
sometimes
angry
debate
that
our
history
for
some
of
ted
kennedy
critics
his
brand
of
liberalism
represented
an
affront
to
american
liberty
in
their
minds
his
passion
for
universal
health
care
was
nothing
more
than
passion
for
big
government
but
those
of
us
who
knew
teddy
and
worked
with
him
here
people
of
both
parties
know
that
what
drove
him
was
something
more
his
friend
hatch
he
knows
that
they
worked
together
to
provide
children
with
health
insurance
his
friend
john
knows
that
they
worked
together
on
patient
bill
of
rights
his
friend
chuck
knows
that
they
worked
together
to
provide
health
care
to
children
with
disabilities
on
issues
like
these
ted
kennedy
passion
was
born
not
of
some
rigid
ideology
but
of
his
own
experience
it
was
the
experience
of
having
two
children
stricken
with
cancer
he
never
forgot
the
sheer
terror
and
helplessness
that
any
parent
feels
when
child
is
badly
sick
and
he
was
able
to
imagine
what
it
must
be
like
for
those
without
insurance
what
it
would
be
like
to
have
to
say
to
wife
or
child
or
an
aging
parent
there
is
something
that
could
make
you
better
but
just
afford
it
that
that
concern
and
regard
for
the
plight
of
others
is
not
partisan
feeling
it
not
republican
or
democratic
feeling
it
too
is
part
of
the
american
character
our
ability
to
stand
in
other
people
shoes
recognition
that
we
are
all
in
this
together
and
when
fortune
turns
against
one
of
us
others
are
there
to
lend
helping
hand
belief
that
in
this
country
hard
work
and
responsibility
should
be
rewarded
by
some
measure
of
security
and
fair
play
and
an
acknowledgment
that
sometimes
government
has
to
step
in
to
help
deliver
on
that
promise
this
has
always
been
the
history
of
our
progress
in
when
over
half
of
our
seniors
could
not
support
themselves
and
millions
had
seen
their
savings
wiped
away
there
were
those
who
argued
that
social
security
would
lead
to
socialism
but
the
men
and
women
of
congress
stood
fast
and
we
are
all
the
better
for
it
in
when
some
argued
that
represented
government
takeover
of
health
care
members
of
congress
democrats
and
republicans
did
not
back
down
they
joined
together
so
that
all
of
us
could
enter
our
golden
years
with
some
basic
peace
of
mind
you
see
our
predecessors
understood
that
government
could
not
and
should
not
solve
every
problem
they
understood
that
there
are
instances
when
the
gains
in
security
from
government
action
are
not
worth
the
added
constraints
on
our
freedom
but
they
also
understood
that
the
danger
of
too
much
government
is
matched
by
the
perils
of
too
little
that
without
the
leavening
hand
of
wise
policy
markets
can
crash
monopolies
can
stifle
competition
the
vulnerable
can
be
exploited
and
they
knew
that
when
any
government
measure
no
matter
how
carefully
crafted
or
beneficial
is
subject
to
scorn
when
any
efforts
to
help
people
in
need
are
attacked
as
when
facts
and
reason
are
thrown
overboard
and
only
timidity
passes
for
wisdom
and
we
can
no
longer
even
engage
in
civil
conversation
with
each
other
over
the
things
that
truly
matter
that
at
that
point
we
do
merely
lose
our
capacity
to
solve
big
challenges
we
lose
something
essential
about
ourselves
that
was
true
then
it
remains
true
today
understand
how
difficult
this
health
care
debate
has
been
know
that
many
in
this
country
are
deeply
that
government
is
looking
out
for
them
understand
that
the
politically
safe
move
would
be
to
kick
the
can
further
down
the
road
to
defer
reform
one
more
year
or
one
more
election
or
one
more
term
but
that
is
not
what
the
moment
calls
for
that
not
what
we
came
here
to
do
we
did
not
come
to
fear
the
future
we
came
here
to
shape
it
still
believe
we
can
act
even
when
it
hard
still
believe
still
believe
that
we
can
act
when
it
hard
still
believe
we
can
replace
acrimony
with
civility
and
gridlock
with
progress
still
believe
we
can
do
great
things
and
that
here
and
now
we
will
meet
history
test
because
that
who
we
are
that
is
our
calling
that
is
our
character
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
president
spar
trustees
president
hello
class
of
congratulations
on
reaching
this
day
thank
you
for
the
of
being
able
to
be
part
of
it
there
are
so
many
people
who
are
proud
of
you
your
parents
family
faculty
friends
all
who
share
in
this
achievement
so
please
give
them
big
round
of
applause
to
all
the
moms
who
are
here
today
you
could
not
ask
for
better
day
gift
than
to
see
all
of
these
folks
graduate
have
to
say
though
whenever
come
to
these
things
start
thinking
about
and
graduating
and
start
tearing
up
and
it
terrible
do
know
how
you
guys
are
holding
it
together
will
begin
by
telling
hard
truth
college
graduate
know
there
can
be
little
bit
of
sibling
rivalry
here
but
nevertheless
to
be
your
commencement
speaker
today
although
got
to
say
you
set
pretty
high
bar
given
the
past
three
years
these
are
not
easy
acts
to
follow
but
will
point
out
is
doing
an
extraordinary
job
as
one
of
the
finest
secretaries
of
state
america
has
ever
had
we
gave
the
presidential
medal
of
arts
and
humanities
is
not
just
good
friend
also
one
of
our
economic
advisers
so
like
the
old
saying
goes
keep
your
friends
close
and
your
commencement
speakers
even
closer
there
wisdom
in
that
now
the
year
graduated
this
area
looks
familiar
the
year
graduated
was
the
first
year
women
were
admitted
to
sally
ride
was
the
first
american
woman
in
space
music
was
all
about
and
the
audience
member
do
it
the
president
no
no
today
we
had
the
not
some
of
the
streets
around
here
were
not
quite
so
inviting
times
square
was
not
family
destination
so
know
this
is
all
ancient
history
nothing
worse
than
commencement
speakers
droning
on
about
bygone
days
but
for
all
the
differences
the
class
of
actually
had
lot
in
common
with
all
of
you
for
we
too
were
heading
out
into
world
at
moment
when
our
country
was
still
recovering
from
particularly
severe
economic
recession
it
was
time
of
change
it
was
time
of
uncertainty
it
was
time
of
passionate
political
debates
you
can
relate
to
this
because
just
as
you
were
starting
out
finding
your
way
around
this
campus
an
economic
crisis
struck
that
would
claim
more
than
million
jobs
before
the
end
of
your
freshman
year
since
then
some
of
you
have
probably
seen
parents
put
off
retirement
friends
struggle
to
find
work
and
you
may
be
looking
toward
the
future
with
that
same
sense
of
concern
that
my
generation
did
when
we
were
sitting
where
you
are
now
of
course
as
young
women
also
going
to
grapple
with
some
unique
challenges
like
whether
be
able
to
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
whether
be
able
to
balance
the
demands
of
your
job
and
your
family
whether
be
able
to
fully
control
decisions
about
your
own
health
and
while
opportunities
for
women
have
grown
exponentially
over
the
last
years
as
young
people
in
many
ways
you
have
it
even
tougher
than
we
did
this
recession
has
been
more
brutal
the
job
losses
steeper
politics
seems
nastier
congress
more
than
ever
some
folks
in
the
financial
world
have
not
exactly
been
model
corporate
citizens
no
wonder
that
faith
in
our
institutions
has
never
been
lower
particularly
when
good
news
get
the
same
kind
of
ratings
as
bad
news
anymore
every
day
you
receive
steady
stream
of
sensationalism
and
scandal
and
stories
with
message
that
suggest
change
possible
that
you
make
difference
that
you
be
able
to
close
that
gap
between
life
as
it
is
and
life
as
you
want
it
to
be
my
job
today
is
to
tell
you
believe
it
because
as
tough
as
things
have
been
am
convinced
you
are
tougher
seen
your
passion
and
seen
your
service
seen
you
engage
and
seen
you
turn
out
in
record
numbers
heard
your
voices
amplified
by
creativity
and
digital
fluency
that
those
of
us
in
older
generations
can
barely
comprehend
seen
generation
eager
impatient
even
to
step
into
the
rushing
waters
of
history
and
change
its
course
and
that
defiant
spirit
is
what
runs
through
the
veins
of
american
history
the
lifeblood
of
all
our
progress
and
it
is
that
spirit
which
we
need
your
generation
to
embrace
and
rekindle
right
now
see
the
question
is
not
whether
things
will
get
better
they
always
do
the
question
is
not
whether
got
the
solutions
to
our
challenges
had
them
within
our
grasp
for
quite
some
time
we
know
for
example
that
this
country
would
be
better
off
if
more
americans
were
able
to
get
the
kind
of
education
that
received
here
at
if
more
people
could
get
the
specific
skills
and
training
that
employers
are
looking
for
today
we
know
that
all
be
better
off
if
we
invest
in
science
and
technology
that
sparks
new
businesses
and
medical
breakthroughs
if
we
developed
more
clean
energy
so
we
could
use
less
foreign
oil
and
reduce
the
carbon
pollution
threatening
our
planet
we
know
that
better
off
when
there
are
rules
that
stop
big
banks
from
making
bad
bets
with
other
money
and
when
insurance
companies
allowed
to
drop
your
coverage
when
you
need
it
most
or
charge
women
differently
from
men
indeed
we
know
we
are
better
off
when
women
are
treated
fairly
and
equally
in
every
aspect
of
american
life
whether
the
salary
you
earn
or
the
health
decisions
you
make
we
know
these
things
to
be
true
we
know
that
our
challenges
are
eminently
solvable
the
question
is
whether
together
we
can
muster
the
will
in
our
own
lives
in
our
common
institutions
in
our
politics
to
bring
about
the
changes
we
need
and
convinced
your
generation
possesses
that
will
and
believe
that
the
women
of
this
generation
that
all
of
you
will
help
lead
the
way
now
cheap
applause
line
when
you
giving
commencement
at
the
easy
thing
to
say
but
true
it
is
in
part
it
is
simple
math
today
women
are
not
just
half
this
country
half
its
workforce
more
and
more
women
are
their
husbands
more
than
half
of
our
college
graduates
and
graduates
and
so
got
us
outnumbered
after
decades
of
slow
steady
extraordinary
progress
you
are
now
poised
to
make
this
the
century
where
women
shape
not
only
their
own
destiny
but
the
destiny
of
this
nation
and
of
this
world
but
how
far
your
leadership
takes
this
country
how
far
it
takes
this
world
well
that
will
be
up
to
you
got
to
want
it
it
will
not
be
handed
to
you
and
as
someone
who
wants
that
future
that
better
future
for
you
and
for
and
as
somebody
had
the
good
fortune
of
being
the
husband
and
the
father
and
the
son
of
some
strong
remarkable
women
allow
me
to
offer
just
few
pieces
of
advice
that
obligatory
bear
with
me
my
first
piece
of
advice
is
this
just
get
involved
fight
for
your
seat
at
the
table
better
yet
fight
for
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
been
said
that
the
most
important
role
in
our
democracy
is
the
role
of
citizen
and
indeed
it
was
years
ago
today
that
the
constitutional
convention
opened
in
and
our
founders
citizens
all
began
crafting
an
extraordinary
document
yes
it
had
its
flaws
flaws
that
this
nation
has
strived
to
protect
perfect
over
time
questions
of
race
and
gender
were
unresolved
no
signature
graced
the
original
document
although
we
can
assume
that
there
were
founding
mothers
whispering
smarter
things
in
the
ears
of
the
founding
fathers
mean
that
almost
certain
what
made
this
document
special
was
that
it
provided
the
space
the
possibility
for
those
who
had
been
left
out
of
our
charter
to
fight
their
way
in
it
provided
people
the
language
to
appeal
to
principles
and
ideals
that
broadened
reach
it
allowed
for
protest
and
movements
and
the
dissemination
of
new
ideas
that
would
repeatedly
decade
after
decade
change
the
world
constant
forward
movement
that
continues
to
this
day
our
founders
understood
that
america
does
not
stand
still
we
are
dynamic
not
static
we
look
forward
not
back
and
now
that
new
doors
have
been
opened
for
you
got
an
obligation
to
seize
those
opportunities
you
need
to
do
this
not
just
for
yourself
but
for
those
who
yet
enjoy
the
choices
that
had
the
choices
you
will
have
and
one
reason
many
workplaces
still
have
outdated
policies
is
because
women
only
account
for
percent
of
the
at
fortune
companies
one
reason
actually
battles
over
rights
is
because
women
occupy
fewer
than
one
in
five
seats
in
congress
now
not
saying
that
the
only
way
to
achieve
success
is
by
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
corporate
ladder
or
running
for
office
although
face
it
congress
would
get
lot
more
done
if
you
did
that
think
sure
about
but
if
you
decide
not
to
sit
yourself
at
the
table
at
the
very
least
got
to
make
sure
you
have
say
in
who
does
it
matters
before
women
like
and
olympia
and
others
got
to
congress
just
to
take
one
example
much
of
research
on
diseases
focused
solely
on
their
effects
on
men
it
until
women
like
mink
and
green
got
to
congress
and
passed
title
years
ago
this
year
that
we
declared
women
too
should
be
allowed
to
compete
and
win
on
playing
fields
until
woman
named
showed
up
at
her
office
and
had
the
courage
to
step
up
and
say
you
know
what
this
right
women
being
treated
fairly
we
lacked
some
of
the
tools
we
needed
to
uphold
the
basic
principle
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work
so
accept
somebody
construction
of
the
way
things
ought
to
be
up
to
you
to
right
wrongs
up
to
you
to
point
out
injustice
up
to
you
to
hold
the
system
accountable
and
sometimes
it
entirely
up
to
you
to
stand
up
and
to
be
heard
to
write
and
to
lobby
to
march
to
to
vote
be
content
to
just
sit
back
and
watch
those
who
oppose
change
those
who
benefit
from
an
unjust
status
have
always
bet
on
the
cynicism
or
the
public
complacency
throughout
american
history
though
they
have
lost
that
bet
and
believe
they
will
this
time
as
well
but
ultimately
class
of
that
will
depend
on
you
wait
for
the
person
next
to
you
to
be
the
first
to
speak
up
for
right
because
maybe
just
maybe
waiting
on
you
which
brings
me
to
my
second
piece
of
advice
never
underestimate
the
power
of
your
example
the
very
fact
that
you
are
graduating
let
alone
that
more
women
now
graduate
from
college
than
men
is
only
possible
because
earlier
generations
of
women
your
mothers
your
grandmothers
your
aunts
shattered
the
myth
that
you
or
be
where
you
are
think
of
friend
of
mine
the
daughter
of
immigrants
when
she
was
in
high
school
her
guidance
told
her
you
know
what
just
not
college
material
you
should
think
about
becoming
secretary
well
she
was
stubborn
so
she
went
to
college
anyway
she
got
her
she
ran
for
local
office
won
she
ran
for
state
office
she
won
she
ran
for
congress
she
won
and
and
behold
did
end
up
becoming
secretary
she
is
secretary
of
so
think
about
what
that
means
to
young
girl
when
she
sees
cabinet
secretary
that
looks
like
her
think
about
what
it
means
to
young
girl
in
when
she
sees
presidential
candidate
who
looks
like
her
think
about
what
it
means
to
young
girl
walking
in
right
down
the
street
when
she
sees
ambassador
who
looks
like
her
do
not
underestimate
the
power
of
your
example
this
diploma
opens
up
new
possibilities
so
reach
back
convince
young
girl
to
earn
one
too
if
you
earned
your
degree
in
areas
where
we
need
more
women
like
computer
science
or
engineering
reach
back
and
persuade
another
student
to
study
it
too
if
you
going
into
fields
where
we
need
more
women
like
construction
or
computer
engineering
reach
back
hire
someone
new
be
mentor
be
role
model
until
girl
can
imagine
herself
can
picture
herself
as
computer
programmer
or
combatant
commander
she
become
one
until
there
are
women
who
tell
her
ignore
our
pop
culture
obsession
over
beauty
and
fashion
and
focus
instead
on
studying
and
inventing
and
competing
and
leading
think
those
are
the
only
things
that
girls
are
supposed
to
care
about
now
will
say
nothing
wrong
with
caring
about
it
little
bit
you
can
be
stylish
and
powerful
too
that
advice
and
never
forget
that
the
most
important
example
young
girl
will
ever
follow
is
that
of
parent
and
are
going
to
be
outstanding
women
because
and
are
outstanding
women
so
understand
your
power
and
use
it
wisely
my
last
piece
of
advice
this
is
simple
but
perhaps
most
important
persevere
persevere
nothing
worthwhile
is
easy
no
one
of
achievement
has
avoided
failure
sometimes
catastrophic
failures
but
they
keep
at
it
they
learn
from
mistakes
they
quit
you
know
when
first
arrived
on
this
campus
it
was
with
little
money
fewer
options
but
it
was
here
that
tried
to
find
my
place
in
this
world
knew
wanted
to
make
difference
but
it
was
vague
how
in
fact
go
about
it
but
wanted
to
do
my
part
to
do
my
part
to
shape
better
world
so
even
as
worked
after
graduation
in
few
jobs
here
in
new
york
will
not
list
them
all
even
as
went
from
motley
apartment
to
motley
apartment
reached
out
started
to
write
letters
to
community
all
across
the
country
and
one
day
small
group
of
churches
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
answered
offering
me
work
with
people
in
hit
hard
by
steel
mills
that
were
shutting
down
and
communities
where
jobs
were
dying
away
the
community
had
been
plagued
by
gang
violence
so
once
arrived
one
of
the
first
things
we
tried
to
do
was
to
meeting
with
community
leaders
to
deal
with
gangs
and
worked
for
weeks
on
this
project
we
invited
the
police
we
made
phone
calls
we
went
to
churches
we
passed
out
flyers
the
night
of
the
meeting
we
arranged
rows
and
rows
of
chairs
in
anticipation
of
this
crowd
and
we
waited
and
we
waited
and
finally
group
of
older
folks
walked
in
to
the
hall
and
they
sat
down
and
this
little
old
lady
raised
her
hand
and
asked
this
where
the
bingo
game
is
it
was
disaster
nobody
showed
up
my
first
big
community
meeting
nobody
showed
up
and
later
the
volunteers
worked
with
told
me
that
it
quitting
they
been
doing
this
for
two
years
even
before
had
arrived
they
had
nothing
to
show
for
it
and
be
honest
felt
pretty
discouraged
as
well
did
know
what
was
doing
thought
about
quitting
and
as
we
were
talking
looked
outside
and
saw
some
young
boys
playing
in
vacant
lot
across
the
street
and
they
were
just
throwing
rocks
up
at
boarded
building
they
had
nothing
better
to
do
late
at
night
just
throwing
rocks
and
said
to
the
volunteers
you
quit
answer
one
question
what
will
happen
to
those
boys
if
you
quit
who
will
fight
for
them
if
we
who
will
give
them
fair
shot
if
we
leave
and
one
by
one
the
volunteers
decided
not
to
quit
we
went
back
to
those
and
we
kept
at
it
we
registered
new
voters
and
we
set
up
programs
and
we
fought
for
new
jobs
and
helped
people
live
lives
with
some
measure
of
dignity
and
we
sustained
ourselves
with
those
small
victories
we
set
the
world
on
fire
some
of
those
communities
are
still
very
poor
there
are
still
lot
of
gangs
out
there
but
believe
that
it
was
those
small
victories
that
helped
me
win
the
bigger
victories
of
my
last
three
and
half
years
as
president
and
wish
could
say
that
this
perseverance
came
from
some
innate
toughness
in
me
but
the
truth
is
it
was
learned
got
it
from
watching
the
people
who
raised
me
more
specifically
got
it
from
watching
the
women
who
shaped
my
life
grew
up
as
the
son
of
single
mom
who
struggled
to
put
herself
through
school
and
make
ends
meet
she
had
marriages
that
fell
apart
even
went
on
food
stamps
at
one
point
to
help
us
get
by
but
she
quit
and
she
earned
her
degree
and
made
sure
that
through
scholarships
and
hard
work
my
sister
and
earned
ours
she
used
to
wake
me
up
when
we
were
living
overseas
wake
me
up
before
dawn
to
study
my
english
lessons
and
when
complain
just
look
at
me
and
say
is
no
picnic
for
me
either
and
my
mom
ended
up
dedicating
herself
to
helping
women
around
the
world
access
the
money
they
needed
to
start
their
own
businesses
she
was
an
early
pioneer
in
and
that
meant
though
that
she
was
gone
lot
and
she
had
her
own
struggles
trying
to
figure
out
balancing
motherhood
and
career
and
when
she
was
gone
my
grandmother
stepped
up
to
take
care
of
me
she
only
had
high
school
education
she
got
job
at
local
bank
she
hit
the
glass
ceiling
and
watched
men
she
once
trained
promoted
up
the
ladder
ahead
of
her
but
she
quit
rather
than
grow
hard
or
angry
each
time
she
got
passed
over
she
kept
doing
her
job
as
best
as
she
knew
how
and
ultimately
ended
up
being
vice
president
at
the
bank
she
quit
and
later
on
met
woman
who
was
assigned
to
advise
me
on
my
first
summer
job
at
law
firm
and
she
gave
me
such
good
advice
that
married
her
and
and
gave
everything
we
had
to
balance
our
careers
and
young
family
but
face
it
no
matter
how
enlightened
must
have
thought
myself
to
be
it
often
fell
more
on
her
shoulders
when
was
when
was
away
know
that
when
she
was
with
our
girls
feel
guilty
that
she
giving
enough
time
to
her
work
and
when
she
was
at
her
work
feel
guilty
she
giving
enough
time
to
our
girls
and
both
of
us
wished
we
had
some
superpower
that
would
let
us
be
in
two
places
at
once
but
we
persisted
we
made
that
marriage
work
and
the
reason
had
the
strength
to
juggle
everything
and
put
up
with
me
and
eventually
the
public
spotlight
was
because
she
too
came
from
family
of
folks
who
quit
because
she
saw
her
dad
get
up
and
go
to
work
every
day
even
though
he
never
finished
college
even
though
he
had
crippling
she
saw
her
mother
even
though
she
never
finished
college
in
that
school
that
urban
school
every
day
making
sure
and
her
brother
were
getting
the
education
they
deserved
saw
how
her
parents
never
quit
they
never
indulged
in
no
matter
how
stacked
the
odds
were
against
them
they
did
quit
those
are
the
folks
who
inspire
me
people
ask
me
sometimes
who
inspires
you
president
those
quiet
all
across
this
country
some
of
your
parents
and
grandparents
who
are
sitting
here
no
fanfare
no
articles
written
about
them
they
just
persevere
they
just
do
their
jobs
they
meet
their
responsibilities
they
do
quit
only
here
because
of
them
they
may
not
have
set
out
to
change
the
world
but
in
small
important
ways
they
did
they
certainly
changed
mine
so
whether
starting
business
or
running
for
office
or
raising
amazing
family
remember
that
making
your
mark
on
the
world
is
hard
it
takes
patience
it
takes
commitment
it
comes
with
plenty
of
setbacks
and
it
comes
with
plenty
of
failures
but
whenever
you
feel
that
creeping
cynicism
whenever
you
hear
those
voices
say
you
make
difference
whenever
somebody
tells
you
to
set
your
sights
lower
the
trajectory
of
this
country
should
give
you
hope
previous
generations
should
give
you
hope
what
young
generations
have
done
before
should
give
you
hope
young
folks
who
marched
and
and
stood
up
and
sat
in
from
falls
to
to
just
do
it
for
themselves
they
did
it
for
other
people
how
we
achieved
rights
that
how
we
achieved
voting
rights
that
how
we
achieved
rights
that
how
we
achieved
gay
rights
how
made
this
union
more
perfect
and
if
willing
to
do
your
part
now
if
you
willing
to
reach
up
and
close
that
gap
between
what
america
is
and
what
america
should
be
want
you
to
know
that
will
be
right
there
with
you
if
you
are
ready
to
fight
for
that
brilliant
radically
simple
idea
of
america
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
what
you
look
like
no
matter
who
you
love
or
what
god
you
worship
you
can
still
pursue
your
own
happiness
will
join
you
every
step
of
the
way
now
more
than
ever
now
more
than
ever
america
needs
what
you
the
class
of
has
to
offer
america
needs
you
to
reach
high
and
hope
deeply
and
if
you
fight
for
your
seat
at
the
table
and
you
set
better
example
and
you
persevere
in
what
you
decide
to
do
with
your
life
have
every
faith
not
only
that
you
will
succeed
but
that
through
you
our
nation
will
continue
to
be
beacon
of
light
for
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
in
every
corner
of
the
globe
so
thank
you
congratulations
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america

fellow

gather
during
historic
anniversary
last
year

very
weekend

finally
delivered
justice

one
of
the
most
notorious
individuals
photo
of
trump

this
year
we
gather
in
the
midst
of
heated
election
season
and
tells
me
should
never
miss
chance
to
reintroduce
myself
to
the
american
people
so
tonight
this
is
how
like
to
begin
my
name
is
my
mother
was
born
in
my
father
was
born
in
kenya
and
was
born
of
course
in
hawaii
in
took
office
in
the
face
of
some
enormous
challenges
now
some
have
said
blame
too
many
problems
on
my
predecessor
but
not
forget
practice
that
was
initiated
by
george
bush
since
then
congress
and
have
certainly
had
our
differences
yet
tried
to
be
civil
to
not
take
any
cheap
shots
and
why
want
to
especially
thank
all
the
members
who
took
break
from
their
exhausting
schedule
of
not
passing
any
laws
to
be
here
tonight
give
them
big
round
of
applause
despite
many
obstacles
much
has
changed
during
my
time
in
office
four
years
ago
was
locked
in
brutal
primary
battle
with
four
years
later
she
stop
me
from
four
years
ago
was
washington
outsider
four
years
later
at
this
dinner
four
years
ago
looked
like
this
today
look
like
this
and
four
years
from
now
will
look
like
this
not
even
funny
anyway
great
to
be
here
this
evening
in
the
vast
magnificent
ballroom
or
what
mitt
would
call
little
mean
look
at
this
party
got
men
in
women
in
gowns
fine
wine
entertainment
was
just
relieved
to
learn
this
was
not
conference
unbelievable
not
even
the
mind
reader
knew
what
they
were
thinking
of
course
the
white
house
dinner
is
known
as
the
of
washington
term
coined
by
political
reporters
who
clearly
never
had
the
chance
to
go
to
an
actual
our
chaperone
for
the
evening
is
jimmy
who
is
perfect
for
the
job
since
most
of
audience
is
in
his
key
demographic
people
who
fall
asleep
during
jimmy
got
his
start
years
ago
on
the
man
show
in
washington
what
we
call
congressional
hearing
on
contraception
and
plenty
of
journalists
are
here
tonight
be
remiss
if
congratulate
the
post
on
their
prize
you
deserve
it
there
no
one
else
out
there
linking
to
the
kinds
of
journalism
that
is
linking
to
every
single
day
give
them
round
of
applause
and
you
pay
them
it
great
business
model
even
is
getting
back
into
the
game
guest
hosting
on
the
today
show
which
reminds
me
of
an
old
saying
what
the
difference
between
hockey
mom
and
pit
bull
pit
bull
is
delicious
little
soy
sauce
now
know
at
this
point
many
of
you
are
expecting
me
to
go
after
my
likely
opponent
newt
newt
there
still
time
man
but
not
going
to
do
that
not
going
to
attack
any
of
the
republican
candidates
take
mitt
he
and
actually
have
lot
in
common
we
both
think
of
our
wives
as
our
better
halves
and
polls
show
to
alarmingly
insulting
extent
the
american
people
agree
we
also
both
have
degrees
from
harvard
have
one
he
has
two
what
snob
of
course
we
also
had
our
differences
recently
his
campaign
me
for
slow
jamming
the
news
with
jimmy
in
fact
understand
governor
was
so
incensed
he
asked
his
staff
if
he
could
get
some
equal
time
on
the
griffin
show
still
guess
governor
is
feeling
pretty
good
about
things
because
he
took
few
hours
off
the
other
day
to
see
the
hunger
games
some
of
you
have
seen
it
it
movie
about
people
who
court
wealthy
sponsors
and
then
brutally
savage
each
other
until
only
one
contestant
is
left
standing
sure
this
was
really
good
change
of
pace
for
him
have
not
seen
the
hunger
games
not
enough
class
warfare
for
me
of
course
know
everybody
is
predicting
nasty
election
and
thankfully
we
all
agreed
that
families
are
off
limits
dogs
however
are
apparently
fair
game
and
while
both
campaigns
have
had
some
fun
with
this
the
other
day
saw
new
from
one
of
these
outside
groups
that
frankly
think
crossed
the
line
know
governor
says
he
has
no
control
over
what
his
super
do
but
can
we
show
the
real
quick
pretty
rough
but
can
take
it
because
my
stepfather
always
told
me
it
world
out
there
now
if
do
win
second
term
as
president
let
me
just
say
something
to
all
the
let
me
just
say
something
to
all
my
friends
on
the
right
who
think
planning
to
unleash
some
secret
agenda
you
absolutely
right
so
allow
me
to
close
with
quick
preview
of
the
secret
agenda
you
can
expect
in
second
administration
in
my
first
term
sang
green
in
my
second
term
going
with
young
yeah
the
president
said
yeah
sing
that
to
her
sometimes
in
my
first
term
we
ended
the
war
in
iraq
in
my
second
term
will
win
the
war
on
in
my
first
term
we
repealed
the
policy
known
as
do
ask
do
tell
wait
though
in
my
second
term
we
will
replace
it
with
policy
known
as
it
raining
men
in
my
first
term
we
passed
health
care
reform
in
my
second
term
guess
pass
it
again
do
want
to
end
tonight
on
slightly
more
serious
note
whoever
takes
the
oath
of
office
next
january
will
face
some
great
challenges
but
he
will
also
inherit
traditions
that
make
us
greater
than
the
challenges
we
face
and
one
of
those
traditions
is
represented
here
tonight
free
press
that
is
afraid
to
ask
questions
to
examine
and
to
and
in
service
of
that
mission
all
of
you
make
sacrifices
tonight
we
remember
journalists
such
as
and
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
as
they
sought
to
shine
light
on
some
of
the
most
important
stories
of
our
time
so
whether
you
are
or
broadcaster
whether
you
take
on
powerful
interests
here
at
home
or
put
yourself
in
harm
way
overseas
have
the
greatest
respect
and
admiration
for
what
you
do
know
sometimes
you
like
to
give
me
hard
time
and
certainly
like
to
return
the
but
never
forget
that
our
country
depends
on
you
you
help
protect
our
freedom
our
democracy
and
our
way
of
life
and
just
to
set
the
record
straight
really
do
enjoy
attending
these
dinners
in
fact
had
lot
more
material
prepared
but
have
to
get
the
secret
service
home
in
time
for
their
new
curfew
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
the
president
well
good
afternoon
and
and
thank
you
to
dean
and
the
board
of
the
associated
press
for
inviting
me
here
today
it
is
pleasure
to
speak
to
all
of
you
and
to
have
microphone
that
can
see
feel
free
to
transmit
any
of
this
to
if
you
see
him
clearly
already
in
the
beginning
months
of
another
long
lively
election
year
there
will
be
gaffes
and
minor
controversies
be
hot
and
moments
you
will
cover
every
word
that
we
say
and
we
will
complain
vociferously
about
the
unflattering
words
that
you
write
unless
of
course
you
writing
about
the
other
guy
in
which
case
good
job
but
there
are
also
big
fundamental
issues
at
stake
right
now
issues
that
deserve
serious
debate
among
every
candidate
and
serious
coverage
among
every
reporter
whoever
he
may
be
the
next
president
will
inherit
an
economy
that
is
recovering
but
not
yet
recovered
from
the
worst
economic
calamity
since
the
great
depression
too
many
americans
will
still
be
looking
for
job
that
pays
enough
to
cover
their
bills
or
their
mortgage
too
many
citizens
will
still
lack
the
sort
of
financial
security
that
started
slipping
away
years
before
this
recession
hit
debt
that
has
grown
over
the
last
decade
primarily
as
result
of
two
wars
two
massive
tax
cuts
and
an
unprecedented
financial
crisis
will
have
to
be
paid
down
in
the
face
of
all
these
challenges
we
going
to
have
to
answer
central
question
as
nation
what
if
anything
can
we
do
to
restore
sense
of
security
for
people
who
are
willing
to
work
hard
and
act
responsibly
in
this
country
can
we
succeed
as
country
where
shrinking
number
of
people
do
exceedingly
well
while
growing
number
struggle
to
get
by
or
are
we
better
off
when
everyone
gets
fair
shot
and
everyone
does
their
fair
share
and
everyone
plays
by
the
same
rules
this
is
not
just
another
political
debate
said
the
defining
issue
of
our
time
and
believe
it
why
ran
in
what
my
presidency
has
been
about
why
running
again
believe
this
is
moment
for
the
middle
class
and
remember
time
when
the
choice
between
competing
visions
of
our
future
has
been
so
unambiguously
clear
keep
in
mind
have
never
been
somebody
who
believes
that
government
can
or
should
try
to
solve
every
problem
some
of
you
know
my
first
job
in
chicago
was
working
with
group
of
catholic
churches
that
often
did
more
good
for
the
people
in
their
communities
than
any
government
program
could
in
those
same
communities
saw
that
no
education
policy
however
well
crafted
can
take
the
place
of
love
and
attention
as
president
eliminated
dozens
of
programs
that
working
and
announced
over
regulatory
reforms
that
will
save
businesses
and
taxpayers
billions
and
put
annual
domestic
spending
on
path
to
become
the
smallest
share
of
the
economy
since
held
this
office
since
before
was
born
know
that
the
true
engine
of
job
creation
in
this
country
is
the
private
sector
not
washington
which
is
why
cut
taxes
for
small
business
owners
times
over
the
last
three
years
so
believe
deeply
that
the
free
market
is
the
greatest
force
for
economic
progress
in
human
history
my
mother
and
the
grandparents
who
raised
me
instilled
the
values
of
and
personal
responsibility
that
remain
the
cornerstone
of
the
american
idea
but
also
share
the
belief
of
our
first
republican
president
abraham
lincoln
belief
that
through
government
we
should
do
together
what
we
can
not
do
as
well
for
ourselves
that
belief
is
the
reason
this
country
has
been
able
to
build
strong
military
to
keep
us
safe
and
public
schools
to
educate
our
children
that
belief
is
why
been
able
to
lay
down
and
highways
to
facilitate
travel
and
commerce
that
belief
is
why
been
able
to
support
the
work
of
scientists
and
researchers
whose
discoveries
have
saved
lives
and
unleashed
repeated
technological
revolutions
and
led
to
countless
new
jobs
and
entire
industries
that
belief
is
also
why
sought
to
ensure
that
every
citizen
can
count
on
some
basic
measure
of
security
we
do
this
because
we
that
no
matter
how
responsibly
we
live
our
lives
any
one
of
us
at
any
moment
might
face
hard
times
might
face
bad
luck
might
face
crippling
illness
or
layoff
and
so
we
contribute
to
programs
like
and
social
security
which
guarantee
health
care
and
source
of
income
after
lifetime
of
hard
work
we
provide
unemployment
insurance
which
protects
us
against
unexpected
job
loss
and
facilitates
the
mobility
that
makes
our
economy
so
dynamic
we
provide
for
which
makes
sure
that
millions
of
seniors
in
nursing
homes
and
children
with
disabilities
are
getting
the
care
that
they
need
for
generations
nearly
all
of
these
investments
from
transportation
to
education
to
retirement
programs
have
been
supported
by
people
in
both
parties
as
much
as
we
might
associate
the
bill
with
or
with
it
was
republican
lincoln
who
launched
the
transcontinental
railroad
the
national
academy
of
sciences
land
grant
colleges
it
was
who
launched
the
highway
system
and
new
investment
in
scientific
research
it
was
nixon
who
created
the
environmental
protection
agency
who
worked
with
democrats
to
save
social
security
it
was
george
bush
who
added
prescription
drug
coverage
to
what
leaders
in
both
parties
have
traditionally
understood
is
that
these
investments
part
of
some
scheme
to
redistribute
wealth
from
one
group
to
another
they
are
expressions
of
the
fact
that
we
are
one
nation
these
investments
benefit
us
all
they
contribute
to
genuine
durable
economic
growth
show
me
business
leader
who
profit
if
more
americans
could
afford
to
get
the
skills
and
education
that
jobs
require
ask
any
company
where
rather
locate
and
hire
workers
country
with
crumbling
roads
and
bridges
or
one
committed
to
internet
and
and
research
and
development
it
make
us
weaker
when
we
guarantee
basic
security
for
the
elderly
or
the
sick
or
those
who
are
actively
looking
for
work
what
makes
us
weaker
is
when
fewer
and
fewer
people
can
afford
to
buy
the
goods
and
services
our
businesses
sell
or
when
entrepreneurs
have
the
financial
security
to
take
chance
and
start
new
business
what
drags
down
our
entire
economy
is
when
an
chasm
between
the
and
everybody
else
in
this
country
prosperity
has
never
trickled
down
from
the
success
of
wealthy
few
it
has
always
come
from
the
success
of
strong
and
growing
middle
class
how
generation
who
went
to
college
on
the
bill
including
my
grandfather
helped
build
the
most
prosperous
economy
the
world
has
ever
known
why
like
henry
ford
made
it
his
mission
to
pay
his
workers
enough
so
they
could
buy
the
cars
that
they
made
why
research
has
shown
that
countries
with
less
inequality
tend
to
have
stronger
and
steadier
economic
growth
over
the
long
run
and
yet
for
much
of
the
last
century
we
have
been
having
the
same
argument
with
folks
who
keep
peddling
some
version
of
economics
they
keep
telling
us
that
if
convert
more
of
our
investments
in
education
and
research
and
health
care
into
tax
cuts
especially
for
the
wealthy
our
economy
will
grow
stronger
they
keep
telling
us
that
if
just
strip
away
more
regulations
and
let
businesses
pollute
more
and
treat
workers
and
consumers
with
impunity
that
somehow
all
be
better
off
told
that
when
the
wealthy
become
even
wealthier
and
corporations
are
allowed
to
their
profits
by
whatever
means
necessary
good
for
america
and
that
their
success
will
automatically
translate
into
more
jobs
and
prosperity
for
everybody
else
the
theory
now
the
problem
for
advocates
of
this
theory
is
that
tried
their
approach
on
massive
scale
the
results
of
their
experiment
are
there
for
all
to
see
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
decade
the
wealthiest
americans
received
huge
tax
cut
in
and
another
huge
tax
cut
in
we
were
promised
that
these
tax
cuts
would
lead
to
faster
job
growth
they
did
not
the
wealthy
got
wealthier
we
would
expect
that
the
income
of
the
top
percent
has
grown
by
more
than
percent
over
the
last
few
decades
to
an
average
of
million
year
but
prosperity
sure
did
trickle
down
instead
during
the
last
decade
we
had
the
slowest
job
growth
in
half
century
and
the
typical
american
family
actually
saw
their
incomes
fall
by
about
percent
even
as
the
economy
was
growing
it
was
period
when
insurance
companies
and
mortgage
lenders
and
financial
institutions
have
to
abide
by
strong
enough
regulations
or
they
found
their
ways
around
them
and
what
was
the
result
profits
for
many
of
these
companies
soared
but
so
did
health
insurance
premiums
patients
were
routinely
denied
care
often
when
they
needed
it
most
families
were
enticed
and
sometimes
just
plain
tricked
into
buying
homes
they
afford
huge
reckless
bets
were
made
with
other
money
on
the
line
and
our
entire
financial
system
was
nearly
destroyed
so
we
tried
this
theory
out
and
you
would
think
that
after
the
results
of
this
experiment
in
economics
after
the
results
were
made
painfully
clear
that
the
proponents
of
this
theory
might
show
some
humility
might
moderate
their
views
bit
you
think
say
you
know
what
maybe
some
rules
and
regulations
are
necessary
to
protect
the
economy
and
prevent
people
from
being
taken
advantage
of
by
insurance
companies
or
credit
card
companies
or
mortgage
lenders
maybe
just
maybe
at
time
of
growing
debt
and
widening
inequality
we
should
hold
off
on
giving
the
wealthiest
americans
another
round
of
big
tax
cuts
maybe
when
we
know
that
most
of
jobs
require
more
than
high
school
degree
we
gut
education
or
lay
off
thousands
of
teachers
or
raise
interest
rates
on
college
loans
or
take
away
financial
aid
but
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
done
instead
of
moderating
their
views
even
slightly
the
republicans
running
congress
right
now
have
doubled
down
and
proposed
budget
so
far
to
the
right
it
makes
the
contract
with
america
look
like
the
new
deal
in
fact
that
renowned
liberal
newt
first
called
the
original
version
of
the
budget
radical
and
said
it
would
contribute
to
social
engineering
this
is
coming
from
newt
and
yet
this
budget
supported
by
some
small
rump
group
in
the
republican
party
this
is
now
the
governing
platform
this
is
what
running
on
one
of
my
potential
opponents
governor
has
said
that
he
hoped
similar
version
of
this
plan
from
last
year
would
be
introduced
as
bill
on
day
one
of
his
presidency
he
said
that
of
this
new
budget
and
he
even
called
it
which
is
word
you
often
hear
when
it
comes
to
describing
budget
word
you
often
hear
generally
so
what
this
budget
does
back
in
the
summer
came
to
an
agreement
with
republicans
in
congress
to
cut
roughly
trillion
in
annual
spending
some
of
these
cuts
were
about
getting
rid
of
waste
others
were
about
programs
that
we
support
but
just
afford
given
our
deficits
and
our
debt
and
part
of
the
agreement
was
guarantee
of
another
trillion
in
savings
for
total
of
about
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
this
new
house
republican
budget
however
breaks
our
bipartisan
agreement
and
proposes
massive
new
cuts
in
annual
domestic
spending
exactly
the
area
where
already
cut
the
most
and
want
to
actually
go
through
what
it
would
mean
for
our
country
if
these
cuts
were
to
be
spread
out
evenly
so
bear
with
me
want
to
go
through
this
because
think
people
fully
appreciate
the
nature
of
this
budget
the
year
after
next
nearly
million
college
students
would
see
their
financial
aid
cut
by
an
average
of
more
than
each
there
would
be
fewer
medical
grants
research
grants
for
things
like
and
cancer
and
aids
there
would
be
fewer
scientific
research
grants
eliminating
support
for
researchers
students
and
teachers
investments
in
clean
energy
technologies
that
are
helping
us
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
would
be
cut
by
nearly
fifth
if
this
budget
becomes
law
and
the
cuts
were
applied
evenly
starting
in
over
children
would
lose
their
chance
to
get
an
early
education
in
the
head
start
program
two
million
mothers
and
young
children
would
be
cut
from
program
that
gives
them
access
to
healthy
food
there
would
be
fewer
federal
grants
at
the
department
of
justice
and
the
to
combat
violent
crime
financial
crime
and
help
secure
our
borders
hundreds
of
national
parks
would
be
forced
to
close
for
part
or
all
of
the
year
we
have
the
capacity
to
enforce
the
laws
that
protect
the
air
we
breathe
the
water
we
drink
or
the
food
that
we
eat
cuts
to
the
would
likely
result
in
more
flight
cancellations
delays
and
the
complete
elimination
of
air
traffic
control
services
in
parts
of
the
country
over
time
our
weather
forecasts
would
become
less
accurate
because
we
be
able
to
afford
to
launch
new
satellites
and
that
means
governors
and
mayors
would
have
to
wait
longer
to
order
evacuations
in
the
event
of
hurricane
just
partial
sampling
of
the
consequences
of
this
budget
now
you
can
anticipate
republicans
may
say
well
avoid
some
of
these
cuts
since
they
specify
exactly
the
cuts
that
they
would
make
but
they
can
only
avoid
some
of
these
cuts
if
they
cut
even
deeper
in
other
areas
this
is
math
if
they
want
to
make
smaller
cuts
to
medical
research
that
means
got
to
cut
even
deeper
in
funding
for
things
like
teaching
and
law
enforcement
the
converse
is
true
as
well
if
they
want
to
protect
early
childhood
education
it
will
mean
further
reducing
things
like
financial
aid
for
young
people
trying
to
afford
college
perhaps
they
will
never
tell
us
where
the
knife
will
fall
but
you
can
be
sure
that
with
cuts
this
deep
there
is
no
secret
plan
or
formula
that
will
be
able
to
protect
the
investments
we
need
to
help
our
economy
grow
this
is
not
conjecture
am
not
exaggerating
these
are
facts
and
these
are
just
the
cuts
that
would
happen
the
year
after
next
if
this
budget
became
law
by
the
middle
of
the
century
funding
for
the
kinds
of
things
just
mentioned
would
have
to
be
cut
by
about
percent
let
me
repeat
that
those
categories
just
mentioned
we
would
have
to
cut
by
percent
as
practical
matter
the
federal
budget
would
basically
amount
to
whatever
is
left
in
entitlements
spending
and
interest
on
the
national
debt
period
money
for
these
investments
that
have
traditionally
been
supported
on
bipartisan
basis
would
be
practically
eliminated
and
the
same
is
true
for
other
priorities
like
transportation
and
homeland
security
and
veterans
programs
for
the
men
and
women
who
have
risked
their
lives
for
this
country
this
is
not
an
exaggeration
check
it
out
yourself
and
this
is
to
say
nothing
about
what
the
budget
does
to
health
care
told
that
would
simply
be
handed
over
to
the
states
that
the
pitch
let
get
it
out
of
the
central
bureaucracy
the
states
can
experiment
they
be
able
to
run
the
programs
lot
better
but
here
the
deal
the
states
would
be
getting
they
would
have
to
be
running
these
programs
in
the
face
of
the
largest
cut
to
that
has
ever
been
proposed
cut
that
according
to
one
group
would
take
away
health
care
for
about
million
americans
million
who
are
these
americans
many
are
grandparents
who
without
be
able
to
afford
nursing
home
care
without
many
are
poor
children
some
are
families
who
have
children
with
autism
or
syndrome
some
are
kids
with
disabilities
so
severe
that
they
require
care
these
are
the
people
who
count
on
then
because
health
care
costs
keep
rising
and
the
baby
boom
generation
is
retiring
we
all
know
is
one
of
the
biggest
drivers
of
our
deficit
challenge
we
have
to
meet
by
bringing
down
the
cost
of
health
care
overall
so
that
seniors
and
taxpayers
can
share
in
the
savings
but
the
solution
proposed
by
the
republicans
in
washington
and
embraced
by
most
of
their
candidates
for
president
instead
of
being
enrolled
in
when
they
turn
seniors
who
retire
decade
from
now
would
get
voucher
that
equals
the
cost
of
the
second
cheapest
health
care
plan
in
their
area
if
is
more
expensive
than
that
private
plan
have
to
pay
more
if
they
want
to
enroll
in
traditional
if
health
care
costs
rise
faster
than
the
amount
of
the
voucher
as
by
the
way
been
doing
for
decades
too
bad
seniors
bear
the
risk
if
the
voucher
enough
to
buy
private
plan
with
the
specific
doctors
and
care
that
you
need
that
too
bad
so
most
experts
will
tell
you
the
way
this
voucher
plan
encourages
savings
is
not
through
better
care
at
cheaper
cost
the
way
these
private
insurance
companies
save
money
is
by
designing
and
marketing
plans
to
attract
the
youngest
and
healthiest
seniors
leaving
the
older
and
sicker
seniors
in
traditional
where
they
have
access
to
wide
range
of
doctors
and
guaranteed
care
but
that
of
course
makes
the
traditional
program
even
more
expensive
and
raise
premiums
even
further
the
net
result
is
that
our
country
will
end
up
spending
more
on
health
care
and
the
only
reason
the
government
will
save
any
money
it
be
on
our
books
is
because
shifted
it
to
seniors
bear
more
of
the
costs
themselves
bad
idea
and
it
will
ultimately
end
as
we
know
it
now
the
proponents
of
this
budget
will
tell
us
we
have
to
make
all
these
draconian
cuts
because
our
deficit
is
so
large
this
is
an
existential
crisis
we
have
to
think
about
future
generations
so
on
and
so
on
and
that
argument
might
have
shred
of
credibility
were
it
not
for
their
proposal
to
also
spend
trillion
over
the
next
decade
on
lower
tax
rates
told
that
these
tax
cuts
will
supposedly
be
paid
for
by
closing
loopholes
and
eliminating
wasteful
deductions
but
the
republicans
in
congress
refuse
to
list
single
tax
loophole
they
are
willing
to
close
not
one
and
by
the
way
there
is
no
way
to
get
even
close
to
trillion
in
savings
without
dramatically
reducing
all
kinds
of
tax
breaks
that
go
to
families
tax
breaks
for
health
care
tax
breaks
for
retirement
tax
breaks
for
meanwhile
these
proposed
tax
breaks
would
come
on
top
of
more
than
trillion
dollars
in
tax
for
people
making
more
than
year
an
average
of
at
least
for
every
millionaire
in
this
country
just
step
back
for
second
and
look
at
what
pays
for
worth
of
prescription
drug
coverage
for
senior
citizen
plus
new
school
computer
lab
plus
year
of
medical
care
for
returning
veteran
plus
medical
research
grant
for
chronic
disease
plus
salary
for
firefighter
or
police
officer
plus
tax
credit
to
make
year
of
college
more
affordable
plus
worth
of
financial
aid
one
hundred
fifty
thousand
dollars
could
pay
for
all
of
these
things
combined
investments
in
education
and
research
that
are
essential
to
economic
growth
that
benefits
all
of
us
for
that
would
be
going
to
each
millionaire
and
billionaire
in
this
country
this
budget
says
be
better
off
as
country
if
how
we
spend
it
this
is
supposed
to
be
about
paying
down
our
deficit
laughable
the
bipartisan
commission
that
created
which
the
republicans
originally
were
for
until
was
for
it
that
was
about
paying
down
the
deficit
and
agree
with
all
the
details
proposed
about
billion
more
in
revenue
and
billion
sorry
it
proposed
about
billion
more
in
revenue
and
about
billion
more
in
cuts
than
proposed
in
my
own
budget
but
was
serious
honest
balanced
effort
between
democrats
and
republicans
to
bring
down
the
deficit
why
although
it
differs
in
some
ways
my
budget
takes
similarly
balanced
approach
cuts
in
discretionary
spending
cuts
in
mandatory
spending
increased
revenue
this
congressional
republican
budget
is
something
different
altogether
it
is
horse
disguised
as
deficit
reduction
plans
it
is
really
an
attempt
to
impose
radical
vision
on
our
country
it
is
thinly
veiled
social
it
is
antithetical
to
our
entire
history
as
land
of
opportunity
and
upward
mobility
for
everybody
willing
to
work
for
it
place
where
prosperity
trickle
down
from
the
top
but
grows
outward
from
the
heart
of
the
middle
class
and
by
gutting
the
very
things
we
need
to
grow
an
economy
built
to
last
education
and
training
research
and
development
our
infrastructure
it
is
prescription
for
decline
and
everybody
here
should
understand
that
because
there
very
few
people
here
who
have
at
some
point
from
those
investments
that
were
made
in
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
part
of
how
we
got
ahead
and
now
we
going
to
be
pulling
up
those
ladders
up
for
the
next
generation
so
in
the
months
ahead
will
be
fighting
as
hard
as
know
how
for
this
truer
vision
of
what
the
united
states
of
america
is
all
about
absolutely
we
have
to
get
serious
about
the
deficit
and
that
will
require
tough
choices
and
sacrifice
and
already
shown
myself
willing
to
make
these
tough
choices
when
signed
into
law
the
biggest
spending
cut
of
any
president
in
recent
memory
in
fact
if
you
adjust
for
the
economy
the
congressional
budget
office
says
the
overall
spending
next
year
will
be
lower
than
any
year
under
and
willing
to
make
more
of
those
difficult
spending
decisions
in
the
months
ahead
but
said
it
before
and
say
it
again
there
has
to
be
some
balance
all
of
us
have
to
do
our
fair
share
also
put
forward
detailed
plan
that
would
reform
and
strengthen
and
by
the
beginning
of
the
next
decade
it
achieves
the
same
amount
of
annual
health
savings
as
the
plan
proposed
by
the
commission
and
it
does
so
by
making
changes
that
people
in
my
party
always
been
comfortable
with
but
instead
of
saving
money
by
shifting
costs
to
seniors
like
the
congressional
republican
plan
proposes
our
approach
would
lower
the
cost
of
health
care
throughout
the
entire
system
it
goes
after
excessive
subsidies
to
prescription
drug
companies
it
gets
more
efficiency
out
of
without
gutting
the
program
it
asks
the
very
wealthiest
seniors
to
pay
little
bit
more
it
changes
the
way
we
pay
for
health
care
not
by
procedure
or
the
number
of
days
spent
in
hospital
but
with
new
incentives
for
doctors
and
hospitals
to
improve
their
results
and
it
slows
the
growth
of
costs
by
strengthening
an
independent
commission
commission
not
made
up
of
bureaucrats
from
government
or
insurance
companies
but
doctors
and
nurses
and
medical
experts
and
consumers
who
will
look
at
all
the
evidence
and
recommend
the
best
way
to
reduce
unnecessary
health
care
spending
while
protecting
access
to
the
care
that
the
seniors
need
we
also
have
much
different
approach
when
it
comes
to
taxes
an
approach
that
says
if
serious
about
paying
down
our
debt
we
afford
to
spend
trillions
more
on
tax
cuts
for
folks
like
me
for
wealthy
americans
who
need
them
and
even
asking
for
them
and
that
the
country
can
not
afford
at
time
when
the
share
of
national
income
flowing
to
the
top
percent
of
people
in
this
country
has
climbed
to
levels
last
seen
in
the
those
same
folks
are
paying
taxes
at
one
of
the
lowest
rates
in
years
as
both
and
warren
have
pointed
out
many
times
now
paying
lower
tax
rate
than
his
secretary
that
is
not
fair
it
is
not
right
and
the
choice
is
really
very
simple
if
you
want
to
keep
these
tax
rates
and
deductions
in
place
or
give
even
more
tax
breaks
to
the
wealthy
as
the
republicans
in
congress
propose
then
one
of
two
things
happen
either
it
means
higher
deficits
or
it
means
more
sacrifice
from
the
middle
class
seniors
will
have
to
pay
more
for
college
students
will
lose
some
of
their
financial
aid
working
families
who
are
scraping
by
will
have
to
do
more
because
the
richest
americans
are
doing
less
repeat
what
said
before
that
is
not
class
warfare
that
is
not
class
envy
that
is
math
if
the
choice
that
members
of
congress
want
to
make
then
going
to
make
sure
every
american
knows
about
it
in
few
weeks
there
will
be
vote
on
what
called
the
rule
simple
concept
if
you
make
more
than
million
dollars
year
not
that
you
have
million
dollars
if
you
make
more
than
million
dollars
annually
then
you
should
pay
at
least
the
same
percentage
of
your
income
in
taxes
as
families
do
on
the
other
hand
if
you
make
under
year
like
percent
of
american
families
do
then
your
taxes
go
up
the
proposal
now
hear
some
people
point
out
that
the
rule
alone
raise
enough
revenue
to
solve
our
deficit
problems
maybe
not
but
definitely
step
in
the
right
direction
and
intend
to
keep
fighting
for
this
kind
of
balance
and
fairness
until
the
other
side
starts
listening
because
believe
this
is
what
the
american
people
want
believe
this
is
the
best
way
to
pay
for
the
investments
we
need
to
grow
our
economy
and
strengthen
the
middle
class
and
by
the
way
believe
the
right
thing
to
do
this
larger
debate
that
we
will
be
having
and
that
you
will
be
covering
in
the
coming
year
about
the
size
and
role
of
government
this
debate
has
been
with
us
since
our
founding
days
and
during
moments
of
great
challenge
and
change
like
the
ones
that
living
through
now
the
debate
gets
sharper
it
gets
more
vigorous
good
thing
as
country
that
prizes
both
our
individual
freedom
and
our
obligations
to
one
another
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
debates
that
we
can
have
but
no
matter
what
we
argue
or
where
we
stand
we
have
always
held
certain
beliefs
as
americans
we
believe
that
in
order
to
preserve
our
own
freedoms
and
pursue
our
own
happiness
we
just
think
about
ourselves
we
have
to
think
about
the
country
that
made
those
liberties
possible
we
have
to
think
about
our
fellow
citizens
with
whom
we
share
community
we
have
to
think
about
required
to
preserve
the
american
dream
for
future
generations
and
this
sense
of
responsibility
to
each
other
and
our
country
this
partisan
feeling
this
democratic
or
republican
idea
patriotism
and
if
we
keep
that
in
mind
and
uphold
our
obligations
to
one
another
and
to
this
larger
enterprise
that
is
america
then
have
no
doubt
that
we
will
continue
our
long
and
prosperous
journey
as
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
please
have
seat
sorry
running
just
little
bit
behind
but
figured
great
day
to
enjoy
the
rose
garden
today
members
of
congress
have
simple
choice
to
make
they
can
stand
with
the
big
oil
companies
or
they
can
stand
with
the
american
people
right
now
the
biggest
oil
companies
are
raking
in
record
profits
profits
that
go
up
every
time
folks
pull
up
into
gas
station
but
on
top
of
these
record
profits
oil
companies
are
also
getting
billions
year
billions
year
in
taxpayer
subsidies
subsidy
that
enjoyed
year
after
year
for
the
last
century
think
about
that
like
hitting
the
american
people
twice
already
paying
premium
at
the
pump
right
now
and
on
top
of
that
congress
up
until
this
point
has
thought
it
was
good
idea
to
send
billions
of
dollars
more
in
tax
dollars
to
the
oil
industry
not
as
if
these
companies
stand
on
their
own
last
year
the
three
biggest
oil
companies
took
home
more
than
billion
in
profits
pocketed
nearly
million
every
hour
and
when
the
price
of
oil
goes
up
prices
at
the
pump
go
up
and
so
do
these
profits
in
fact
one
analysis
shows
that
every
time
gas
goes
up
by
penny
these
companies
usually
pocket
another
million
in
quarterly
profits
meanwhile
these
companies
pay
lower
tax
rate
than
most
other
companies
on
their
investments
partly
because
giving
them
billions
in
tax
every
year
now
want
to
make
clear
we
all
know
that
drilling
for
oil
has
to
be
key
part
of
our
overall
energy
strategy
we
want
oil
companies
to
be
doing
well
we
want
them
to
succeed
why
under
my
administration
opened
up
millions
of
acres
of
federal
lands
and
waters
to
oil
and
gas
production
quadrupled
the
number
of
operating
oil
rigs
to
record
high
added
enough
oil
and
gas
pipeline
to
circle
the
earth
and
then
some
and
just
yesterday
we
announced
the
next
step
for
potential
new
oil
and
gas
exploration
in
the
atlantic
so
the
fact
is
producing
more
oil
right
now
than
we
have
in
eight
years
and
importing
less
of
it
as
well
for
two
years
in
row
america
has
bought
less
oil
from
other
countries
than
we
produce
here
at
home
for
the
first
time
in
over
decade
so
american
oil
is
booming
the
oil
industry
is
doing
just
fine
with
record
profits
and
rising
production
not
worried
about
the
big
oil
companies
with
high
oil
prices
around
the
world
got
more
than
enough
incentive
to
produce
even
more
oil
why
think
time
they
got
by
without
more
help
from
taxpayers
who
are
already
having
tough
enough
time
paying
the
bills
and
filling
up
their
gas
tank
and
think
curious
that
some
folks
in
congress
who
are
the
first
to
belittle
investments
in
new
sources
of
energy
are
the
ones
that
are
fighting
the
hardest
to
maintain
these
for
the
oil
companies
instead
of
taxpayer
to
an
industry
never
been
more
profitable
we
should
be
using
that
money
to
on
investments
in
clean
energy
technologies
that
have
never
been
more
promising
investments
in
wind
power
and
solar
power
and
investments
in
cars
and
trucks
and
homes
and
buildings
the
future
the
only
way
we
going
to
break
this
cycle
of
high
gas
prices
that
happen
year
after
year
after
year
as
the
economy
is
growing
the
only
time
you
start
seeing
lower
gas
prices
is
when
the
economy
is
doing
badly
not
the
kind
of
pattern
that
we
want
to
be
in
we
want
the
economy
doing
well
and
people
to
be
able
to
afford
their
energy
costs
and
keep
in
mind
we
just
drill
our
way
out
of
this
problem
as
said
oil
production
here
in
the
united
states
is
doing
very
well
and
it
been
doing
well
even
as
gas
prices
are
going
up
well
the
reason
is
because
we
use
more
than
percent
of
the
oil
but
we
only
have
percent
of
the
known
oil
reserves
and
that
means
we
could
drill
every
drop
of
american
oil
tomorrow
but
still
have
to
buy
oil
from
other
countries
to
make
up
the
difference
still
have
to
depend
on
other
countries
to
meet
our
energy
needs
and
because
world
market
the
fact
that
doing
more
here
in
the
united
states
necessarily
help
us
because
even
oil
companies
selling
that
oil
on
worldwide
market
not
keeping
it
just
for
us
and
that
means
that
if
rising
demand
around
the
world
then
the
prices
are
going
to
up
not
the
future
that
want
for
america
want
folks
like
these
back
here
and
the
folks
in
front
of
me
to
have
to
pay
more
at
the
pump
every
time
that
some
unrest
in
the
middle
east
and
oil
speculators
get
nervous
about
whether
going
to
be
enough
supply
want
our
kids
to
be
held
hostage
to
events
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
want
us
to
control
our
own
destiny
want
us
to
forge
our
own
future
and
why
as
long
as
president
america
is
going
to
pursue
an
energy
strategy
which
means
we
will
continue
developing
our
oil
and
gas
resources
in
robust
and
responsible
way
but
it
also
means
that
going
to
keep
developing
more
advanced
the
kinds
that
are
already
powering
truck
fleets
across
america
going
to
keep
investing
in
clean
energy
like
the
wind
power
and
solar
power
already
lighting
thousands
of
homes
and
creating
thousands
of
jobs
going
to
keep
manufacturing
more
cars
and
trucks
to
get
more
miles
to
the
gallon
so
that
you
can
fill
up
once
every
two
weeks
instead
of
every
week
going
to
keep
building
more
homes
and
businesses
that
waste
less
energy
so
that
in
charge
of
your
own
energy
bills
going
to
do
all
of
this
by
harnessing
our
most
inexhaustible
resource
american
ingenuity
and
american
imagination
what
we
need
to
keep
going
at
stake
right
now
the
choice
that
we
face
and
the
choice
facing
congress
today
they
can
either
vote
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
more
in
oil
subsidies
that
keep
us
trapped
in
the
past
or
they
can
vote
to
end
these
taxpayer
subsidies
that
needed
to
boost
oil
production
so
that
we
can
invest
in
the
future
that
simple
and
as
long
as
president
betting
on
the
future
and
as
the
people
talked
to
around
the
country
including
the
people
who
are
behind
me
here
today
they
put
their
faith
in
the
future
as
well
what
we
do
as
americans
who
we
are
we
innovate
we
discover
we
seek
new
solutions
to
some
of
our
biggest
challenges
and
ultimately
because
we
stick
with
it
we
succeed
and
believe
that
going
to
do
that
again
today
the
american
people
are
going
to
be
watching
congress
to
see
if
they
have
that
same
faith
thank
you
very
much
everybody
well
good
morning
everyone
rosy

you
for
your
kind
words

your
term

your
commitment

of
directors

my
friends

the
chicago
delegation
also
want

the
members

next
few
days

worked
hard

maintain
the
partnership
between

impressed
to
see
so
many
young
people
here
you
do
yet
get

front
seats
understand
you
have
to
earn
that
but
students
from
all
over
the
country
who
are
making
their
voices
heard
and
engaging
deeply
in
our
democratic
debate
you
carry
with
you
an
extraordinary
legacy
of
more
than
six
decades
of
friendship
between
the
united
states
and
israel
and
you
have
the
opportunity
and
the
responsibility
to
make
your
own
mark
on
the
world
and
for
inspiration
you
can
look
to
the
man
who
preceded
me
on
this
stage
who
being
at
this
conference
my
friend
president
was
born
world
away
from
here
in
in
what
was
then
poland
few
years
after
the
end
of
the
first
world
war
but
his
heart
was
always
in
israel
the
historic
homeland
of
the
jewish
people
and
when
he
was
just
boy
he
made
his
journey
across
land
and
sea
toward
home
in
his
life
he
has
fought
for
independence
and
he
has
fought
for
peace
and
security
as
member
of
the
and
member
of
the
knesset
as
minister
of
and
foreign
affairs
as
prime
minister
and
as
president
helped
build
the
nation
that
thrives
today
the
jewish
state
of
israel
but
beyond
these
extraordinary
achievements
he
has
also
been
powerful
moral
voice
that
reminds
us
that
right
makes
might
not
the
other
way
around
once
described
the
story
of
the
jewish
people
by
saying
it
proved
that
slings
arrows
and
gas
chambers
can
annihilate
man
but
can
not
destroy
human
values
dignity
and
freedom
and
he
has
lived
those
values
he
has
taught
us
to
ask
more
of
ourselves
and
to
more
with
our
fellow
human
beings
am
grateful
for
his
life
work
and
his
moral
example
and
proud
to
announce
that
later
this
spring
will
invite
to
the
white
house
to
present
him
with
highest
civilian
the
presidential
medal
of
freedom
in
many
ways
this
award
is
symbol
of
the
broader
ties
that
bind
our
nations
the
united
states
and
israel
share
interests
but
we
also
share
those
human
values
that
spoke
about
commitment
to
human
dignity
belief
that
freedom
is
right
that
is
given
to
all
of
god
children
an
experience
that
shows
us
that
democracy
is
the
one
and
only
form
of
government
that
can
truly
respond
to
the
aspirations
of
citizens
founding
fathers
understood
this
truth
just
as
founding
generation
did
president
put
it
well
describing
his
decision
to
formally
israel
only
minutes
after
it
declared
independence
he
said
had
faith
in
israel
before
it
was
established
believe
it
has
glorious
future
before
it
as
not
just
another
sovereign
nation
but
as
an
embodiment
of
the
great
ideals
of
our
for
over
six
decades
the
american
people
have
kept
that
faith
yes
we
are
bound
to
israel
because
of
the
interests
that
we
share
in
security
for
our
communities
prosperity
for
our
people
the
new
frontiers
of
science
that
can
light
the
world
but
ultimately
it
is
our
common
ideals
that
provide
the
true
foundation
for
our
relationship
that
is
why
commitment
to
israel
has
endured
under
democratic
and
republican
presidents
and
congressional
leaders
of
both
parties
in
the
united
states
our
support
for
israel
is
bipartisan
and
that
is
how
it
should
stay
work
continually
nurtures
this
bond
and
because
of
effectiveness
in
carrying
out
its
mission
you
can
expect
that
over
the
next
several
days
you
will
hear
many
fine
words
from
elected
officials
describing
their
commitment
to
the
relationship
but
as
you
examine
my
commitment
you
just
have
to
count
on
my
words
you
can
look
at
my
deeds
because
over
the
last
three
years
as
president
of
the
united
states
have
kept
my
commitments
to
the
state
of
israel
at
every
crucial
juncture
at
every
fork
in
the
road
we
have
been
there
for
israel
every
single
time
four
years
ago
stood
before
you
and
said
that
security
is
sacrosanct
it
is
that
belief
has
guided
my
actions
as
president
the
fact
is
my
commitment
to
security
has
been
unprecedented
our
military
and
intelligence
cooperation
has
never
been
closer
our
joint
exercises
and
training
have
never
been
more
robust
despite
tough
budget
environment
our
security
assistance
has
increased
every
single
year
we
are
investing
in
new
capabilities
providing
israel
with
more
advanced
technology
the
types
of
products
and
systems
that
only
go
to
our
closest
friends
and
allies
and
make
no
mistake
we
will
do
what
it
takes
to
preserve
qualitative
military
edge
because
israel
must
always
have
the
ability
to
defend
itself
by
itself
against
any
threat
this
just
about
numbers
on
balance
sheet
as
senator
spoke
to
israeli
troops
on
the
border
visited
with
families
known
the
terror
of
rocket
fire
in
and
why
as
president
have
provided
critical
funding
to
deploy
the
iron
dome
system
that
has
intercepted
rockets
that
might
have
hit
homes
and
hospitals
and
schools
in
that
town
and
in
others
now
our
assistance
is
expanding
defensive
capabilities
so
that
more
israelis
can
live
free
from
the
fear
of
rockets
and
ballistic
missiles
because
no
family
no
citizen
should
live
in
fear
and
just
as
been
there
with
our
security
assistance
we
been
there
through
our
diplomacy
when
the
report
unfairly
out
israel
for
criticism
we
challenged
it
when
israel
was
isolated
in
the
aftermath
of
the
flotilla
incident
we
supported
them
when
the
durban
conference
was
commemorated
we
boycotted
it
and
we
will
always
reject
the
notion
that
zionism
is
racism
when
resolutions
are
brought
up
at
the
human
rights
council
we
oppose
them
when
israeli
diplomats
feared
for
their
lives
in
cairo
we
intervened
to
save
them
when
there
are
efforts
to
boycott
or
divest
from
israel
we
will
stand
against
them
and
whenever
an
effort
is
made
to
the
state
of
israel
my
administration
has
opposed
them
so
there
should
not
be
shred
of
doubt
by
now
when
the
chips
are
down
have
back
which
is
why
if
during
this
political
season
you
hear
some
questions
regarding
my
support
for
israel
remember
that
not
backed
up
by
the
facts
and
remember
that
the
relationship
is
simply
too
important
to
be
distorted
by
partisan
politics
national
security
is
too
important
security
is
too
important
of
course
there
are
those
who
question
not
my
security
and
diplomatic
commitments
but
rather
my
ongoing
pursuit
of
peace
between
israelis
and
so
let
me
say
this
make
no
apologies
for
pursuing
peace
own
leaders
understand
the
necessity
of
peace
prime
minister
minister
president
each
of
them
have
called
for
two
states
secure
israel
that
lives
side
by
side
with
an
independent
state
believe
that
peace
is
profoundly
in
security
interest
the
reality
that
israel
faces
from
shifting
demographics
to
emerging
technologies
to
an
extremely
difficult
international
environment
demands
resolution
of
this
issue
and
believe
that
peace
with
the
is
consistent
with
founding
values
because
of
our
shared
belief
in
and
because
place
as
jewish
and
democratic
state
must
be
protected
of
course
peace
is
hard
to
achieve
reason
why
it
remained
elusive
for
six
decades
the
upheaval
and
uncertainty
in
makes
it
that
much
harder
from
the
horrific
violence
raging
in
syria
to
the
transition
in
egypt
and
the
division
within
the
leadership
makes
it
harder
still
most
notably
with
continued
rejection
of
very
right
to
exist
but
as
hard
as
it
may
be
we
should
not
and
can
not
give
in
to
cynicism
or
despair
the
changes
taking
place
in
the
region
make
peace
more
important
not
less
and
made
it
clear
that
there
will
be
no
lasting
peace
unless
security
concerns
are
met
that
why
we
continue
to
press
arab
leaders
to
reach
out
to
israel
and
will
continue
to
support
the
peace
treaty
with
egypt
why
just
as
we
encourage
israel
to
be
resolute
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
we
have
continued
to
insist
that
any
partner
must
right
to
exist
and
reject
violence
and
adhere
to
existing
agreements
and
that
is
why
my
administration
has
consistently
rejected
any
efforts
to
negotiations
or
impose
an
agreement
on
the
parties
as
rosy
noted
last
year
stood
before
you
and
pledged
that
the
united
states
will
stand
up
against
efforts
to
single
israel
out
at
the
united
nations
as
you
know
that
pledge
has
been
kept
last
september
stood
before
the
united
nations
general
assembly
and
reaffirmed
that
any
lasting
peace
must
acknowledge
the
fundamental
legitimacy
of
israel
and
its
security
concerns
said
that
commitment
to
security
is
unshakeable
our
friendship
with
israel
is
enduring
and
that
israel
must
be
no
american
president
has
made
such
clear
statement
about
our
support
for
israel
at
the
united
nations
at
such
difficult
time
people
usually
give
those
speeches
before
audiences
like
this
one
not
before
the
general
assembly
and
must
say
there
was
not
lot
of
applause
but
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
as
result
today
there
is
no
doubt
anywhere
in
the
world
that
the
united
states
will
insist
upon
security
and
legitimacy
that
will
be
true
as
we
continue
our
efforts
to
pursue
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
and
that
will
be
true
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
that
is
such
focus
for
all
of
us
today
nuclear
program
threat
that
has
the
potential
to
bring
together
the
worst
rhetoric
about
destruction
with
the
most
dangerous
weapons
begin
with
basic
truth
that
you
all
understand
no
israeli
government
can
tolerate
nuclear
weapon
in
the
hands
of
regime
that
denies
the
holocaust
threatens
to
wipe
israel
off
the
map
and
sponsors
terrorist
groups
committed
to
destruction
and
so
understand
the
profound
historical
obligation
that
weighs
on
the
shoulders
of
and
and
all
of
leaders
iran
is
completely
counter
to
security
interests
but
it
is
also
counter
to
the
national
security
interests
of
the
united
states
indeed
the
entire
world
has
an
interest
in
preventing
iran
from
acquiring
nuclear
weapon
iran
would
thoroughly
undermine
the
regime
that
we
done
so
much
to
build
there
are
risks
that
an
iranian
nuclear
weapon
could
fall
into
the
hands
of
terrorist
it
is
almost
certain
that
others
in
the
region
would
feel
compelled
to
get
their
own
nuclear
weapon
triggering
an
arms
race
in
one
of
the
world
most
volatile
regions
it
would
embolden
regime
that
has
its
own
people
and
it
would
embolden
proxies
who
have
carried
out
terrorist
attacks
from
the
to
asia
and
that
is
why
four
years
ago
made
commitment
to
the
american
people
and
said
that
we
would
use
all
elements
of
american
power
to
pressure
iran
and
prevent
it
from
acquiring
nuclear
weapon
and
that
is
what
we
have
done
when
took
office
the
efforts
to
apply
pressure
on
iran
were
in
tatters
iran
had
gone
from
zero
centrifuges
spinning
to
thousands
without
facing
broad
from
the
world
in
the
region
iran
was
ascendant
increasingly
popular
and
extending
its
reach
in
other
words
the
iranian
leadership
was
united
and
on
the
move
and
the
international
community
was
divided
about
how
to
go
forward
and
so
from
my
very
first
months
in
office
we
put
forward
very
clear
choice
to
the
iranian
regime
path
that
would
allow
them
to
rejoin
the
community
of
nations
if
they
meet
their
international
obligations
or
path
that
leads
to
an
escalating
series
of
consequences
if
they
do
in
fact
our
policy
of
engagement
quickly
rebuffed
by
the
iranian
regime
allowed
us
to
rally
the
international
community
as
never
before
to
expose
intransigence
and
to
apply
pressure
that
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
the
united
states
could
do
on
our
own
because
of
our
efforts
iran
is
under
greater
pressure
than
ever
before
some
of
you
will
recall
people
predicted
that
russia
and
china
join
us
to
move
toward
pressure
they
did
and
in
the
security
council
overwhelmingly
supported
comprehensive
sanctions
effort
few
thought
that
sanctions
could
have
an
immediate
bite
on
the
iranian
regime
they
have
slowing
the
iranian
nuclear
program
and
virtually
grinding
the
iranian
economy
to
halt
in
many
questioned
whether
we
could
hold
our
coalition
together
as
we
moved
against
central
bank
and
oil
exports
but
our
friends
in
europe
and
asia
and
elsewhere
are
joining
us
and
in
the
iranian
government
faces
the
prospect
of
even
more
crippling
sanctions
that
is
where
we
are
today
because
of
our
work
iran
is
isolated
its
leadership
divided
and
under
pressure
and
by
the
way
the
arab
spring
has
only
increased
these
trends
as
the
hypocrisy
of
the
iranian
regime
is
exposed
and
its
ally
the
regime
is
crumbling
of
course
so
long
as
iran
fails
to
meet
its
obligations
this
problem
remains
unresolved
the
effective
implementation
of
our
policy
is
not
enough
we
must
accomplish
our
objective
and
in
that
effort
firmly
believe
that
an
opportunity
still
remains
for
diplomacy
backed
by
pressure
to
succeed
the
united
states
and
israel
both
assess
that
iran
does
not
yet
have
nuclear
weapon
and
we
are
exceedingly
vigilant
in
monitoring
their
program
now
the
international
community
has
responsibility
to
use
the
time
and
space
that
exists
sanctions
are
continuing
to
increase
and
this
july
thanks
to
our
diplomatic
coordination
european
ban
on
iranian
oil
imports
will
take
hold
faced
with
these
increasingly
dire
consequences
leaders
still
have
the
opportunity
to
make
the
right
decision
they
can
choose
path
that
brings
them
back
into
the
community
of
nations
or
they
can
continue
down
dead
end
and
given
their
history
there
are
of
course
no
guarantees
that
the
iranian
regime
will
make
the
right
choice
but
both
israel
and
the
united
states
have
an
interest
in
seeing
this
challenge
resolved
diplomatically
after
all
the
only
way
to
truly
solve
this
problem
is
for
the
iranian
government
to
make
decision
to
forsake
nuclear
weapons
what
history
tells
us
moreover
as
president
and
have
deeply
held
preference
for
peace
over
war
have
sent
men
and
women
into
way
seen
the
consequences
of
those
decisions
in
the
eyes
of
those
meet
who
come
back
gravely
wounded
and
the
absence
of
those
who
make
it
home
long
after
leave
this
office
will
remember
those
moments
as
the
most
searing
of
my
presidency
and
for
this
reason
as
part
of
my
solemn
obligation
to
the
american
people
will
only
use
force
when
the
time
and
circumstances
demand
it
and
know
that
israeli
leaders
also
know
all
too
well
the
costs
and
consequences
of
war
even
as
they
their
obligation
to
defend
their
country
we
all
prefer
to
resolve
this
issue
diplomatically
having
said
that
leaders
should
have
no
doubt
about
the
resolve
of
the
united
states
just
as
they
should
not
doubt
sovereign
right
to
make
its
own
decisions
about
what
is
required
to
meet
its
security
needs
have
said
that
when
it
comes
to
preventing
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
will
take
no
options
off
the
table
and
mean
what
say
that
includes
all
elements
of
american
power
political
effort
aimed
at
isolating
iran
diplomatic
effort
to
sustain
our
coalition
and
ensure
that
the
iranian
program
is
monitored
an
economic
effort
that
imposes
crippling
sanctions
and
yes
military
effort
to
be
prepared
for
any
contingency
leaders
should
understand
that
do
not
have
policy
of
containment
have
policy
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
and
as
have
made
clear
time
and
again
during
the
course
of
my
presidency
will
not
hesitate
to
use
force
when
it
is
necessary
to
defend
the
united
states
and
its
interests
moving
forward
would
ask
that
we
all
remember
the
of
these
issues
the
stakes
involved
for
israel
for
america
and
for
the
world
already
there
is
too
much
loose
talk
of
war
over
the
last
few
weeks
such
talk
has
only
benefited
the
iranian
government
by
driving
up
the
price
of
oil
which
they
depend
on
to
fund
their
nuclear
program
for
the
sake
of
security
security
and
the
peace
and
security
of
the
world
now
is
not
the
time
for
bluster
now
is
the
time
to
let
our
increased
pressure
sink
in
and
to
sustain
the
broad
international
coalition
we
have
built
now
is
the
time
to
heed
the
timeless
advice
from
teddy
speak
softly
carry
big
stick
and
as
we
do
rest
assured
that
the
iranian
government
will
know
our
resolve
and
that
our
coordination
with
israel
will
continue
these
are
challenging
times
but
we
been
through
challenging
times
before
and
the
united
states
and
israel
have
come
through
them
together
because
of
our
cooperation
citizens
in
both
our
countries
have
benefited
from
the
bonds
that
bring
us
together
proud
to
be
one
of
those
people
in
the
past
shared
in
this
forum
just
why
those
bonds
are
so
personal
for
me
the
stories
of
great
uncle
who
helped
liberate
to
my
memories
of
returning
there
with
from
sharing
books
with
president
to
sharing
with
my
young
staff
in
tradition
that
started
on
the
campaign
trail
and
continues
in
the
white
house
from
the
countless
friends
know
in
this
room
to
the
concept
of
that
has
enriched
and
guided
my
life
as
harry
understood
story
is
one
of
hope
we
may
not
agree
on
every
single
issue
no
two
nations
do
and
our
democracies
contain
vibrant
diversity
of
views
but
we
agree
on
the
big
things
the
things
that
matter
and
together
we
are
working
to
build
better
world
one
where
our
people
can
live
free
from
fear
one
where
peace
is
founded
upon
justice
one
where
our
children
can
know
future
that
is
more
hopeful
than
the
present
there
is
no
shortage
of
speeches
on
the
friendship
between
the
united
states
and
israel
but
also
mindful
of
the
proverb
man
is
judged
by
his
deeds
not
his
words
so
if
you
want
to
know
where
my
heart
lies
look
no
further
than
what
have
done
to
stand
up
for
israel
to
secure
both
of
our
countries
and
to
see
that
the
rough
waters
of
our
time
lead
to
peaceful
and
prosperous
shore
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
people
of
israel
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
for
not
only
outstanding
remarks
but
the
extraordinary
leadership
you
showed
in
helping
to
guide
our
policies
to
secretary
general
to
all
the
commanders
who
are
here
and
did
so
much
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
to
arrive
at
an
outcome
in
which
the
iraqi
people
have
an
opportunity
to
chart
their
own
destiny
thank
you
for
the
great
work
that
you
done
do
have
to
say
despite
advice
thought
was
going
to
burst
into
song
laughter
you
have
not
lived
until
you
hear
him
belt
out
an
irish
ballad
his
voice
is
better
than
mine
think
you
never
prophet
in
your
own
land
so
your
wives
are
there
to
cut
you
down
peg
distinguished
guests
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
house
has
stood
for
more
than
two
centuries
through
war
and
peace
through
hardship
and
through
prosperity
these
rooms
have
hosted
presidents
and
prime
ministers
and
kings
and
queens
but
in
the
history
of
this
house
there
never
been
night
quite
like
this
because
this
evening
we
welcome
not
the
statesmen
who
decide
great
questions
of
war
and
peace
but
citizens
men
and
women
from
every
corner
of
our
country
from
every
rank
of
our
military
every
branch
of
our
service
who
answer
the
call
who
go
to
war
who
defend
the
peace
and
in
culture
that
celebrates
fame
and
fortune
yours
are
not
necessarily
household
names
they
something
more
the
patriots
who
serve
in
our
name
and
after
nearly
years
of
war
in
iraq
tonight
is
an
opportunity
for
us
to
express
our
gratitude
and
to
say
once
more
welcome
home
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
we
paid
tribute
to
those
who
served
courageously
in
iraq
this
will
not
be
the
last
and
history
reminds
us
of
our
obligations
as
nation
at
moments
like
this
this
year
will
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
war
time
when
our
veterans
did
always
receive
the
respect
and
the
thanks
that
they
so
richly
deserved
and
that
mistake
that
we
must
never
repeat
the
good
news
is
already
we
seen
americans
come
together
in
small
towns
and
big
cities
all
across
the
country
to
your
service
in
iraq
and
tonight
on
behalf
of
and
myself
on
behalf
of
over
americans
million
americans
we
want
to
express
those
simple
words
that
we
can
never
say
enough
and
that
thank
you
in
your
heart
each
of
you
carries
your
own
story
the
pride
of
job
well
done
the
pain
of
losing
friend
comrade
who
celebrated
our
in
world
war
said
that
your
world
can
never
be
known
to
the
rest
of
us
tonight
what
we
can
do
is
convey
what
you
meant
to
the
rest
of
us
because
through
the
dust
and
the
din
and
the
fog
of
war
the
glory
of
your
service
always
shone
through
in
your
noble
example
we
see
the
virtues
and
the
values
that
sustain
america
that
keep
this
country
great
you
taught
us
about
duty
blessed
to
live
in
the
land
of
the
free
you
could
have
opted
for
an
easier
path
but
you
know
that
freedom
is
not
free
and
so
you
volunteered
and
you
stepped
forward
and
you
raised
your
hand
and
you
took
an
oath
to
protect
and
defend
to
serve
cause
greater
than
yourself
knowing
in
time
of
war
you
could
be
sent
into
harm
way
you
taught
us
about
resolve
invasion
turned
to
insurgency
and
then
sectarian
strife
but
you
persevered
tour
after
tour
year
after
year
indeed
we
mindful
that
even
as
we
gather
here
iraq
veterans
continue
to
risk
their
lives
in
and
our
prayers
are
with
them
all
tonight
in
one
of
our
nation
longest
wars
you
wrote
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
chapters
in
american
military
history
now
the
iraqi
people
have
chance
to
forge
their
own
destiny
and
every
one
of
you
who
served
there
can
take
pride
in
knowing
you
gave
the
iraqis
this
opportunity
that
you
succeeded
in
your
mission
you
taught
us
about
devotion
to
country
and
to
comrades
but
most
of
all
to
family
because
know
that
some
of
the
hardest
days
of
war
were
the
moments
you
missed
back
home
the
birthdays
the
anniversaries
when
your
little
girl
or
boy
took
their
first
wobbly
steps
and
behind
every
one
of
you
was
parent
spouse
son
or
daughter
trying
to
stay
strong
and
praying
for
the
day
that
you
come
home
safe
and
that
why
and
have
made
it
their
mission
to
make
sure
america
takes
care
of
your
families
because
they
inspire
us
as
much
as
you
do
and
they
deserve
that
as
much
as
you
do
that
why
ask
all
the
spouses
and
the
partners
and
families
to
stand
up
and
accept
our
gratitude
for
your
remarkable
service
especially
because
you
look
so
good
tonight
you
taught
us
about
sacrifice
love
of
country
so
deep
so
profound
you
were
willing
to
give
your
lives
for
it
and
tonight
we
pay
solemn
tribute
to
all
who
did
we
remember
the
first
on
that
first
day
of
war
major
jay
thomas
captain
corporal
matthew
kennedy
staff
sergeant
and
we
remember
the
last
specialist
david
november
separated
by
nearly
years
they
are
bound
for
all
time
among
the
nearly
american
patriots
who
gave
all
that
they
had
to
give
to
their
families
including
the
gold
star
families
here
tonight
know
that
we
will
never
forget
their
sacrifice
and
that
your
loved
ones
live
on
in
the
soul
of
our
nation
now
and
forever
you
taught
us
about
strength
the
kind
that
comes
from
within
the
kind
that
we
see
in
our
wounded
warriors
for
you
coming
home
was
the
start
of
another
battle
the
battle
to
recover
to
stand
to
walk
to
serve
again
and
in
your
resilience
we
see
the
essence
of
america
because
we
do
not
give
up
no
matter
the
hardship
we
push
on
and
just
as
the
wounds
of
war
can
last
lifetime
so
does
america
commitment
to
you
and
all
who
serve
to
give
you
the
care
you
earned
and
the
opportunities
you
need
as
you
begin
the
next
proud
chapter
in
your
lives
and
finally
all
of
you
taught
us
lesson
about
the
character
of
our
country
as
you
look
across
this
room
tonight
you
look
at
our
military
we
draw
strength
from
every
part
of
our
american
family
every
every
creed
every
background
every
belief
and
every
day
you
succeed
together
as
one
american
team
as
your
commander
in
chief
could
not
be
more
proud
of
you
as
an
american
as
husband
and
father
of
two
daughters
could
not
be
more
grateful
for
your
example
of
the
kind
of
country
we
can
be
of
what
we
can
achieve
when
we
stick
together
so
leave
you
with
picture
that
captures
this
spirit
it
from
that
day
in
december
when
the
last
convoy
rolled
out
five
american
soldiers
standing
beside
their
vehicle
marked
with
the
words
last
vehicle
out
of
iraq
they
young
men
and
women
shoulder
to
shoulder
proud
heads
held
high
finally
going
home
and
they
were
asked
what
it
was
like
to
be
literally
the
last
troops
out
of
iraq
and
one
of
them
gave
simple
reply
we
completed
the
mission
we
completed
the
mission
we
did
our
jobs
so
propose
toast
to
the
country
we
love
to
the
men
and
women
who
defend
her
and
to
that
faith
that
fundamental
american
says
no
mission
is
too
hard
no
challenge
is
too
great
through
tests
and
through
trials
we
do
simply
endure
we
emerge
stronger
than
before
knowing
that
america
greatest
days
are
still
to
come
and
they
are
great
because
of
you
cheers
president
offers
toast
god
bless
you
and
your
families
and
may
god
continue
to
bless
those
in
uniform
and
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
everybody
may
dinner
be
served
thank
you
thank
you
please
be
seated
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
distinguished
guests
and
fellow
americans
last
month
went
to
air
force
base
and
welcomed
home
some
of
our
last
troops
to
serve
in
iraq
together
we
offered
final
proud
salute
to
the
under
which
more
than
million
of
our
fellow
citizens
fought
and
several
thousand
gave
their
lives
we
gather
tonight
knowing
that
this
generation
of
has
made
the
united
states
safer
and
more
respected
around
the
world
for
the
first
time
in
nine
years
there
are
no
americans
fighting
in
iraq
for
the
first
time
in
two
decades
bin
laden
is
not
threat
to
this
country
most
of
top
lieutenants
have
been
defeated
the
momentum
has
been
broken
and
some
troops
in
have
begun
to
come
home
these
achievements
are
testament
to
the
courage
and
teamwork
of
armed
forces
at
time
when
too
many
of
our
institutions
have
let
us
down
they
exceed
all
expectations
not
consumed
with
personal
ambition
they
obsess
over
their
differences
they
focus
on
the
mission
at
hand
they
work
together
imagine
what
we
could
accomplish
if
we
followed
their
example
think
about
the
america
within
our
reach
country
that
leads
the
world
in
educating
its
people
an
america
that
attracts
new
generation
of
manufacturing
and
jobs
future
where
in
control
of
our
own
energy
and
our
security
and
prosperity
so
tied
to
unstable
parts
of
the
world
an
economy
built
to
last
where
hard
work
pays
off
and
responsibility
is
rewarded
we
can
do
this
know
we
can
because
done
it
before
at
the
end
of
world
war
when
another
generation
of
returned
home
from
combat
they
built
the
strongest
economy
and
middle
class
the
world
has
ever
known
my
grandfather
veteran
of
army
got
the
chance
to
go
to
college
on
the
bill
my
grandmother
who
worked
on
bomber
assembly
line
was
part
of
workforce
that
turned
out
the
best
products
on
earth
the
two
of
them
shared
the
optimism
of
nation
that
had
triumphed
over
depression
and
fascism
they
understood
they
were
part
of
something
larger
that
they
were
contributing
to
story
of
success
that
every
american
had
chance
to
share
the
basic
american
promise
that
if
you
worked
hard
you
could
do
well
enough
to
raise
family
own
home
send
your
kids
to
college
and
put
little
away
for
retirement
the
defining
issue
of
our
time
is
how
to
keep
that
promise
alive
no
challenge
is
more
urgent
no
debate
is
more
important
we
can
either
settle
for
country
where
shrinking
number
of
people
do
really
well
while
growing
number
of
americans
barely
get
by
or
we
can
restore
an
economy
where
everyone
gets
fair
shot
and
everyone
does
their
fair
share
and
everyone
plays
by
the
same
set
of
rules
at
stake
democratic
values
or
republican
values
but
american
values
and
we
have
to
reclaim
them
remember
how
we
got
here
long
before
the
recession
jobs
and
manufacturing
began
leaving
our
shores
technology
made
businesses
more
efficient
but
also
made
some
jobs
obsolete
folks
at
the
top
saw
their
incomes
rise
like
never
before
but
most
hardworking
americans
struggled
with
costs
that
were
growing
that
and
personal
debt
that
kept
piling
up
in
the
house
of
cards
collapsed
we
learned
that
mortgages
had
been
sold
to
people
who
afford
or
understand
them
banks
had
made
huge
bets
and
bonuses
with
other
money
regulators
had
looked
the
other
way
or
have
the
authority
to
stop
the
bad
it
was
wrong
it
was
irresponsible
and
it
plunged
our
economy
into
crisis
that
put
millions
out
of
work
saddled
us
with
more
debt
and
left
innocent
hardworking
americans
holding
the
bag
in
the
six
months
before
took
office
we
lost
nearly
million
jobs
and
we
lost
another
million
before
our
policies
were
in
full
effect
those
are
the
facts
but
so
are
these
in
the
last
months
businesses
have
created
more
than
million
jobs
last
year
they
created
the
most
jobs
since
american
manufacturers
are
hiring
again
creating
jobs
for
the
first
time
since
the
late
together
agreed
to
cut
the
deficit
by
more
than
trillion
dollars
and
put
in
place
new
rules
to
hold
wall
street
accountable
so
crisis
like
this
never
happens
again
the
state
of
our
union
is
getting
stronger
and
come
too
far
to
turn
back
now
as
long
as
president
will
work
with
anyone
in
this
chamber
to
build
on
this
momentum
but
intend
to
fight
obstruction
with
action
and
will
oppose
any
effort
to
return
to
the
very
same
policies
that
brought
on
this
economic
crisis
in
the
first
place
no
we
will
not
go
back
to
an
economy
weakened
by
outsourcing
bad
debt
and
phony
financial
profits
tonight
want
to
speak
about
how
we
move
forward
and
lay
out
blueprint
for
an
economy
built
to
last
an
economy
built
on
american
manufacturing
american
energy
skills
for
american
workers
and
renewal
of
american
values
now
this
blueprint
begins
with
american
manufacturing
on
the
day
took
office
our
auto
industry
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
some
even
said
we
should
let
it
die
with
million
jobs
at
stake
refused
to
let
that
happen
in
exchange
for
help
we
demanded
responsibility
we
got
workers
and
to
settle
their
differences
we
got
the
industry
to
and
restructure
today
general
motors
is
back
on
top
as
the
has
grown
faster
in
the
than
any
major
car
company
ford
is
investing
billions
in
plants
and
factories
and
together
the
entire
industry
added
nearly
jobs
we
bet
on
american
workers
we
bet
on
american
ingenuity
and
tonight
the
american
auto
industry
is
back
happening
in
detroit
can
happen
in
other
industries
it
can
happen
in
and
and
we
bring
every
job
back
left
our
shore
but
right
now
getting
more
expensive
to
do
business
in
places
like
china
meanwhile
america
is
more
productive
few
weeks
ago
the
of
master
lock
told
me
that
it
now
makes
business
sense
for
him
to
bring
jobs
back
home
today
for
the
first
time
in
years
master
plant
in
is
running
at
full
capacity
so
we
have
huge
opportunity
at
this
moment
to
bring
manufacturing
back
but
we
have
to
seize
it
tonight
my
message
to
business
leaders
is
simple
ask
yourselves
what
you
can
do
to
bring
jobs
back
to
your
country
and
your
country
will
do
everything
we
can
to
help
you
succeed
we
should
start
with
our
tax
code
right
now
companies
get
tax
breaks
for
moving
jobs
and
profits
overseas
meanwhile
companies
that
choose
to
stay
in
america
get
hit
with
one
of
the
highest
tax
rates
in
the
world
it
makes
no
sense
and
everyone
knows
it
so
change
it
first
if
business
that
wants
to
jobs
you
get
tax
deduction
for
doing
it
that
money
should
be
used
to
cover
moving
expenses
for
companies
like
master
lock
that
decide
to
bring
jobs
home
second
no
american
company
should
be
able
to
avoid
paying
its
fair
share
of
taxes
by
moving
jobs
and
profits
overseas
from
now
on
every
multinational
company
should
have
to
pay
basic
minimum
tax
and
every
penny
should
go
towards
lowering
taxes
for
companies
that
choose
to
stay
here
and
hire
here
in
america
third
if
an
american
manufacturer
you
should
get
bigger
tax
cut
if
manufacturer
we
should
double
the
tax
deduction
you
get
for
making
your
products
here
and
if
you
want
to
relocate
in
community
that
was
hit
hard
when
factory
left
town
you
should
get
help
financing
new
plant
equipment
or
training
for
new
workers
so
my
message
is
simple
it
is
time
to
stop
rewarding
businesses
that
ship
jobs
overseas
and
start
rewarding
companies
that
create
jobs
right
here
in
america
send
me
these
tax
reforms
and
will
sign
them
right
away
also
making
it
easier
for
american
businesses
to
sell
products
all
over
the
world
two
years
ago
set
goal
of
doubling
exports
over
five
years
with
the
bipartisan
trade
agreements
we
signed
into
law
on
track
to
meet
that
goal
ahead
of
schedule
and
soon
there
will
be
millions
of
new
customers
for
american
goods
in
panama
and
south
korea
soon
there
will
be
new
cars
on
the
streets
of
seoul
imported
from
detroit
and
toledo
and
chicago
will
go
anywhere
in
the
world
to
open
new
markets
for
american
products
and
will
not
stand
by
when
our
competitors
play
by
the
rules
brought
trade
cases
against
china
at
nearly
twice
the
rate
as
the
last
administration
and
made
difference
over
thousand
americans
are
working
today
because
we
stopped
surge
in
chinese
tires
but
we
need
to
do
more
not
right
when
another
country
lets
our
movies
music
and
software
be
pirated
not
fair
when
foreign
manufacturers
have
leg
up
on
ours
only
because
heavily
tonight
announcing
the
creation
of
trade
enforcement
unit
that
will
be
charged
with
investigating
unfair
trading
practices
in
countries
like
china
there
will
be
more
inspections
to
prevent
counterfeit
or
unsafe
goods
from
crossing
our
borders
and
this
congress
should
make
sure
that
no
foreign
company
has
an
advantage
over
american
manufacturing
when
it
comes
to
accessing
financing
or
new
markets
like
russia
our
workers
are
the
most
productive
on
earth
and
if
the
playing
field
is
level
promise
you
america
will
always
win
also
hear
from
many
business
leaders
who
want
to
hire
in
the
united
states
but
find
workers
with
the
right
skills
growing
industries
in
science
and
technology
have
twice
as
many
openings
as
we
have
workers
who
can
do
the
job
think
about
that
openings
at
time
when
millions
of
americans
are
looking
for
work
inexcusable
and
we
know
how
to
fix
it
bray
is
single
mom
from
north
who
was
laid
off
from
her
job
as
mechanic
then
opened
gas
turbine
factory
in
and
formed
partnership
with
central
community
college
the
company
helped
the
college
design
courses
in
laser
and
robotics
training
it
paid
tuition
then
hired
her
to
help
operate
their
plant
want
every
american
looking
for
work
to
have
the
same
opportunity
as
did
join
me
in
national
commitment
to
train
million
americans
with
skills
that
will
lead
directly
to
job
my
administration
has
already
lined
up
more
companies
that
want
to
help
model
partnerships
between
businesses
like
and
community
colleges
in
places
like
and
and
are
up
and
running
now
you
need
to
give
more
community
colleges
the
resources
they
need
to
become
community
career
places
that
teach
people
skills
that
businesses
are
looking
for
right
now
from
data
management
to
manufacturing
and
want
to
cut
through
the
maze
of
confusing
training
programs
so
that
from
now
on
people
like
have
one
program
one
website
and
one
place
to
go
for
all
the
information
and
help
that
they
need
it
is
time
to
turn
our
unemployment
system
into
system
that
puts
people
to
work
these
reforms
will
help
people
get
jobs
that
are
open
today
but
to
prepare
for
the
jobs
of
tomorrow
our
commitment
to
skills
and
education
has
to
start
earlier
for
less
than
percent
of
what
our
nation
spends
on
education
each
year
convinced
nearly
every
state
in
the
country
to
raise
their
standards
for
teaching
and
learning
the
first
time
happened
in
generation
but
challenges
remain
and
we
know
how
to
solve
them
at
time
when
other
countries
are
doubling
down
on
education
tight
budgets
have
forced
states
to
lay
off
thousands
of
teachers
we
know
good
teacher
can
increase
the
lifetime
income
of
classroom
by
over
dollars
great
teacher
can
offer
an
escape
from
poverty
to
the
child
who
dreams
beyond
his
circumstance
every
person
in
this
chamber
can
point
to
teacher
who
changed
the
trajectory
of
their
lives
most
teachers
work
tirelessly
with
modest
pay
sometimes
digging
into
their
own
pocket
for
school
supplies
just
to
make
difference
teachers
matter
so
instead
of
bashing
them
or
defending
the
status
offer
schools
deal
give
them
the
resources
to
keep
good
teachers
on
the
job
and
reward
the
best
ones
and
in
return
grant
schools
flexibility
to
teach
with
creativity
and
passion
to
stop
teaching
to
the
test
and
to
replace
teachers
who
just
helping
kids
learn
bargain
worth
making
we
also
know
that
when
students
walk
away
from
their
education
more
of
them
walk
the
stage
to
get
their
diploma
when
students
are
not
allowed
to
drop
out
they
do
better
so
tonight
am
proposing
that
every
state
every
state
requires
that
all
students
stay
in
high
school
until
they
graduate
or
turn
when
kids
do
graduate
the
most
daunting
challenge
can
be
the
cost
of
college
at
time
when
americans
owe
more
in
tuition
debt
than
credit
card
debt
this
congress
needs
to
stop
the
interest
rates
on
student
loans
from
doubling
in
july
extend
the
tuition
tax
credit
we
started
that
saves
millions
of
families
thousands
of
dollars
and
give
more
young
people
the
chance
to
earn
their
way
through
college
by
doubling
the
number
of
jobs
in
the
next
five
years
of
course
not
enough
for
us
to
increase
student
aid
we
just
keep
tuition
run
out
of
money
states
also
need
to
do
their
part
by
making
higher
education
higher
priority
in
their
budgets
and
colleges
and
universities
have
to
do
their
part
by
working
to
keep
costs
down
recently
spoke
with
group
of
college
presidents
done
just
that
some
schools
redesign
courses
to
help
students
finish
more
quickly
some
use
better
technology
the
point
is
possible
so
let
me
put
colleges
and
universities
on
notice
if
you
stop
tuition
from
going
up
the
funding
you
get
from
taxpayers
will
go
down
higher
education
be
luxury
it
is
an
economic
imperative
that
every
family
in
america
should
be
able
to
afford
also
remember
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
talented
hardworking
students
in
this
country
face
another
challenge
the
fact
that
they
yet
american
citizens
many
were
brought
here
as
small
children
are
american
through
and
through
yet
they
live
every
day
with
the
threat
of
deportation
others
came
more
recently
to
study
business
and
science
and
engineering
but
as
soon
as
they
get
their
degree
we
send
them
home
to
invent
new
products
and
create
new
jobs
somewhere
else
that
make
sense
believe
as
strongly
as
ever
that
we
should
take
on
illegal
immigration
why
my
administration
has
put
more
boots
on
the
border
than
ever
before
why
there
are
fewer
illegal
crossings
than
when
took
office
the
opponents
of
action
are
out
of
excuses
we
should
be
working
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
right
now
but
if
politics
keeps
congress
from
acting
on
comprehensive
plan
at
least
agree
to
stop
expelling
responsible
young
people
who
want
to
staff
our
labs
start
new
businesses
defend
this
country
send
me
law
that
gives
them
the
chance
to
earn
their
citizenship
will
sign
it
right
away
you
see
an
economy
built
to
last
is
one
where
we
encourage
the
talent
and
ingenuity
of
every
person
in
this
country
that
means
women
should
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work
it
means
we
should
support
everyone
willing
to
work
and
every
and
entrepreneur
who
aspires
to
become
the
next
jobs
after
all
innovation
is
what
america
has
always
been
about
most
new
jobs
are
created
in
and
small
businesses
so
pass
an
agenda
that
helps
them
succeed
tear
down
regulations
that
prevent
aspiring
entrepreneurs
from
getting
the
financing
to
grow
expand
tax
relief
to
small
businesses
that
are
raising
wages
and
creating
good
jobs
both
parties
agree
on
these
ideas
so
put
them
in
bill
and
get
it
on
my
desk
this
year
innovation
also
demands
basic
research
today
the
discoveries
taking
place
in
our
federally
financed
labs
and
universities
could
lead
to
new
treatments
that
kill
cancer
cells
but
leave
healthy
ones
untouched
new
lightweight
vests
for
cops
and
soldiers
that
can
stop
any
bullet
gut
these
investments
in
our
budget
let
other
countries
win
the
race
for
the
future
support
the
same
kind
of
research
and
innovation
that
led
to
the
computer
chip
and
the
internet
to
new
american
jobs
and
new
american
industries
and
nowhere
is
the
promise
of
innovation
greater
than
in
energy
over
the
last
three
years
opened
millions
of
new
acres
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
tonight
directing
my
administration
to
open
more
than
percent
of
our
potential
offshore
oil
and
gas
resources
right
now
right
now
american
oil
production
is
the
highest
that
been
in
eight
years
right
eight
years
not
only
that
last
year
we
relied
less
on
foreign
oil
than
in
any
of
the
past
years
but
with
only
percent
of
the
oil
reserves
oil
enough
this
country
needs
an
strategy
that
develops
every
available
source
of
american
energy
strategy
cleaner
cheaper
and
full
of
new
jobs
we
have
supply
of
natural
gas
that
can
last
america
nearly
years
and
my
administration
will
take
every
possible
action
to
safely
develop
this
energy
experts
believe
this
will
support
more
than
jobs
by
the
end
of
the
decade
and
requiring
all
companies
that
drill
for
gas
on
public
lands
to
disclose
the
chemicals
they
use
because
america
will
develop
this
resource
without
putting
the
health
and
safety
of
our
citizens
at
risk
the
development
of
natural
gas
will
create
jobs
and
power
trucks
and
factories
that
are
cleaner
and
cheaper
proving
that
we
have
to
choose
between
our
environment
and
our
economy
and
by
the
way
it
was
public
research
dollars
over
the
course
of
years
that
helped
develop
the
technologies
to
extract
all
this
natural
gas
out
of
shale
rock
reminding
us
that
government
support
is
critical
in
helping
businesses
get
new
energy
ideas
off
the
ground
now
true
for
natural
gas
is
just
as
true
for
clean
energy
in
three
years
our
partnership
with
the
private
sector
has
already
positioned
america
to
be
the
leading
manufacturer
of
batteries
because
of
federal
investments
renewable
energy
use
has
nearly
doubled
and
thousands
of
americans
have
jobs
because
of
it
when
was
laid
off
from
his
job
making
furniture
he
said
he
worried
that
at
no
one
would
give
him
second
chance
but
he
found
work
at
wind
turbine
manufacturer
in
michigan
before
the
recession
the
factory
only
made
luxury
yachts
today
hiring
workers
like
who
said
proud
to
be
working
in
the
industry
of
the
our
experience
with
shale
gas
our
experience
with
natural
gas
shows
us
that
the
on
these
public
investments
always
come
right
away
some
technologies
pan
out
some
companies
fail
but
will
not
walk
away
from
the
promise
of
clean
energy
will
not
walk
away
from
workers
like
will
not
cede
the
wind
or
solar
or
battery
industry
to
china
or
germany
because
we
refuse
to
make
the
same
commitment
here
oil
companies
for
century
long
enough
time
to
end
the
taxpayer
to
an
industry
that
rarely
has
been
more
profitable
and
on
clean
energy
industry
that
never
has
been
more
promising
pass
clean
energy
tax
credits
create
these
jobs
we
can
also
spur
energy
innovation
with
new
incentives
the
differences
in
this
chamber
may
be
too
deep
right
now
to
pass
comprehensive
plan
to
fight
climate
change
but
no
reason
why
congress
at
least
set
clean
energy
standard
that
creates
market
for
innovation
so
far
you
acted
well
tonight
will
directing
my
administration
to
allow
the
development
of
clean
energy
on
enough
public
land
to
power
million
homes
and
proud
to
announce
that
the
department
of
working
with
us
the
largest
consumer
of
energy
will
make
one
of
the
largest
commitments
to
clean
energy
in
history
with
the
navy
purchasing
enough
capacity
to
power
quarter
of
million
homes
year
of
course
the
easiest
way
to
save
money
is
to
waste
less
energy
so
proposal
help
manufacturers
eliminate
energy
waste
in
their
factories
and
give
businesses
incentives
to
upgrade
their
buildings
their
energy
bills
will
be
billion
dollars
lower
over
the
next
decade
and
america
will
have
less
pollution
more
manufacturing
more
jobs
for
construction
workers
who
need
them
send
me
bill
that
creates
these
jobs
building
this
new
energy
future
should
be
just
one
part
of
broader
agenda
to
repair
infrastructure
so
much
of
america
needs
to
be
rebuilt
got
crumbling
roads
and
bridges
power
grid
that
wastes
too
much
energy
an
incomplete
broadband
network
that
prevents
small
business
owner
in
rural
america
from
selling
her
products
all
over
the
world
during
the
great
depression
america
built
the
hoover
dam
and
the
golden
gate
bridge
after
world
war
we
connected
our
states
with
system
of
highways
democratic
and
republican
administrations
invested
in
great
projects
that
benefited
everybody
from
the
workers
who
built
them
to
the
businesses
that
still
use
them
today
in
the
next
few
weeks
will
sign
an
executive
order
clearing
away
the
red
tape
that
slows
down
too
many
construction
projects
but
you
need
to
fund
these
projects
take
the
money
no
longer
spending
at
war
use
half
of
it
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
use
the
rest
to
do
some
right
here
at
home
never
been
better
time
to
build
especially
since
the
construction
industry
was
one
of
the
hardest
hit
when
the
housing
bubble
burst
of
course
construction
workers
the
only
ones
who
were
hurt
so
were
millions
of
innocent
americans
seen
their
home
values
decline
and
while
government
fix
the
problem
on
its
own
responsible
homeowners
have
to
sit
and
wait
for
the
housing
market
to
hit
bottom
to
get
some
relief
and
why
sending
this
congress
plan
that
gives
every
responsible
homeowner
the
chance
to
save
about
dollars
year
on
their
mortgage
by
refinancing
at
historically
low
rates
no
more
red
tape
no
more
from
the
banks
small
fee
on
the
largest
financial
institutions
will
ensure
that
it
add
to
the
deficit
and
will
give
those
banks
that
were
rescued
by
taxpayers
chance
to
repay
deficit
of
trust
never
forget
millions
of
americans
who
work
hard
and
play
by
the
rules
every
day
deserve
government
and
financial
system
that
do
the
same
time
to
apply
the
same
rules
from
top
to
bottom
no
no
handouts
and
no
copouts
an
america
built
to
last
insists
on
responsibility
from
everybody
all
paid
the
price
for
lenders
who
sold
mortgages
to
people
who
afford
them
and
buyers
who
knew
they
afford
them
why
we
need
smart
regulations
to
prevent
irresponsible
rules
to
prevent
financial
fraud
or
toxic
dumping
or
faulty
medical
devices
these
destroy
the
free
market
they
make
the
free
market
work
better
no
question
that
some
regulations
are
outdated
unnecessary
or
too
costly
in
fact
approved
fewer
regulations
in
the
first
three
years
of
my
presidency
than
my
republican
predecessor
did
in
his
ordered
every
federal
agency
to
eliminate
rules
that
make
sense
already
announced
over
reforms
and
just
fraction
of
them
will
save
business
and
citizens
more
than
billion
dollars
over
the
next
five
years
we
got
rid
of
one
rule
from
years
ago
that
could
have
forced
some
dairy
farmers
to
spend
dollars
year
proving
that
they
could
contain
spill
because
milk
was
somehow
classified
as
an
oil
with
rule
like
that
guess
it
was
worth
crying
over
spilled
milk
now
confident
farmer
can
contain
milk
spill
without
federal
agency
looking
over
his
shoulder
absolutely
but
will
not
back
down
from
making
sure
an
oil
company
can
contain
the
kind
of
oil
spill
we
saw
in
the
gulf
two
years
ago
will
not
back
down
from
protecting
our
kids
from
mercury
poisoning
or
making
sure
that
our
food
is
safe
and
our
water
is
clean
will
not
go
back
to
the
days
when
health
insurance
companies
had
unchecked
power
to
cancel
your
policy
deny
your
coverage
or
charge
women
differently
than
men
and
will
not
go
back
to
the
days
when
wall
street
was
allowed
to
play
by
its
own
set
of
rules
the
new
rules
we
passed
restore
what
should
be
any
financial
core
purpose
getting
funding
to
entrepreneurs
with
the
best
ideas
and
getting
loans
to
responsible
families
who
want
to
buy
home
or
start
business
or
send
their
kids
to
college
so
if
you
are
big
bank
or
financial
institution
no
longer
allowed
to
make
risky
bets
with
your
deposits
required
to
write
out
that
details
exactly
how
pay
the
bills
if
you
fail
because
the
rest
of
us
are
not
bailing
you
out
ever
again
and
if
mortgage
lender
or
payday
lender
or
credit
card
company
the
days
of
signing
people
up
for
products
they
afford
with
confusing
forms
and
deceptive
practices
those
days
are
over
today
american
consumers
finally
have
watchdog
in
with
one
job
to
look
out
for
them
also
establish
financial
crimes
unit
of
highly
trained
investigators
to
crack
down
on
fraud
and
protect
investments
some
financial
firms
violate
major
laws
because
no
real
penalty
for
being
repeat
offender
bad
for
consumers
and
bad
for
the
vast
majority
of
bankers
and
financial
service
professionals
who
do
the
right
thing
so
pass
legislation
that
makes
the
penalties
for
fraud
count
and
tonight
asking
my
attorney
general
to
create
special
unit
of
federal
prosecutors
and
leading
state
attorney
general
to
expand
our
investigations
into
the
abusive
lending
and
packaging
of
risky
mortgages
that
led
to
the
housing
crisis
this
new
unit
will
hold
accountable
those
who
broke
the
law
speed
assistance
to
homeowners
and
help
turn
the
page
on
an
era
of
recklessness
that
hurt
so
many
americans
now
return
to
the
american
values
of
fair
play
and
shared
responsibility
will
help
protect
our
people
and
our
economy
but
it
should
also
guide
us
as
we
look
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
invest
in
our
future
right
now
our
most
immediate
priority
is
stopping
tax
hike
on
million
working
americans
while
the
recovery
is
still
fragile
people
can
not
afford
losing
dollars
out
of
each
this
year
there
are
plenty
of
ways
to
get
this
done
so
agree
right
here
right
now
no
side
issues
no
drama
pass
the
payroll
tax
cut
without
delay
get
it
done
when
it
comes
to
the
deficit
already
agreed
to
more
than
trillion
dollars
in
cuts
and
savings
but
we
need
to
do
more
and
that
means
making
choices
right
now
poised
to
spend
nearly
trillion
dollars
more
on
what
was
supposed
to
be
temporary
tax
break
for
the
wealthiest
percent
of
americans
right
now
because
of
loopholes
and
shelters
in
the
tax
code
quarter
of
all
millionaires
pay
lower
tax
rates
than
millions
of
households
right
now
warren
pays
lower
tax
rate
than
his
secretary
do
we
want
to
keep
these
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthiest
americans
or
do
we
want
to
keep
our
investments
in
everything
else
like
education
and
medical
research
strong
military
and
care
for
our
veterans
because
if
serious
about
paying
down
our
debt
we
do
both
the
american
people
know
what
the
right
choice
is
so
do
as
told
the
speaker
this
summer
prepared
to
make
more
reforms
that
rein
in
the
costs
of
and
and
strengthen
social
security
so
long
as
those
programs
remain
guarantee
of
security
for
seniors
but
in
return
we
need
to
change
our
tax
code
so
that
people
like
me
and
an
awful
lot
of
members
of
congress
pay
our
fair
share
of
taxes
tax
reform
should
follow
the
rule
if
you
make
more
than
million
dollars
year
you
should
not
pay
less
than
percent
in
taxes
and
my
republican
friend
is
right
washington
should
stop
millionaires
in
fact
if
earning
million
dollars
year
you
get
special
tax
subsidies
or
deductions
on
the
other
hand
if
you
make
under
dollars
year
like
percent
of
american
families
your
taxes
go
up
the
ones
struggling
with
rising
costs
and
stagnant
wages
the
ones
who
need
relief
now
you
can
call
this
class
warfare
all
you
want
but
asking
billionaire
to
pay
at
least
as
much
as
his
secretary
in
taxes
most
americans
would
call
that
common
sense
we
begrudge
financial
success
in
this
country
we
admire
it
when
americans
talk
about
folks
like
me
paying
my
fair
share
of
taxes
not
because
they
envy
the
rich
because
they
understand
that
when
get
tax
break
need
and
the
country
afford
it
either
adds
to
the
deficit
or
somebody
else
has
to
make
up
the
difference
like
senior
on
fixed
income
or
student
trying
to
get
through
school
or
family
trying
to
make
ends
meet
not
right
americans
know
not
right
they
know
that
this
success
is
only
possible
because
past
generations
felt
responsibility
to
each
other
and
to
the
future
of
their
country
and
they
know
our
way
of
life
will
only
endure
if
we
feel
that
same
sense
of
shared
responsibility
how
reduce
our
deficit
an
america
built
to
last
now
that
people
watching
tonight
have
differing
views
about
taxes
and
debt
energy
and
health
care
but
no
matter
what
party
they
belong
to
bet
most
americans
are
thinking
the
same
thing
right
about
now
nothing
will
get
done
in
washington
this
year
or
next
year
or
maybe
even
the
year
after
that
because
washington
is
broken
can
you
blame
them
for
feeling
little
cynical
the
greatest
blow
to
our
confidence
in
our
economy
last
year
come
from
events
beyond
our
control
it
came
from
debate
in
washington
over
whether
the
united
states
would
pay
its
bills
or
not
who
benefited
from
that
fiasco
talked
tonight
about
the
deficit
of
trust
between
main
street
and
wall
street
but
the
divide
between
this
city
and
the
rest
of
the
country
is
at
least
as
bad
and
it
seems
to
get
worse
every
year
some
of
this
has
to
do
with
the
corrosive
influence
of
money
in
politics
so
together
take
some
steps
to
fix
that
send
me
bill
that
bans
insider
trading
by
members
of
congress
will
sign
it
tomorrow
limit
any
elected
official
from
owning
stocks
in
industries
they
impact
make
sure
people
who
bundle
campaign
contributions
for
congress
lobby
congress
and
vice
an
idea
that
has
bipartisan
support
at
least
outside
of
washington
some
of
broken
has
to
do
with
the
way
congress
does
its
business
these
days
simple
majority
is
no
longer
enough
to
get
anything
even
routine
business
passed
through
the
senate
neither
party
has
been
blameless
in
these
tactics
now
both
parties
should
put
an
end
to
it
for
starters
ask
the
senate
to
pass
simple
rule
that
all
judicial
and
public
service
nominations
receive
simple
up
or
down
vote
within
days
the
executive
branch
also
needs
to
change
too
often
inefficient
outdated
and
remote
why
asked
this
congress
to
grant
me
the
authority
to
consolidate
the
federal
bureaucracy
so
that
our
government
is
leaner
quicker
and
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
american
people
finally
none
of
this
can
happen
unless
we
also
lower
the
temperature
in
this
town
we
need
to
end
the
notion
that
the
two
parties
must
be
locked
in
perpetual
campaign
of
mutual
destruction
that
politics
is
about
clinging
to
rigid
ideologies
instead
of
building
consensus
around
ideas
democrat
but
believe
what
republican
abraham
lincoln
believed
that
government
should
do
for
people
only
what
they
can
not
do
better
by
themselves
and
no
more
why
my
education
reform
offers
more
competition
and
more
control
for
schools
and
states
why
getting
rid
of
regulations
that
work
why
our
health
care
law
relies
on
reformed
private
market
not
government
program
on
the
other
hand
even
my
republican
friends
who
complain
the
most
about
government
spending
have
supported
federally
financed
roads
and
clean
energy
projects
and
federal
offices
for
the
folks
back
home
the
point
is
we
should
all
want
smarter
more
effective
government
and
while
we
may
not
be
able
to
bridge
our
biggest
philosophical
differences
this
year
we
can
make
real
progress
with
or
without
this
congress
will
keep
taking
actions
that
help
the
economy
grow
but
can
do
whole
lot
more
with
your
help
because
when
we
act
together
nothing
the
united
states
of
america
achieve
the
lesson
learned
from
our
actions
abroad
over
the
last
few
years
ending
the
iraq
war
has
allowed
us
to
strike
decisive
blows
against
our
enemies
from
pakistan
to
yemen
the
operatives
who
remain
are
scrambling
knowing
that
they
escape
the
reach
of
the
united
states
of
america
from
this
position
of
strength
begun
to
wind
down
the
war
in
ten
thousand
of
our
troops
have
come
home
thousand
more
will
leave
by
the
end
of
this
summer
this
transition
to
afghan
lead
will
continue
and
we
will
build
an
enduring
partnership
with
so
that
it
is
never
again
source
of
attacks
against
america
as
the
tide
of
war
recedes
wave
of
change
has
washed
across
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
from
to
cairo
from
to
tripoli
year
ago
was
one
of
the
dictators
murderer
with
american
blood
on
his
hands
today
he
is
gone
and
in
syria
have
no
doubt
that
the
regime
will
soon
discover
that
the
forces
of
change
can
not
be
reversed
and
that
human
dignity
can
not
be
denied
how
this
incredible
transformation
will
end
remains
uncertain
but
we
have
huge
stake
in
the
outcome
and
while
ultimately
up
to
the
people
of
the
region
to
decide
their
fate
we
will
advocate
for
those
values
that
have
served
our
own
country
so
well
we
will
stand
against
violence
and
intimidation
we
will
stand
for
the
rights
and
dignity
of
all
human
beings
men
and
women
muslims
and
jews
we
will
support
policies
that
lead
to
strong
and
stable
democracies
and
open
markets
because
tyranny
is
no
match
for
liberty
and
we
will
safeguard
own
security
against
those
who
threaten
our
citizens
our
friends
and
our
interests
look
at
iran
through
the
power
of
our
diplomacy
world
that
was
once
divided
about
how
to
deal
with
nuclear
program
now
stands
as
one
the
regime
is
more
isolated
than
ever
before
its
leaders
are
faced
with
crippling
sanctions
and
as
long
as
they
shirk
their
responsibilities
this
pressure
will
not
relent
let
there
be
no
doubt
america
is
determined
to
prevent
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
will
take
no
options
off
the
table
to
achieve
that
goal
but
peaceful
resolution
of
this
issue
is
still
possible
and
far
better
and
if
iran
changes
course
and
meets
its
obligations
it
can
rejoin
the
community
of
nations
the
renewal
of
american
leadership
can
be
felt
across
the
globe
our
oldest
alliances
in
europe
and
asia
are
stronger
than
ever
our
ties
to
the
are
deeper
our
commitment
and
mean
to
security
has
meant
the
closest
military
cooperation
between
our
two
countries
in
history
made
it
clear
that
america
is
pacific
power
and
new
beginning
in
burma
has
lit
new
hope
from
the
coalitions
built
to
secure
nuclear
materials
to
the
missions
led
against
hunger
and
disease
from
the
blows
dealt
to
our
enemies
to
the
enduring
power
of
our
moral
example
america
is
back
anyone
who
tells
you
otherwise
anyone
who
tells
you
that
america
is
in
decline
or
that
our
influence
has
waned
know
what
talking
about
not
the
message
we
get
from
leaders
around
the
world
who
are
eager
to
work
with
us
not
how
people
feel
from
tokyo
to
berlin
from
cape
town
to
where
opinions
of
america
are
higher
than
been
in
years
yes
the
world
is
changing
no
we
control
every
event
but
america
remains
the
one
indispensable
nation
in
world
affairs
and
as
long
as
president
intend
to
keep
it
that
way
why
working
with
our
military
leaders
proposed
new
strategy
that
ensures
we
maintain
the
finest
military
in
the
world
while
saving
nearly
half
trillion
dollars
in
our
budget
to
stay
one
step
ahead
of
our
adversaries
already
sent
this
congress
legislation
that
will
secure
our
country
from
the
growing
dangers
of
above
all
our
freedom
endures
because
of
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
defend
it
as
they
come
home
we
must
serve
them
as
well
as
served
us
that
includes
giving
them
the
care
and
the
benefits
they
have
earned
which
is
why
increased
annual
spending
every
year
been
president
and
it
means
enlisting
our
veterans
in
the
work
of
rebuilding
our
nation
with
the
bipartisan
support
of
this
congress
providing
new
tax
credits
to
companies
that
hire
vets
and
have
worked
with
american
businesses
to
secure
pledge
of
jobs
for
veterans
and
their
families
and
tonight
proposing
veterans
jobs
corps
that
will
help
our
communities
hire
veterans
as
cops
and
firefighters
so
that
america
is
as
strong
as
those
who
defend
her
which
brings
me
back
to
where
began
those
of
us
been
sent
here
to
serve
can
learn
thing
or
two
from
the
service
of
our
troops
when
you
put
on
that
uniform
it
matter
if
black
or
white
asian
latino
native
american
conservative
liberal
rich
poor
gay
straight
when
marching
into
battle
you
look
out
for
the
person
next
to
you
or
the
mission
fails
when
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
you
rise
or
fall
as
one
unit
serving
one
nation
leaving
no
one
behind
one
of
my
proudest
possessions
is
the
flag
that
the
seal
team
took
with
them
on
the
mission
to
get
bin
laden
on
it
are
each
of
their
names
some
may
be
democrats
some
may
be
republicans
but
that
matter
just
like
it
matter
that
day
in
the
situation
room
when
sat
next
to
bob
gates
man
who
was
george
secretary
and
woman
who
ran
against
me
for
president
all
that
mattered
that
day
was
the
mission
no
one
thought
about
politics
no
one
thought
about
themselves
one
of
the
young
men
involved
in
the
raid
later
told
me
that
he
deserve
credit
for
the
mission
it
only
succeeded
he
said
because
every
single
member
of
that
unit
did
their
job
the
pilot
who
landed
the
helicopter
that
spun
out
of
control
the
translator
who
kept
others
from
entering
the
compound
the
troops
who
separated
the
women
and
children
from
the
fight
the
seals
who
charged
up
the
stairs
more
than
that
the
mission
only
succeeded
because
every
member
of
that
unit
trusted
each
other
because
you
charge
up
those
stairs
into
darkness
and
danger
unless
you
know
that
somebody
behind
you
watching
your
back
so
it
is
with
america
each
time
look
at
that
flag
reminded
that
our
destiny
is
stitched
together
like
those
stars
and
those
stripes
no
one
built
this
country
on
their
own
this
nation
is
great
because
we
built
it
together
this
nation
is
great
because
we
worked
as
team
this
nation
is
great
because
we
get
each
backs
and
if
we
hold
fast
to
that
truth
in
this
moment
of
trial
there
is
no
challenge
too
great
no
mission
too
hard
as
long
as
we
are
joined
in
common
purpose
as
long
as
we
maintain
our
common
resolve
our
journey
moves
forward
and
our
future
is
hopeful
and
the
state
of
our
union
will
always
be
strong
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
morning
everybody
the
united
states
of
america
is
the
greatest
force
for
freedom
and
security
that
the
world
has
ever
known
and
in
no
small
measure
that
because
we
built
the
military
in
history
and
as
going
to
keep
it
that
way
indeed
all
of
us
on
this
stage
every
single
one
of
us
have
profound
responsibility
to
every
soldier
sailor
airman
marine
and
coast
guardsman
who
puts
their
life
on
the
line
for
america
we
owe
them
strategy
with
goals
to
only
send
them
into
harm
way
when
it
absolutely
necessary
to
give
them
the
equipment
and
the
support
that
they
need
to
get
the
job
done
and
to
care
for
them
and
their
families
when
they
come
home
that
is
our
solemn
obligation
and
over
the
past
three
years
that
what
we
done
we
continued
to
make
historic
investments
in
our
military
our
troops
and
their
capabilities
our
military
families
and
our
veterans
and
thanks
to
their
extraordinary
service
we
ended
our
war
in
iraq
we
decimated
leadership
we
delivered
justice
to
bin
laden
and
we
put
that
terrorist
network
on
the
path
to
defeat
we
made
important
progress
in
and
we
begun
to
transition
so
afghans
can
assume
more
responsibility
for
their
own
security
we
joined
allies
and
partners
to
protect
the
libyan
people
as
they
ended
the
regime
of
now
we
turning
the
page
on
decade
of
war
three
years
ago
we
had
some
troops
in
iraq
and
today
we
cut
that
number
in
half
and
as
the
transition
in
continues
more
of
our
troops
will
continue
to
come
home
more
broadly
around
the
globe
we
strengthened
alliances
forged
new
partnerships
and
served
as
force
for
universal
rights
and
human
dignity
in
short
we
succeeded
in
defending
our
nation
taking
the
fight
to
our
enemies
reducing
the
number
of
americans
in
harm
way
and
we
restored
america
global
leadership
that
makes
us
safer
and
it
makes
us
stronger
and
that
an
achievement
that
every
american
especially
those
americans
who
are
proud
to
wear
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
should
take
great
pride
in
this
success
has
brought
our
nation
once
more
to
moment
of
transition
even
as
our
troops
continue
to
fight
in
the
tide
of
war
is
receding
even
as
our
forces
prevail
in
today
missions
we
have
the
opportunity
and
the
responsibility
to
look
ahead
to
the
force
that
we
are
going
to
need
in
the
future
at
the
same
time
we
have
to
renew
our
economic
strength
here
at
home
which
is
the
foundation
of
our
strength
around
the
world
and
that
includes
putting
our
fiscal
house
in
order
to
that
end
the
budget
control
act
passed
by
congress
last
year
with
the
support
of
republicans
and
democrats
alike
mandates
reductions
in
federal
spending
including
spending
insisted
that
we
do
that
responsibly
the
security
of
our
nation
and
the
lives
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
depend
on
it
that
why
called
for
this
comprehensive
review
to
clarify
our
strategic
interests
in
world
and
to
guide
our
priorities
and
spending
over
the
coming
decade
because
the
size
and
the
structure
of
our
military
and
budgets
have
to
be
driven
by
strategy
not
the
other
way
around
moreover
we
have
to
remember
the
lessons
of
history
we
afford
to
repeat
the
mistakes
that
have
been
made
in
the
past
after
world
war
after
when
our
military
was
left
ill
prepared
for
the
future
as
commander
in
chief
will
not
let
that
happen
again
not
on
my
watch
we
need
start
we
need
smart
strategic
set
of
priorities
the
new
guidance
that
the
department
is
releasing
today
does
just
that
want
to
thank
secretary
and
general
for
their
extraordinary
leadership
during
this
process
want
to
thank
the
service
secretaries
and
chiefs
the
combatant
commanders
and
so
many
leaders
military
and
civilian
active
guard
and
reserve
for
their
contributions
many
of
us
met
repeatedly
asking
tough
questions
challenging
our
own
assumptions
and
making
hard
choices
and
we
come
together
today
around
an
approach
that
will
keep
our
nation
safe
and
our
military
the
finest
that
the
world
have
ever
known
this
review
also
benefits
from
the
contributions
of
leaders
from
across
my
national
security
team
from
the
departments
of
state
homeland
security
and
veterans
affairs
as
well
as
the
intelligence
community
and
this
is
critical
because
meeting
the
challenges
of
our
time
can
not
be
the
work
of
our
military
alone
or
the
united
states
alone
it
requires
all
elements
of
our
national
power
working
together
in
concert
with
our
allies
and
our
partners
so
going
to
let
and
go
into
the
details
but
just
want
to
say
that
this
effort
reflects
the
guidance
that
personally
gave
throughout
this
process
yes
the
tide
of
war
is
receding
but
the
question
that
this
strategy
answers
is
what
kind
of
military
will
we
need
long
after
the
wars
of
the
last
decade
are
over
and
today
we
fortunate
to
be
moving
forward
from
position
of
strength
as
made
clear
in
we
will
be
strengthening
our
presence
in
the
asia
pacific
and
budget
reductions
will
not
come
at
the
expense
of
that
critical
region
we
going
to
continue
investing
in
our
critical
partnerships
and
alliances
including
nato
which
has
demonstrated
time
and
again
most
recently
in
libya
that
it
force
multiplier
we
will
stay
vigilant
especially
in
the
middle
east
as
we
look
beyond
the
wars
in
iraq
and
and
the
end
of
with
large
military
footprints
we
be
able
to
ensure
our
security
with
smaller
conventional
ground
forces
we
continue
to
get
rid
of
outdated
cold
systems
so
that
we
can
invest
in
the
capabilities
that
we
need
for
the
future
including
intelligence
surveillance
and
reconnaissance
countering
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
the
ability
to
operate
in
environments
where
adversaries
try
to
deny
us
access
so
yes
our
military
will
be
leaner
but
the
world
must
know
the
united
states
is
going
to
maintain
our
military
superiority
with
armed
forces
that
are
agile
flexible
and
ready
for
the
full
range
of
contingencies
and
threats
we
also
going
to
keep
faith
with
those
who
serve
by
making
sure
our
troops
have
the
equipment
and
capabilities
they
need
to
succeed
and
by
efforts
that
focus
on
wounded
warriors
mental
health
and
the
of
our
military
families
and
as
our
newest
veterans
rejoin
civilian
life
we
keep
working
to
give
our
veterans
the
care
the
benefits
and
job
opportunities
that
they
deserve
and
that
they
have
earned
finally
although
today
is
about
our
strategy
want
to
close
with
word
about
the
budget
that
will
flow
from
this
strategy
the
details
will
be
announced
in
the
coming
weeks
some
will
no
doubt
say
that
the
spending
reductions
are
too
big
others
will
say
that
they
too
small
it
will
be
easy
to
take
issue
with
particular
change
in
particular
program
but
encourage
all
of
us
to
remember
what
president
once
said
that
each
proposal
must
be
weighed
in
the
light
of
broader
consideration
the
need
to
maintain
balance
in
and
among
national
programs
after
decade
of
war
and
as
we
rebuild
the
source
of
our
strength
at
home
and
abroad
it
time
to
restore
that
balance
think
it
important
for
all
americans
to
remember
over
the
past
years
since
our
budget
grew
at
an
extraordinary
pace
over
the
next
years
the
growth
in
the
budget
will
slow
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
it
will
still
grow
because
we
have
global
responsibilities
that
demand
our
leadership
in
fact
the
budget
will
still
be
larger
than
it
was
toward
the
end
of
the
bush
administration
and
firmly
believe
and
think
the
american
people
understand
that
we
can
keep
our
military
strong
and
our
nation
secure
with
budget
that
continues
to
be
larger
than
roughly
the
next
countries
combined
so
again
want
to
thank
secretary
chairman
all
the
leaders
who
are
on
this
stage
and
some
who
are
absent
for
their
leadership
and
their
partnership
throughout
this
process
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
give
their
very
best
to
america
every
single
day
and
in
return
they
deserve
the
very
best
from
america
and
thank
all
of
you
for
the
commitment
to
the
goal
that
we
all
share
keeping
america
strong
and
secure
in
the
century
and
keeping
our
armed
forces
the
very
best
in
the
world
and
with
that
will
turn
this
discussion
over
to
and
to
who
can
explain
more
and
take
your
questions
so
thank
you
very
much
understand
this
is
the
first
time
president
has
done
this
it
pretty
nice
room
thank
you
guys
this
week
marked
historic
moment
in
the
life
of
our
country
and
our
military
for
nearly
nine
years
our
nation
has
been
at
war
in
iraq
more
than
million
americans
have
served
there
with
skill
and
bravery
tens
of
thousands
have
been
wounded
military
families
have
sacrificed
greatly
none
more
so
than
the
families
of
those
nearly
americans
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
all
of
them
our
troops
veterans
and
their
families
will
always
have
the
thanks
of
grateful
nation
on
thursday
the
our
armed
forces
fought
under
in
iraq
were
formally
cased
in
ceremony
in
baghdad
before
beginning
their
journey
back
home
our
troops
are
now
preparing
to
make
their
final
march
across
the
border
and
out
of
the
country
future
will
be
in
the
hands
of
its
own
people
our
war
there
will
be
over
all
of
our
troops
will
be
out
of
iraq
and
this
holiday
season
all
of
us
can
finally
say
welcome
home
this
is
an
extraordinary
achievement
one
made
possible
by
the
hard
work
and
sacrifice
of
the
men
and
women
who
had
the
courage
to
serve
and
lesson
to
learn
from
that
lesson
about
our
character
as
nation
see
reason
our
military
is
the
most
respected
institution
in
america
they
see
themselves
or
each
other
as
democrats
first
or
republicans
first
they
see
themselves
as
americans
first
for
all
our
differences
and
disagreements
they
remind
us
that
we
are
all
part
of
something
bigger
that
we
are
one
nation
and
one
people
and
for
all
our
challenges
they
remind
us
that
there
is
nothing
we
do
when
we
stick
together
the
finest
our
nation
has
to
offer
many
will
remain
in
the
military
and
go
on
to
the
next
mission
others
will
take
off
the
uniform
and
become
veterans
but
their
commitment
to
service
end
when
they
take
off
the
uniform
in
fact
confident
the
story
of
their
service
to
america
is
just
beginning
after
years
of
rebuilding
iraq
it
is
time
to
enlist
our
veterans
and
all
our
people
in
the
work
of
rebuilding
america
folks
like
my
grandfather
came
back
from
world
war
to
form
the
backbone
of
the
largest
middle
class
in
history
and
generation
of
veterans
the
generation
of
veterans
is
armed
with
the
skills
discipline
and
leadership
to
attack
the
defining
challenge
of
our
time
rebuilding
an
economy
where
hard
work
pays
off
where
responsibility
is
rewarded
where
anyone
can
make
it
if
they
try
now
it
is
up
to
us
to
serve
these
brave
men
and
women
as
well
as
they
serve
us
every
day
they
meet
their
responsibilities
to
their
families
and
their
country
now
time
to
meet
ours
especially
those
of
us
who
you
sent
to
serve
in
washington
this
can
not
be
country
where
division
and
discord
stand
in
the
way
of
our
progress
this
is
moment
where
we
must
come
together
to
ensure
that
every
american
has
the
chance
to
work
for
decent
living
own
their
own
home
send
their
kids
to
college
and
secure
decent
retirement
this
is
moment
for
us
to
build
country
that
lives
up
to
the
ideals
that
so
many
of
our
bravest
americans
have
fought
and
even
died
for
that
is
our
highest
obligation
as
citizens
that
is
the
welcome
home
that
our
troops
deserve
thank
you
good
afternoon
everybody
well
want
to
start
by
thanking
few
folks
joined
us
today
got
the
mayor
of
is
here
we
have
your
superintendent
french
in
the
house
and
we
have
the
principal
of
high
and
have
brought
your
former
governor
who
is
doing
now
an
outstanding
job
as
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
is
in
the
house
we
love
well
it
is
great
to
be
back
in
the
state
of
state
of
was
giving
bill
self
hard
time
he
was
here
while
back
as
many
of
you
know
have
roots
here
sure
all
familiar
with
the
of
actually
like
to
say
that
got
my
name
from
my
father
but
got
my
accent
and
my
values
from
my
mother
she
was
born
in
her
mother
grew
up
in
her
father
was
from
dorado
so
my
roots
run
deep
my
grandparents
served
during
world
war
he
was
soldier
in
army
she
was
worker
on
bomber
assembly
line
and
together
they
shared
the
optimism
of
nation
that
triumphed
over
the
great
depression
and
over
fascism
they
believed
in
an
america
where
hard
work
paid
off
and
responsibility
was
rewarded
and
anyone
could
make
it
if
they
tried
no
matter
who
you
were
no
matter
where
you
came
from
no
matter
how
you
started
out
and
these
values
gave
rise
to
the
largest
middle
class
and
the
strongest
economy
that
the
world
has
ever
known
it
was
here
in
america
that
the
most
productive
workers
the
most
innovative
companies
turned
out
the
best
products
on
earth
and
you
know
what
every
american
shared
in
that
pride
and
in
that
success
from
those
in
the
executive
suites
to
those
in
middle
management
to
those
on
the
factory
floor
so
you
could
have
some
confidence
that
if
you
gave
it
your
all
take
enough
home
to
raise
your
family
and
send
your
kids
to
school
and
have
your
health
care
covered
put
little
away
for
retirement
today
still
home
to
the
most
productive
workers
still
home
to
the
most
innovative
companies
but
for
most
americans
the
basic
bargain
that
made
this
country
great
has
eroded
long
before
the
recession
hit
hard
work
stopped
paying
off
for
too
many
people
fewer
and
fewer
of
the
folks
who
contributed
to
the
success
of
our
economy
actually
benefited
from
that
success
those
at
the
very
top
grew
wealthier
from
their
incomes
and
their
investments
wealthier
than
ever
before
but
everybody
else
struggled
with
costs
that
were
growing
and
that
and
too
many
families
found
themselves
racking
up
more
and
more
debt
just
to
keep
up
now
for
many
years
credit
cards
and
home
equity
loans
papered
over
this
harsh
reality
but
in
the
house
of
cards
collapsed
we
all
know
the
story
by
now
mortgages
sold
to
people
who
afford
them
or
even
sometimes
understand
them
banks
and
investors
allowed
to
keep
packaging
the
risk
and
selling
it
off
huge
bets
and
huge
bonuses
made
with
other
money
on
the
line
regulators
who
were
supposed
to
warn
us
about
the
dangers
of
all
this
but
looked
the
other
way
or
have
the
authority
to
look
at
all
it
was
wrong
it
combined
the
breathtaking
greed
of
few
with
irresponsibility
all
across
the
system
and
it
plunged
our
economy
and
the
world
into
crisis
from
which
still
fighting
to
recover
it
claimed
the
jobs
and
the
homes
and
the
basic
security
of
millions
of
people
innocent
hardworking
americans
who
had
met
their
responsibilities
but
were
still
left
holding
the
bag
and
ever
since
been
raging
debate
over
the
best
way
to
restore
growth
and
prosperity
restore
balance
restore
fairness
throughout
the
country
sparked
protests
and
political
movements
from
the
tea
party
to
the
people
been
occupying
the
streets
of
new
york
and
other
cities
left
washington
in
state
of
gridlock
been
the
topic
of
heated
and
sometimes
discussion
among
the
men
and
women
running
for
president
but
this
is
not
just
another
political
debate
this
is
the
defining
issue
of
our
time
this
is
moment
for
the
middle
class
and
for
all
those
who
are
fighting
to
get
into
the
middle
class
because
at
stake
is
whether
this
will
be
country
where
working
people
can
earn
enough
to
raise
family
build
modest
savings
own
home
secure
their
retirement
now
in
the
midst
of
this
debate
there
are
some
who
seem
to
be
suffering
from
kind
of
collective
amnesia
after
all
happened
after
the
worst
economic
crisis
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression
they
want
to
return
to
the
same
practices
that
got
us
into
this
mess
in
fact
they
want
to
go
back
to
the
same
policies
that
stacked
the
deck
against
americans
for
way
too
many
years
and
their
philosophy
is
simple
we
are
better
off
when
everybody
is
left
to
fend
for
themselves
and
play
by
their
own
rules
am
here
to
say
they
are
wrong
here
in
to
reaffirm
my
deep
conviction
that
greater
together
than
we
are
on
our
own
believe
that
this
country
succeeds
when
everyone
gets
fair
shot
when
everyone
does
their
fair
share
when
everyone
plays
by
the
same
rules
these
democratic
values
or
republican
values
these
percent
values
or
percent
values
american
values
and
we
have
to
reclaim
them
you
see
this
the
first
time
america
has
faced
this
choice
at
the
turn
of
the
last
century
when
nation
of
farmers
was
to
become
the
industrial
giant
we
had
to
decide
would
we
settle
for
country
where
most
of
the
new
and
factories
were
being
controlled
by
few
giant
monopolies
that
kept
prices
high
and
wages
low
would
we
allow
our
citizens
and
even
our
children
to
work
ungodly
hours
in
conditions
that
were
unsafe
and
unsanitary
would
we
restrict
education
to
the
privileged
few
because
there
were
people
who
thought
massive
inequality
and
exploitation
of
people
was
just
the
price
you
pay
for
progress
disagreed
he
was
the
republican
son
of
wealthy
family
he
praised
what
the
titans
of
industry
had
done
to
create
jobs
and
grow
the
economy
he
believed
then
what
we
know
is
true
today
that
the
free
market
is
the
greatest
force
for
economic
progress
in
human
history
led
to
prosperity
and
standard
of
living
unmatched
by
the
rest
of
the
world
but
also
knew
that
the
free
market
has
never
been
free
license
to
take
whatever
you
can
from
whomever
you
can
he
understood
the
free
market
only
works
when
there
are
rules
of
the
road
that
ensure
competition
is
fair
and
open
and
honest
and
so
he
busted
up
monopolies
forcing
those
companies
to
compete
for
consumers
with
better
services
and
better
prices
and
today
they
still
must
he
fought
to
make
sure
businesses
profit
by
exploiting
children
or
selling
food
or
medicine
that
safe
and
today
they
still
and
in
teddy
came
here
to
and
he
laid
out
his
vision
for
what
he
called
new
nationalism
country
he
said
nothing
unless
it
means
the
triumph
of
real
an
economic
system
under
which
each
man
shall
be
guaranteed
the
opportunity
to
show
the
best
that
there
is
in
now
for
this
was
called
radical
he
was
called
socialist
even
communist
but
today
we
are
richer
nation
and
stronger
democracy
because
of
what
he
fought
for
in
his
last
campaign
an
work
day
and
minimum
wage
for
women
insurance
for
the
unemployed
and
for
the
elderly
and
those
with
disabilities
political
reform
and
progressive
income
tax
today
over
years
later
our
economy
has
gone
through
another
transformation
over
the
last
few
decades
huge
advances
in
technology
have
allowed
businesses
to
do
more
with
less
and
made
it
easier
for
them
to
set
up
shop
and
hire
workers
anywhere
they
want
in
the
world
and
many
of
you
know
firsthand
the
painful
disruptions
this
has
caused
for
lot
of
americans
factories
where
people
thought
they
would
retire
suddenly
picked
up
and
went
overseas
where
workers
were
cheaper
steel
mills
that
needed
or
employees
are
now
able
to
do
the
same
work
with
employees
so
layoffs
too
often
became
permanent
not
just
temporary
part
of
the
business
cycle
and
these
changes
just
affect
workers
if
you
were
bank
teller
or
phone
operator
or
travel
agent
you
saw
many
in
your
profession
replaced
by
and
the
internet
today
even
jobs
like
accountants
and
middle
management
can
be
to
countries
like
china
or
india
and
if
somebody
whose
job
can
be
done
cheaper
by
computer
or
someone
in
another
country
you
have
lot
of
leverage
with
your
employer
when
it
comes
to
asking
for
better
wages
or
better
benefits
especially
since
fewer
americans
today
are
part
of
union
now
just
as
there
was
in
teddy
time
there
is
certain
crowd
in
washington
who
for
the
last
few
decades
have
said
respond
to
this
economic
challenge
with
the
same
old
tune
market
will
take
care
of
everything
they
tell
us
if
we
just
cut
more
regulations
and
cut
more
taxes
especially
for
the
wealthy
our
economy
will
grow
stronger
sure
they
say
there
will
be
winners
and
losers
but
if
the
winners
do
really
well
then
jobs
and
prosperity
will
eventually
trickle
down
to
everybody
else
and
they
argue
even
if
prosperity
trickle
down
well
the
price
of
liberty
now
simple
theory
and
we
have
to
admit
one
that
speaks
to
our
rugged
individualism
and
our
healthy
of
too
much
government
in
and
that
theory
fits
well
on
bumper
sticker
but
the
problem
it
work
it
has
never
worked
it
work
when
it
was
tried
in
the
decade
before
the
great
depression
not
what
led
to
the
incredible
booms
of
the
and
and
it
work
when
we
tried
it
during
the
last
decade
mean
understand
not
as
if
we
tried
this
theory
remember
in
those
years
in
and
congress
passed
two
of
the
most
expensive
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
in
history
and
what
did
it
get
us
the
slowest
job
growth
in
half
century
massive
deficits
that
have
made
it
much
harder
to
pay
for
the
investments
that
built
this
country
and
provided
the
basic
security
that
helped
millions
of
americans
reach
and
stay
in
the
middle
class
things
like
education
and
infrastructure
science
and
technology
and
social
security
remember
that
in
those
same
years
thanks
to
some
of
the
same
folks
who
are
now
running
congress
we
had
weak
regulation
we
had
little
oversight
and
what
did
it
get
us
insurance
companies
that
jacked
up
premiums
with
impunity
and
denied
care
to
patients
who
were
sick
mortgage
lenders
that
tricked
families
into
buying
homes
they
afford
financial
sector
where
irresponsibility
and
lack
of
basic
oversight
nearly
destroyed
our
entire
economy
we
simply
can
not
return
to
this
brand
of
on
your
economics
if
serious
about
rebuilding
the
middle
class
in
this
country
we
know
that
it
result
in
strong
economy
it
results
in
an
economy
that
invests
too
little
in
its
people
and
in
its
future
we
know
it
result
in
prosperity
that
trickles
down
it
results
in
prosperity
enjoyed
by
fewer
and
fewer
of
our
citizens
look
at
the
statistics
in
the
last
few
decades
the
average
income
of
the
top
percent
has
gone
up
by
more
than
percent
to
million
dollars
per
year
not
talking
about
millionaires
people
who
have
million
dollars
saying
people
who
make
million
dollars
every
single
year
for
the
top
one
hundredth
of
percent
the
average
income
is
now
million
dollars
per
year
the
typical
who
used
to
earn
about
times
more
than
his
or
her
worker
now
earns
times
more
and
yet
over
the
last
decade
the
incomes
of
most
americans
have
actually
fallen
by
about
percent
now
this
kind
of
inequality
level
that
we
seen
since
the
great
depression
hurts
us
all
when
families
can
no
longer
afford
to
buy
the
goods
and
services
that
businesses
are
selling
when
people
are
slipping
out
of
the
middle
class
it
drags
down
the
entire
economy
from
top
to
bottom
america
was
built
on
the
idea
of
prosperity
of
strong
consumers
all
across
the
country
why
like
henry
ford
made
it
his
mission
to
pay
his
workers
enough
so
that
they
could
buy
the
cars
he
made
also
why
recent
study
showed
that
countries
with
less
inequality
tend
to
have
stronger
and
steadier
economic
growth
over
the
long
run
inequality
also
distorts
our
democracy
it
gives
an
voice
to
the
few
who
can
afford
lobbyists
and
unlimited
campaign
contributions
and
it
runs
the
risk
of
selling
out
our
democracy
to
the
highest
bidder
it
leaves
everyone
else
rightly
suspicious
that
the
system
in
washington
is
rigged
against
them
that
our
elected
representatives
looking
out
for
the
interests
of
most
americans
but
an
even
more
fundamental
issue
at
stake
this
kind
of
gaping
inequality
gives
lie
to
the
promise
at
the
very
heart
of
america
that
this
is
place
where
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
we
tell
people
we
tell
our
kids
that
in
this
country
even
if
born
with
nothing
work
hard
and
you
can
get
into
the
middle
class
we
tell
them
that
your
children
will
have
chance
to
do
even
better
than
you
do
why
immigrants
from
around
the
world
historically
have
flocked
to
our
shores
and
yet
over
the
last
few
decades
the
rungs
on
the
ladder
of
opportunity
have
grown
farther
and
farther
apart
and
the
middle
class
has
shrunk
you
know
few
years
after
world
war
child
who
was
born
into
poverty
had
slightly
better
than
chance
of
becoming
middle
class
as
an
adult
by
that
chance
had
fallen
to
around
percent
and
if
the
trend
of
rising
inequality
over
the
last
few
decades
continues
estimated
that
child
born
today
will
only
have
chance
of
making
it
to
the
middle
class
percent
heartbreaking
enough
that
there
are
millions
of
working
families
in
this
country
who
are
now
forced
to
take
their
children
to
food
banks
for
decent
meal
but
the
idea
that
those
children
might
not
have
chance
to
climb
out
of
that
situation
and
back
into
the
middle
class
no
matter
how
hard
they
work
inexcusable
it
is
wrong
it
flies
in
the
face
of
everything
that
we
stand
for
now
fortunately
not
future
that
we
have
to
accept
because
another
view
about
how
we
build
strong
middle
class
in
this
country
view
truer
to
our
history
vision
been
embraced
in
the
past
by
people
of
both
parties
for
more
than
years
not
view
that
we
should
somehow
turn
back
technology
or
put
up
walls
around
america
not
view
that
says
we
should
punish
profit
or
success
or
pretend
that
government
knows
how
to
fix
all
of
problems
it
is
view
that
says
in
america
we
are
greater
together
when
everyone
engages
in
fair
play
and
everybody
gets
fair
shot
and
everybody
does
their
fair
share
so
what
does
that
mean
for
restoring
security
in
economy
well
it
starts
by
making
sure
that
everyone
in
america
gets
fair
shot
at
success
the
truth
is
never
be
able
to
compete
with
other
countries
when
it
comes
to
best
at
letting
their
businesses
pay
the
lowest
wages
best
at
busting
unions
best
at
letting
companies
pollute
as
much
as
they
want
race
to
the
bottom
that
we
win
and
we
want
to
win
that
race
those
countries
have
strong
middle
class
they
have
our
standard
of
living
the
race
we
want
to
win
the
race
we
can
win
is
race
to
the
top
the
race
for
good
jobs
that
pay
well
and
offer
security
businesses
will
create
those
jobs
in
countries
with
the
workers
the
most
advanced
transportation
and
communication
the
strongest
commitment
to
research
and
technology
the
world
is
shifting
to
an
innovation
economy
and
nobody
does
innovation
better
than
america
nobody
does
it
better
no
one
has
better
colleges
nobody
has
better
universities
nobody
has
greater
diversity
of
talent
and
ingenuity
no
workers
or
entrepreneurs
are
more
driven
or
more
daring
the
things
that
have
always
been
our
strengths
match
up
perfectly
with
the
demands
of
the
moment
but
we
need
to
meet
the
moment
got
to
up
our
game
we
need
to
remember
that
we
can
only
do
that
together
it
starts
by
making
education
national
mission
national
mission
government
and
businesses
parents
and
citizens
in
this
economy
higher
education
is
the
surest
route
to
the
middle
class
the
unemployment
rate
for
americans
with
college
degree
or
more
is
about
half
the
national
average
and
their
incomes
are
twice
as
high
as
those
who
have
high
school
diploma
which
means
we
be
laying
off
good
teachers
right
now
we
should
be
hiring
them
we
be
expecting
less
of
our
schools
we
should
be
demanding
more
we
be
making
it
harder
to
afford
college
we
should
be
country
where
everyone
has
chance
to
go
and
rack
up
of
debt
just
because
they
went
in
innovation
economy
we
also
need
commitment
to
science
and
research
the
next
generation
of
manufacturing
our
factories
and
our
workers
be
idle
we
should
be
giving
people
the
chance
to
get
new
skills
and
training
at
community
colleges
so
they
can
learn
how
to
make
wind
turbines
and
semiconductors
and
batteries
and
by
the
way
if
we
have
an
economy
built
on
bubbles
and
financial
speculation
our
best
and
brightest
all
gravitate
towards
careers
in
banking
and
finance
because
if
we
want
an
economy
built
to
last
we
need
more
of
those
young
people
in
science
and
engineering
this
country
should
not
be
known
for
bad
debt
and
phony
profits
we
should
be
known
for
creating
and
selling
products
all
around
the
world
that
are
stamped
with
three
proud
words
made
in
america
today
manufacturers
and
other
companies
are
setting
up
shop
in
the
places
with
the
best
infrastructure
to
ship
their
products
move
their
workers
communicate
with
the
rest
of
the
world
and
why
the
over
million
construction
workers
who
lost
their
jobs
when
the
housing
market
collapsed
they
be
sitting
at
home
with
nothing
to
do
they
should
be
rebuilding
our
roads
and
our
bridges
laying
down
faster
and
broadband
our
schools
all
the
things
other
countries
are
already
doing
to
attract
good
jobs
and
businesses
to
their
shores
yes
business
and
not
government
will
always
be
the
primary
generator
of
good
jobs
with
incomes
that
lift
people
into
the
middle
class
and
keep
them
there
but
as
nation
always
come
together
through
our
government
to
help
create
the
conditions
where
both
workers
and
businesses
can
succeed
and
historically
that
been
partisan
idea
worked
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
give
veterans
of
world
war
including
my
grandfather
the
chance
to
go
to
college
on
the
bill
it
was
republican
president
proud
son
of
who
started
the
highway
system
and
doubled
down
on
science
and
research
to
stay
ahead
of
the
of
course
those
productive
investments
cost
money
not
free
and
so
also
paid
for
these
investments
by
asking
everybody
to
do
their
fair
share
look
if
we
had
unlimited
resources
no
one
would
ever
have
to
pay
any
taxes
and
we
would
never
have
to
cut
any
spending
but
we
have
unlimited
resources
and
so
we
have
to
set
priorities
if
we
want
strong
middle
class
then
our
tax
code
must
reflect
our
values
we
have
to
make
choices
today
that
choice
is
very
clear
to
reduce
our
deficit
already
signed
nearly
trillion
of
spending
cuts
into
law
and
proposed
trillions
more
including
reforms
that
would
lower
the
cost
of
and
but
in
order
to
structurally
close
the
deficit
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
we
have
to
decide
what
our
priorities
are
now
most
immediately
short
term
we
need
to
extend
payroll
tax
cut
set
to
expire
at
the
end
of
this
month
if
we
do
that
million
americans
including
most
of
the
people
here
will
see
their
taxes
go
up
by
an
average
of
starting
in
january
and
it
would
badly
weaken
our
recovery
the
short
term
in
the
long
term
we
have
to
rethink
our
tax
system
more
fundamentally
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
do
we
want
to
make
the
investments
we
need
in
things
like
education
and
research
and
manufacturing
all
those
things
that
helped
make
us
an
economic
superpower
or
do
we
want
to
keep
in
place
the
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthiest
americans
in
our
country
because
we
afford
to
do
both
that
is
not
politics
just
math
now
so
far
most
of
my
republican
friends
in
washington
have
refused
under
any
circumstance
to
ask
the
wealthiest
americans
to
go
to
the
same
tax
rate
they
were
paying
when
bill
was
president
so
just
do
trip
down
memory
lane
here
keep
in
mind
when
president
first
proposed
these
tax
increases
folks
in
congress
predicted
they
would
kill
jobs
and
lead
to
another
recession
instead
our
economy
created
nearly
million
jobs
and
we
eliminated
the
deficit
today
the
wealthiest
americans
are
paying
the
lowest
taxes
in
over
half
century
this
like
in
the
early
when
the
top
tax
rate
was
over
percent
this
even
like
the
early
when
the
top
tax
rate
was
about
percent
under
president
the
top
rate
was
only
about
percent
today
thanks
to
loopholes
and
shelters
quarter
of
all
millionaires
now
pay
lower
tax
rates
than
millions
of
you
millions
of
families
some
billionaires
have
tax
rate
as
low
as
percent
one
percent
that
is
the
height
of
unfairness
it
is
wrong
wrong
that
in
the
united
states
of
america
teacher
or
nurse
or
construction
worker
maybe
earns
year
should
pay
higher
tax
rate
than
somebody
raking
in
million
wrong
for
warren
secretary
to
pay
higher
tax
rate
than
warren
and
by
the
way
warren
agrees
with
me
so
do
most
americans
democrats
independents
and
republicans
and
know
that
many
of
our
wealthiest
citizens
would
agree
to
contribute
little
more
if
it
meant
reducing
the
deficit
and
strengthening
the
economy
that
made
their
success
possible
this
about
class
warfare
this
is
about
the
welfare
about
making
choices
that
benefit
not
just
the
people
done
well
over
the
last
few
decades
but
that
benefits
the
middle
class
and
those
fighting
to
get
into
the
middle
class
and
the
economy
as
whole
finally
strong
middle
class
can
only
exist
in
an
economy
where
everyone
plays
by
the
same
rules
from
wall
street
to
main
street
as
infuriating
as
it
was
for
all
of
us
we
rescued
our
major
banks
from
collapse
not
only
because
financial
meltdown
would
have
sent
us
into
second
depression
but
because
we
need
strong
healthy
financial
sector
in
this
country
but
part
of
the
deal
was
that
we
go
back
to
business
as
usual
and
why
last
year
we
put
in
place
new
rules
of
the
road
that
refocus
the
financial
sector
on
what
should
be
their
core
purpose
getting
capital
to
the
entrepreneurs
with
the
best
ideas
and
financing
millions
of
families
who
want
to
buy
home
or
send
their
kids
to
college
now
not
all
the
way
there
yet
and
the
banks
are
fighting
us
every
inch
of
the
way
but
already
some
of
these
reforms
are
being
implemented
if
big
bank
or
risky
financial
institution
you
now
have
to
write
out
that
details
exactly
how
pay
the
bills
if
you
fail
so
that
taxpayers
are
never
again
on
the
hook
for
wall
mistakes
there
are
also
limits
on
the
size
of
banks
and
new
abilities
for
regulators
to
dismantle
firm
that
is
going
under
the
new
law
bans
banks
from
making
risky
bets
with
their
deposits
and
it
takes
away
big
bonuses
and
paydays
from
failed
while
giving
shareholders
say
on
executive
salaries
this
is
the
law
that
we
passed
we
are
in
the
process
of
implementing
it
now
all
of
this
is
being
put
in
place
as
we
speak
now
unless
financial
institution
whose
business
model
is
built
on
breaking
the
law
cheating
consumers
and
making
risky
bets
that
could
damage
the
entire
economy
you
should
have
nothing
to
fear
from
these
new
rules
some
of
you
may
know
my
grandmother
worked
as
banker
for
most
of
her
life
worked
her
way
up
started
as
secretary
ended
up
being
vice
president
of
bank
and
know
from
her
and
know
from
all
the
people
that
come
in
contact
with
that
the
vast
majority
of
bankers
and
financial
service
professionals
they
want
to
do
right
by
their
customers
they
want
to
have
rules
in
place
that
put
them
at
disadvantage
for
doing
the
right
thing
and
yet
republicans
in
congress
are
fighting
as
hard
as
they
can
to
make
sure
that
these
rules
enforced
give
you
specific
example
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
reforms
that
we
passed
put
in
place
consumer
watchdog
who
is
charged
with
protecting
everyday
americans
from
being
taken
advantage
of
by
mortgage
lenders
or
payday
lenders
or
debt
collectors
and
the
man
we
nominated
for
the
post
is
former
attorney
general
of
ohio
who
has
the
support
of
most
attorney
generals
both
democrat
and
republican
throughout
the
country
nobody
claims
not
qualified
but
the
republicans
in
the
senate
refuse
to
confirm
him
for
the
job
they
refuse
to
let
him
do
his
job
why
does
anybody
here
think
that
the
problem
that
led
to
our
financial
crisis
was
too
much
oversight
of
mortgage
lenders
or
debt
collectors
of
course
not
every
day
we
go
without
consumer
watchdog
is
another
day
when
student
or
senior
citizen
or
member
of
our
armed
forces
because
they
are
very
vulnerable
to
some
of
this
stuff
could
be
tricked
into
loan
that
they
afford
something
that
happens
all
the
time
and
the
fact
is
that
financial
institutions
have
plenty
of
lobbyists
looking
out
for
their
interests
consumers
deserve
to
have
someone
whose
job
it
is
to
look
out
for
them
and
intend
to
make
sure
they
do
and
want
you
to
hear
me
will
veto
any
effort
to
delay
or
or
dismantle
the
new
rules
that
we
put
in
place
we
be
weakening
oversight
and
accountability
we
should
be
strengthening
oversight
and
accountability
give
you
another
example
too
often
seen
wall
street
firms
violating
major
laws
because
the
penalties
are
too
weak
and
no
price
for
being
repeat
offender
no
more
be
calling
for
legislation
that
makes
those
penalties
count
so
that
firms
see
punishment
for
breaking
the
law
as
just
the
price
of
doing
business
the
fact
is
this
crisis
has
left
huge
deficit
of
trust
between
main
street
and
wall
street
and
major
banks
that
were
rescued
by
the
taxpayers
have
an
obligation
to
go
the
extra
mile
in
helping
to
close
that
deficit
of
trust
at
minimum
they
should
be
remedying
past
mortgage
abuses
that
led
to
the
financial
crisis
they
should
be
working
to
keep
responsible
homeowners
in
their
home
going
to
keep
pushing
them
to
provide
more
time
for
unemployed
homeowners
to
look
for
work
without
having
to
worry
about
immediately
losing
their
house
the
big
banks
should
increase
access
to
refinancing
opportunities
to
borrowers
who
yet
benefited
from
historically
low
interest
rates
and
the
big
banks
should
that
precisely
because
these
steps
are
in
the
interest
of
families
and
the
broader
economy
it
will
also
be
in
the
own
financial
interest
what
will
be
good
for
consumers
over
the
long
term
will
be
good
for
the
banks
investing
in
things
like
education
that
give
everybody
chance
to
succeed
tax
code
that
makes
sure
everybody
pays
their
fair
share
and
laws
that
make
sure
everybody
follows
the
rules
what
will
transform
our
economy
what
will
grow
our
middle
class
again
in
the
end
rebuilding
this
economy
based
on
fair
play
fair
shot
and
fair
share
will
require
all
of
us
to
see
that
we
have
stake
in
each
success
and
it
will
require
all
of
us
to
take
some
responsibility
it
will
require
parents
to
get
more
involved
in
their
education
it
will
require
students
to
study
harder
it
will
require
some
workers
to
start
studying
all
over
again
it
will
require
greater
responsibility
from
homeowners
not
to
take
out
mortgages
they
afford
they
need
to
remember
that
if
something
seems
too
good
to
be
true
it
probably
is
it
will
require
those
of
us
in
public
service
to
make
government
more
efficient
and
more
effective
more
more
responsive
to
needs
why
cutting
programs
that
we
need
to
pay
for
those
we
do
why
made
hundreds
of
regulatory
reforms
that
will
save
businesses
billions
of
dollars
why
not
just
throwing
money
at
education
challenging
schools
to
come
up
with
the
most
innovative
reforms
and
the
best
results
and
it
will
require
american
business
leaders
to
understand
that
their
obligations
just
end
with
their
shareholders
grove
the
legendary
former
of
put
it
best
he
said
is
another
obligation
feel
personally
given
that
everything
achieved
in
my
career
and
lot
of
what
has
made
possible
by
climate
of
democracy
an
economic
climate
and
investment
climate
provided
by
the
united
this
broader
obligation
can
take
many
forms
at
time
when
the
cost
of
hiring
workers
in
china
is
rising
rapidly
it
should
mean
more
deciding
that
time
to
bring
jobs
back
to
the
united
states
not
just
because
good
for
business
but
because
good
for
the
country
that
made
their
business
and
their
personal
success
possible
think
about
the
big
three
auto
companies
who
during
recent
negotiations
agreed
to
create
more
jobs
and
cars
here
in
america
and
then
decided
to
give
bonuses
not
just
to
their
executives
but
to
all
their
employees
so
that
everyone
was
invested
in
the
success
think
about
company
based
in
called
windows
and
doors
during
the
recession
competitors
closed
dozens
of
plants
let
hundreds
of
workers
go
but
did
not
lay
off
single
one
of
their
or
so
employees
not
one
in
fact
only
laid
off
workers
once
in
over
hundred
years
grandfather
even
kept
his
eight
employees
during
the
great
depression
now
at
when
times
get
tough
the
workers
agree
to
give
up
some
perks
and
some
pay
and
so
do
the
owners
as
one
owner
said
grow
if
cutting
your
lifeblood
and
the
skills
and
experience
your
workforce
for
the
of
about
the
community
he
said
are
people
we
went
to
school
with
we
go
to
church
with
them
we
see
them
in
the
same
restaurants
indeed
lot
of
us
have
married
local
girls
and
boys
we
could
be
anywhere
but
we
are
in
how
america
was
built
why
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
what
our
greatest
companies
understand
our
success
has
never
just
been
about
survival
of
the
fittest
about
building
nation
where
all
better
off
we
pull
together
we
pitch
in
we
do
our
part
we
believe
that
hard
work
will
pay
off
that
responsibility
will
be
rewarded
and
that
our
children
will
inherit
nation
where
those
values
live
on
and
it
is
that
belief
that
rallied
thousands
of
americans
to
maybe
even
some
of
your
ancestors
on
day
more
than
century
ago
by
train
by
wagon
on
buggy
bicycle
on
foot
they
came
to
hear
the
vision
of
man
who
loved
this
country
and
was
determined
to
perfect
it
are
all
americans
teddy
told
them
that
day
common
interests
are
as
broad
as
the
in
the
final
years
of
his
life
took
that
same
message
all
across
this
country
from
tiny
to
the
heart
of
new
york
city
believing
that
no
matter
where
he
went
no
matter
who
he
was
talking
to
everybody
would
benefit
from
country
in
which
everyone
gets
fair
chance
and
well
into
our
third
century
as
nation
we
have
grown
and
changed
in
many
ways
since
time
the
world
is
faster
and
the
playing
field
is
larger
and
the
challenges
are
more
complex
but
what
changed
what
can
never
change
are
the
values
that
got
us
this
far
we
still
have
stake
in
each
success
we
still
believe
that
this
should
be
place
where
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
and
we
still
believe
in
the
words
of
the
man
who
called
for
new
nationalism
all
those
years
ago
fundamental
rule
of
our
national
life
he
said
rule
which
underlies
all
others
is
that
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
we
shall
go
up
or
down
and
believe
america
is
on
the
way
up
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
so

this
conference
the
most
successful
yet
want
to
acknowledge
outstanding
members
of
my
team
that
have
helped
pull
this
together
but
more
importantly
day
in
and
day
out
are
thinking
about
what
we
can
do
to
make
sure
that
all
the
tribes
that
are
represented
have
voice
here
in
washington
first
of

of
you

we
also
have
members
of

as
well
who
are
great
partners
in
this
effort
and
finally
want
to
give
to
the
young
people
who
are
here
as
part
of
the
white
house
program
called
for
really
remarkable
young
people
had
chance
to
meet
them
backstage
working
to
prevent
teen
suicide
among
alaska
natives
thomas
who
bringing
green
jobs
to
the
nation
dallas
who
started
gardening
club
to
promote
healthy
eating
in
washington
she
wrote
goal
is
not
to
be
couch
but
to
grow
some
think
would
like
that
one
standing
in
this
room
with
leaders
of
all
ages
impossible
not
to
be
optimistic
about
the
future
of
indian
country
obviously
we
face
tough
times
but
you
still
believe
that
tomorrow
can
be
better
than
today
out
there
making
your
communities
better
places
to
live
what
you
expect
and
what
you
deserve
is
federal
government
that
helps
not
hinders
your
efforts
you
deserve
leaders
in
washington
who
fight
for
you
every
single
day
one
of
the
reasons
ran
for
this
office
when
visited
the
crow
nation
during
the
campaign
said
my
job
was
not
just
to
win
an
election
it
was
to
make
sure
that
washington
starts
focusing
on
you
promised
true
relationship
relationship
that
our
sometimes
painful
history
relationship
that
respects
the
unique
heritage
of
native
americans
and
that
includes
you
in
the
dream
that
we
all
share
and
together
we
building
that
relationship
told
you
would
bring
tribal
leaders
to
washington
to
reflect
to
develop
an
agenda
that
reflects
your
hopes
and
your
concerns
and
now
for
third
year
in
row
we
have
kept
that
promise
told
you
that
when
was
president
we
just
pay
lip
service
to
the
idea
of
consultation
and
today
we
holding
every
cabinet
agency
responsible
for
working
together
with
indian
tribes
told
you
appoint
native
americans
to
senior
positions
in
the
white
house
and
know
that
many
of
you
have
worked
with
teehee
of
nation
my
senior
policy
for
native
american
issues
and
charlie
of
the
nation
in
our
office
of
intergovernmental
affairs
working
to
make
our
relationship
even
stronger
we
asked
congress
to
the
power
of
tribes
to
prosecute
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
whether
indian
or
and
in
the
wake
of
the
decision
we
asked
congress
to
restore
the
secretary
of
the
authority
to
take
land
into
trust
for
federally
indian
tribes
so
this
new
relationship
represents
major
step
forward
it
is
change
but
promised
even
more
than
that
told
you
that
as
president
would
work
with
you
to
tackle
the
most
difficult
problems
facing
native
american
families
and
exactly
what
done
we
passed
the
tribal
law
and
order
act
and
began
making
indian
country
safer
place
to
live
we
permanently
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
and
made
quality
health
care
accessible
to
more
native
americans
just
this
week
we
streamlined
leasing
regulations
which
will
lead
to
more
homes
more
businesses
more
renewable
energy
on
the
reservation
what
change
is
and
finally
we
said
that
even
as
we
include
indian
tribes
in
the
broader
promise
of
america
we
going
to
keep
native
traditions
alive
so
when
launched
move
in
indian
country
she
brought
lacrosse
players
to
the
white
house
and
invited
native
american
children
to
plant
the
crops
in
the
white
house
vegetable
garden
while
our
work
together
is
far
from
over
today
we
can
see
what
change
looks
like
it
the
native
small
business
that
opening
its
doors
or
worker
helping
school
renovate
new
roads
and
houses
wind
turbines
going
up
on
tribal
lands
and
crime
going
down
in
tribal
communities
what
change
looks
like
so
we
should
be
proud
of
what
done
together
but
of
course
that
should
sharpen
our
resolve
to
do
even
more
because
as
long
as
native
americans
face
unemployment
and
poverty
rates
that
are
far
higher
than
the
national
average
going
to
have
more
work
to
do
and
wake
up
every
day
focused
on
how
to
get
this
economy
growing
and
create
jobs
for
every
american
faster
working
to
rebuild
an
economy
where
no
matter
who
you
are
no
matter
what
you
look
like
black
white
latino
asian
native
american
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
and
why
proposed
the
american
jobs
act
to
help
all
americans
including
first
americans
make
it
through
these
tough
times
why
my
administration
has
addressed
the
obstacles
that
are
unique
to
indian
country
by
guaranteeing
loans
for
homeowners
and
small
business
owners
and
tribes
why
we
working
to
equip
your
communities
with
internet
access
and
even
as
we
meet
at
this
moment
we
have
to
prepare
the
next
generation
for
the
future
which
is
why
earlier
today
signed
an
executive
order
to
launch
the
white
house
initiative
on
american
indian
and
alaska
native
education
secretary
who
is
here
secretary
going
to
work
together
on
this
effort
to
prepare
native
american
youth
to
compete
for
the
good
jobs
of
tomorrow
going
to
find
ways
to
reduce
the
dropout
rate
going
to
help
students
who
already
dropped
out
the
education
system
and
going
to
strengthen
our
tribal
colleges
and
universities
they
are
cornerstones
of
their
community
and
they
deserve
our
support
so
we
made
progress
together
and
lot
of
that
progress
is
possible
because
of
all
of
you
because
the
ideas
that
shared
at
the
last
two
conferences
and
that
sharing
at
this
conference
and
why
looking
forward
to
hearing
the
results
of
the
discussion
that
you
have
today
want
to
know
what
we
can
do
to
keep
tackling
the
tough
issues
from
education
to
jobs
to
health
care
to
public
safety
it
would
be
nice
to
say
that
the
work
was
done
but
we
know
the
truth
we
solved
all
our
problems
got
long
road
ahead
but
believe
that
one
day
going
to
be
able
to
look
back
on
these
years
and
say
that
this
was
turning
point
this
was
the
moment
when
we
began
to
build
strong
middle
class
in
indian
country
the
moment
when
businesses
large
and
small
began
opening
up
in
reservations
the
moment
when
we
stopped
repeating
the
mistakes
of
the
past
and
began
building
better
future
together
one
that
honors
old
traditions
and
welcomes
every
native
american
into
the
american

oldest
democracies
and

of

oldest
friends

the
people

for
your
extraordinary
hospitality
and
here
in
this
city
this
ancient
want
to
acknowledge
the
original
inhabitants
of
this
land
and
one
of
the
oldest
continuous
cultures
the
first
first
came
to
as
child
between
my
birthplace
of
hawaii
and
where
would
live
for
four
years
as
an
always
understand
your
foreign
language
last
night
did
try
to
talk
some
today
want
to
subject
you
to
any
really
do
love
that
one
and
will
be
introducing
that
into
the
vernacular
in
washington
but
to
young
american
boy
and
its
people
your
optimism
your
ways
your
irreverent
sense
of
all
felt
so
familiar
it
felt
like
home
always
wanted
to
return
tried
last
year
twice
but
this
is
lucky
country
and
today
feel
lucky
to
be
here
as
we
mark
the
anniversary
of
our
unbreakable
alliance
the
bonds
between
us
run
deep
in
each
story
we
see
so
much
of
ourselves
ancestors
who
crossed
vast
oceans
some
by
choice
some
in
chains
settlers
who
pushed
west
across
sweeping
plains
dreamers
who
toiled
with
hearts
and
hands
to
lay
and
to
build
cities
generations
of
immigrants
who
with
each
new
arrival
add
new
thread
to
the
brilliant
tapestry
of
our
nations
and
we
are
citizens
who
live
by
common
creed
no
matter
who
you
are
no
matter
what
you
look
like
everyone
deserves
fair
chance
everyone
deserves
fair
go
of
course
progress
in
our
society
has
not
always
come
without
tensions
or
struggles
to
overcome
painful
past
but
we
are
countries
with
willingness
to
face
our
imperfections
and
to
keep
reaching
for
our
ideals
the
spirit
we
saw
in
this
chamber
three
years
ago
as
this
nation
inspired
the
world
with
historic
gesture
of
reconciliation
with
indigenous
the
spirit
of
progress
in
america
which
allows
me
to
stand
before
you
today
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
spirit
see
later
today
when
become
the
first
president
to
visit
the
northern
territory
where
meet
the
traditional
owners
of
the
land
nor
has
our
progress
come
without
great
sacrifice
this
morning
was
humbled
and
deeply
moved
by
visit
to
your
war
memorial
to
pay
my
respects
to
fallen
sons
and
daughters
later
today
in
darwin
join
the
prime
minister
in
saluting
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
it
will
be
reminder
that
from
the
trenches
of
the
first
world
war
to
the
mountains
of
aussies
and
americans
have
stood
together
we
have
fought
together
we
have
given
lives
together
in
every
single
major
conflict
of
the
past
hundred
years
every
single
one
this
solidarity
has
sustained
us
through
difficult
decade
we
will
never
forget
the
attacks
of
that
took
the
lives
not
only
of
americans
but
people
from
many
nations
including
in
the
united
states
we
will
never
forget
how
invoked
the
treaty
for
the
first
time
ever
showing
that
our
two
nations
stood
as
one
and
none
of
us
will
ever
forget
those
lost
to
terror
in
the
years
since
including
innocent
and
why
as
both
the
prime
minister
and
the
opposition
leader
indicated
we
are
determined
to
succeed
in
it
is
why
salute
outside
of
nato
the
largest
contributor
of
troops
to
this
vital
mission
and
why
we
all
those
who
have
served
there
for
our
security
including
australian
patriots
who
gave
their
lives
among
them
captain
corporal
and
lance
corporal
luke
we
will
their
sacrifice
by
making
sure
that
is
never
again
used
as
source
for
attacks
against
our
people
never
again
as
two
global
partners
we
stand
up
for
the
security
and
the
dignity
of
people
around
the
world
we
see
it
when
our
rescue
workers
rush
to
help
others
in
times
of
fire
and
drought
and
flooding
rains
we
see
it
when
we
partner
to
keep
the
peace
from
east
to
the
and
when
we
pursue
our
shared
vision
world
without
nuclear
weapons
we
see
it
in
the
development
that
lifts
up
child
in
africa
the
assistance
that
saves
family
from
famine
and
when
we
extend
our
support
to
the
people
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
who
deserve
the
same
liberty
that
allows
us
to
gather
in
this
great
hall
of
democracy
this
is
the
alliance
we
reaffirm
today
rooted
in
our
values
renewed
by
every
generation
this
is
the
partnership
we
worked
to
deepen
over
the
past
three
years
and
today
can
stand
before
you
and
say
with
confidence
that
the
alliance
between
the
united
states
and
has
never
been
stronger
it
has
been
to
our
past
our
alliance
continues
to
be
indispensable
to
our
future
so
here
among
close
friends
like
to
address
the
larger
purpose
of
my
visit
to
this
region
our
efforts
to
advance
security
prosperity
and
human
dignity
across
the
asia
pacific
for
the
united
states
this
reflects
broader
shift
after
decade
in
which
we
fought
two
wars
that
cost
us
dearly
in
blood
and
treasure
the
united
states
is
turning
our
attention
to
the
vast
potential
of
the
asia
pacific
region
in
just
few
weeks
after
nearly
nine
years
the
last
american
troops
will
leave
iraq
and
our
war
there
will
be
over
in
begun
transition
responsible
transition
so
afghans
can
take
responsibility
for
their
future
and
so
coalition
forces
can
begin
to
draw
down
and
with
partners
like
struck
major
blows
against
and
put
that
terrorist
on
the
path
to
defeat
including
delivering
justice
to
bin
laden
so
make
no
mistake
the
tide
of
war
is
receding
and
america
is
looking
ahead
to
the
future
that
we
must
build
from
europe
to
the
we
strengthened
alliances
and
partnerships
at
home
investing
in
the
sources
of
our
economic
strength
the
education
of
our
children
the
training
of
our
workers
the
infrastructure
that
fuels
commerce
the
science
and
the
research
that
leads
to
new
breakthroughs
made
hard
decisions
to
cut
our
deficit
and
put
our
fiscal
house
in
order
and
we
will
continue
to
do
more
because
our
economic
strength
at
home
is
the
foundation
of
our
leadership
in
the
world
including
here
in
the
asia
pacific
our
new
focus
on
this
region
reflects
fundamental
truth
the
united
states
has
been
and
always
will
be
pacific
nation
asian
immigrants
helped
build
america
and
millions
of
american
families
including
my
own
cherish
our
ties
to
this
region
from
the
bombing
of
darwin
to
the
liberation
of
pacific
islands
from
the
rice
of
asia
to
cold
korean
peninsula
generations
of
americans
have
served
here
and
died
here
so
democracies
could
take
root
so
economic
miracles
could
lift
hundreds
of
millions
to
prosperity
americans
have
bled
with
you
for
this
progress
and
we
will
not
allow
it
we
will
never
allow
it
to
be
reversed
here
we
see
the
future
as
the
region
and
home
to
more
than
half
the
global
economy
the
asia
pacific
is
critical
to
achieving
my
highest
priority
and
that
creating
jobs
and
opportunity
for
the
american
people
with
most
of
the
nuclear
power
and
some
half
of
humanity
asia
will
largely
define
whether
the
century
ahead
will
be
marked
by
conflict
or
cooperation
needless
suffering
or
human
progress
as
president
have
therefore
made
deliberate
and
strategic
decision
as
pacific
nation
the
united
states
will
play
larger
and
role
in
shaping
this
region
and
its
future
by
upholding
core
principles
and
in
close
partnership
with
our
allies
and
friends
let
me
tell
you
what
this
means
first
we
seek
security
which
is
the
foundation
of
peace
and
prosperity
we
stand
for
an
international
order
in
which
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
all
nations
and
all
people
are
upheld
where
international
law
and
norms
are
enforced
where
commerce
and
freedom
of
navigation
are
not
impeded
where
emerging
powers
contribute
to
regional
security
and
where
disagreements
are
resolved
peacefully
that
the
future
that
we
seek
now
know
that
some
in
this
region
have
wondered
about
commitment
to
upholding
these
principles
so
let
me
address
this
directly
as
the
united
states
puts
our
fiscal
house
in
order
we
are
reducing
our
spending
and
yes
after
decade
of
extraordinary
growth
in
our
military
budgets
and
as
we
definitively
end
the
war
in
iraq
and
begin
to
wind
down
the
war
in
we
will
make
some
reductions
in
spending
as
we
consider
the
future
of
our
armed
forces
we
begun
review
that
will
identify
our
most
important
strategic
interests
and
guide
our
priorities
and
spending
over
the
coming
decade
so
here
is
what
this
region
must
know
as
we
end
wars
have
directed
my
national
security
team
to
make
our
presence
and
mission
in
the
asia
pacific
top
priority
as
result
reductions
in
spending
will
not
repeat
will
not
come
at
the
expense
of
the
asia
pacific
my
guidance
is
clear
as
we
plan
and
budget
for
the
future
we
will
allocate
the
resources
necessary
to
maintain
our
strong
military
presence
in
this
region
we
will
preserve
our
unique
ability
to
project
power
and
deter
threats
to
peace
we
will
keep
our
commitments
including
our
treaty
obligations
to
allies
like
and
we
will
constantly
strengthen
our
capabilities
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
century
our
enduring
interests
in
the
region
demand
our
enduring
presence
in
the
region
the
united
states
is
pacific
power
and
we
are
here
to
stay
indeed
we
are
already
posture
across
the
asia
pacific
it
will
be
more
broadly
distributed
maintaining
our
strong
presence
in
japan
and
the
korean
peninsula
while
enhancing
our
presence
in
asia
our
posture
will
be
more
flexible
with
new
capabilities
to
ensure
that
our
forces
can
operate
freely
and
our
posture
will
be
more
sustainable
by
helping
allies
and
partners
build
their
capacity
with
more
training
and
exercises
we
see
our
new
posture
here
in
the
initiatives
that
the
prime
minister
and
announced
yesterday
will
bring
our
two
even
closer
together
have
new
opportunities
to
train
with
other
allies
and
partners
from
the
pacific
to
the
indian
ocean
and
it
will
allow
us
to
respond
faster
to
the
full
range
of
challenges
including
humanitarian
crises
and
disaster
relief
since
world
war
have
warmly
welcomed
american
service
members
who
passed
through
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
thank
you
for
welcoming
those
who
will
come
next
as
they
ensure
that
our
alliance
stays
strong
and
ready
for
the
tests
of
our
time
we
see
enhanced
presence
in
the
alliance
that
strengthened
in
japan
where
our
alliance
remains
cornerstone
of
regional
security
in
where
partnering
for
disaster
relief
in
the
where
increasing
ship
visits
and
training
and
in
south
korea
where
our
commitment
to
the
security
of
the
republic
of
korea
will
never
waver
indeed
we
also
reiterate
our
resolve
to
act
firmly
against
any
proliferation
activities
by
north
korea
the
transfer
of
nuclear
materials
or
material
by
north
korea
to
states
or
entities
would
be
considered
grave
threat
to
the
united
states
and
our
allies
and
we
would
hold
north
korea
fully
accountable
for
the
consequences
of
such
action
we
see
enhanced
presence
across
asia
in
our
partnership
with
against
piracy
and
violent
extremism
and
in
our
work
with
malaysia
to
prevent
proliferation
in
the
ships
deploy
to
and
in
our
closer
cooperation
with
and
cambodia
and
in
our
welcome
of
india
as
it
and
plays
larger
role
as
an
asian
power
at
the
same
time
with
our
regional
our
work
in
bali
this
week
will
mark
my
third
meeting
with
leaders
and
be
proud
to
be
the
first
american
president
to
attend
the
east
asia
summit
and
together
believe
we
can
address
shared
challenges
such
as
proliferation
and
maritime
security
including
cooperation
in
the
south
china
sea
meanwhile
the
united
states
will
continue
our
effort
to
build
cooperative
relationship
with
china
all
of
our
nations
the
united
states
all
of
our
nations
have
profound
interest
in
the
rise
of
peaceful
and
prosperous
china
that
why
the
united
states
welcomes
it
seen
that
china
can
be
partner
from
reducing
tensions
on
the
korean
peninsula
to
preventing
proliferation
and
seek
more
opportunities
for
cooperation
with
beijing
including
greater
communication
between
our
to
promote
understanding
and
avoid
miscalculation
we
will
do
this
even
as
we
continue
to
speak
candidly
to
beijing
about
the
importance
of
upholding
international
norms
and
respecting
the
universal
human
rights
of
the
chinese
people
secure
and
peaceful
asia
is
the
foundation
for
the
second
area
in
which
america
is
leading
again
and
that
advancing
our
shared
prosperity
history
teaches
us
the
greatest
force
the
world
has
ever
known
for
creating
wealth
and
opportunity
is
free
markets
so
we
seek
economies
that
are
open
and
transparent
we
seek
trade
that
is
free
and
fair
and
we
seek
an
open
international
economic
system
where
rules
are
clear
and
every
nation
plays
by
them
in
and
america
we
understand
these
principles
among
the
most
open
economies
on
earth
six
years
into
our
landmark
trade
agreement
commerce
between
us
has
soared
our
workers
are
creating
new
partnerships
and
new
products
like
the
advanced
aircraft
technologies
we
build
together
in
victoria
the
leading
investor
in
and
you
invest
more
in
america
than
you
do
in
any
other
nation
creating
good
jobs
in
both
countries
we
that
economic
partnerships
just
be
about
one
nation
extracting
resources
we
understand
that
no
strategy
for
growth
can
be
imposed
from
above
real
prosperity
prosperity
that
fosters
innovation
and
prosperity
that
endures
comes
from
unleashing
our
greatest
economic
resource
and
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
the
talents
of
our
people
so
even
as
america
competes
aggressively
in
asian
markets
forging
the
economic
partnerships
that
create
opportunity
for
all
building
on
our
historic
trade
agreement
with
south
korea
working
with
and
our
other
partners
to
create
seamless
regional
economy
and
with
and
other
partners
on
track
to
achieve
our
most
ambitious
trade
agreement
yet
and
potential
model
for
the
entire
region
the
partnership
the
united
states
remains
the
largest
and
most
dynamic
economy
but
in
an
interconnected
world
we
all
rise
and
fall
together
why
pushed
so
hard
to
put
the
at
the
front
and
of
global
economic
to
give
more
nations
leadership
role
in
managing
the
international
economy
including
and
together
we
saved
the
world
economy
from
depression
and
now
our
urgent
challenge
is
to
create
the
growth
that
puts
people
to
work
we
need
growth
that
is
fair
where
every
nation
plays
by
the
rules
where
workers
rights
are
respected
and
our
businesses
can
compete
on
level
playing
field
where
the
intellectual
property
and
new
technologies
that
fuel
innovation
are
protected
and
where
currencies
are
market
driven
so
no
nation
has
an
unfair
advantage
we
also
need
growth
that
is
broad
not
just
for
the
few
but
for
the
many
with
reforms
that
protect
consumers
from
abuse
and
global
commitment
to
end
the
corruption
that
stifles
growth
we
need
growth
that
is
balanced
because
we
will
all
prosper
more
when
countries
with
large
surpluses
take
action
to
boost
demand
at
home
and
we
need
growth
that
is
sustainable
this
includes
the
clean
energy
that
creates
green
jobs
and
combats
climate
change
which
can
not
be
denied
we
see
it
in
the
stronger
fires
the
devastating
floods
the
pacific
islands
confronting
rising
seas
and
as
countries
with
large
carbon
footprints
the
united
states
and
have
special
responsibility
to
lead
every
nation
will
contribute
to
the
solution
in
its
own
way
and
know
this
issue
is
not
without
controversy
in
both
our
countries
but
what
we
can
do
and
what
we
are
doing
is
to
work
together
to
make
unprecedented
investments
in
clean
energy
to
increase
energy
efficiency
and
to
meet
the
commitments
we
made
at
and
we
can
do
this
and
we
will
as
we
grow
our
economies
also
remember
the
link
between
growth
and
good
governance
the
rule
of
law
transparent
institutions
the
equal
administration
of
justice
because
history
shows
that
over
the
long
run
democracy
and
economic
growth
go
hand
in
hand
and
prosperity
without
freedom
is
just
another
form
of
poverty
and
this
brings
me
to
the
final
area
where
we
are
leading
our
support
for
the
fundamental
rights
of
every
human
being
every
nation
will
chart
its
own
course
yet
it
is
also
true
that
certain
rights
are
universal
among
them
freedom
of
freedom
of
the
press
freedom
of
assembly
freedom
of
religion
and
the
freedom
of
citizens
to
choose
their
own
leaders
these
are
not
american
rights
or
australian
rights
or
western
rights
these
are
human
rights
they
stir
in
every
soul
as
seen
in
the
democracies
that
have
succeeded
here
in
asia
other
models
have
been
tried
and
they
have
failed
fascism
and
communism
rule
by
one
man
and
rule
by
committee
and
they
failed
for
the
same
simple
reason
they
ignore
the
ultimate
source
of
power
and
legitimacy
the
will
of
the
people
yes
democracy
can
be
messy
and
rough
understand
you
mix
it
up
quite
well
during
question
time
but
whatever
our
differences
of
party
or
of
ideology
we
know
in
our
democracies
we
are
blessed
with
the
greatest
form
of
government
ever
known
to
man
so
as
two
great
democracies
we
speak
up
for
those
freedoms
when
they
are
threatened
we
partner
with
emerging
democracies
like
to
help
strengthen
the
institutions
upon
which
good
governance
depends
we
encourage
open
government
because
democracies
depend
on
an
informed
and
active
citizenry
we
help
strengthen
civil
societies
because
they
empower
our
citizens
to
hold
their
governments
accountable
and
we
advance
the
rights
of
all
people
women
minorities
and
indigenous
cultures
because
when
societies
harness
the
potential
of
all
their
citizens
these
societies
are
more
successful
they
are
more
prosperous
and
they
are
more
just
these
principles
have
guided
our
approach
to
burma
with
combination
of
sanctions
and
engagement
and
today
san
is
free
from
house
arrest
some
political
prisoners
have
been
released
and
the
government
has
begun
dialogue
still
violations
of
human
rights
persist
so
we
will
continue
to
speak
clearly
about
the
steps
that
must
be
taken
for
the
government
of
burma
to
have
better
relationship
with
the
united
states
this
is
the
future
we
seek
in
the
asia
pacific
security
prosperity
and
dignity
for
all
what
we
stand
for
who
we
are
the
future
we
will
pursue
in
partnership
with
allies
and
friends
and
with
every
element
of
american
power
so
let
there
be
no
doubt
in
the
asia
pacific
in
the
century
the
united
states
of
america
is
all
in
still
in
times
of
great
change
and
uncertainty
the
future
can
seem
unsettling
across
vast
ocean
impossible
to
know
what
lies
beyond
the
horizon
but
if
this
vast
region
and
its
people
teach
us
anything
the
yearning
for
liberty
and
progress
will
not
be
denied
why
women
in
this
country
demanded
that
their
voices
be
heard
making
the
first
nation
to
let
women
vote
and
run
for
parliament
and
one
day
become
prime
minister
why
the
people
took
to
the
streets
from
delhi
to
seoul
from
manila
to
jakarta
to
throw
off
colonialism
and
dictatorship
and
build
some
of
the
largest
democracies
why
soldier
in
watchtower
along
the
defends
free
people
in
the
south
and
why
man
from
the
north
risks
his
life
to
escape
across
the
border
why
soldiers
in
blue
helmets
keep
the
peace
in
new
nation
and
why
women
of
courage
go
into
brothels
to
save
young
girls
from
slavery
which
must
come
to
an
end
why
men
of
peace
in
saffron
robes
faced
beatings
and
bullets
and
why
every
day
from
some
of
the
largest
cities
to
dusty
rural
towns
in
small
acts
of
courage
the
world
may
never
see
student
posts
citizen
signs
charter
an
activist
remains
unbowed
imprisoned
in
his
home
just
to
have
the
same
rights
that
we
cherish
here
today
men
and
women
like
these
know
what
the
world
must
never
forget
the
currents
of
history
may
ebb
and
flow
but
over
time
they
move
decidedly
decisively
in
single
direction
history
is
on
the
side
of
the
free
free
societies
free
governments
free
economies
free
people
and
the
future
belongs
to
those
who
stand
firm
for
those
ideals
in
this
region
and
around
the
world
this
is
the
story
of
the
alliance
we
celebrate
today
this
is
the
essence
of
leadership
it
is
the
essence
of
our
partnership
this
is
the
work
we
will
carry
on
together
for
the
security
and
prosperity
and
dignity
of
all
people
so
god
bless
god
bless
america
and
god
bless
the
friendship
between
our
two
peoples
thank
you
very
much
good

new
strategy

would
end
our

mission
in
iraq
and
remove
all

priorities

combat
mission
in
iraq
and
to
date

for
their
security

that
the
united
states
keeps
its
commitments
he
spoke
of
the
determination
of
the
iraqi
people
to
forge
their
own
future
we
are
in
full
agreement
about
how
to
move
forward
so
today
can
report
that
as
promised
the
rest
of
our
troops
in
iraq
will
come
home

of
thousands
of
them
will
pack
up
their
gear
and
board
convoys
for
the
journey
home
the
last
american
soldier
will
cross
the
border
out
of
iraq
with
their
heads
held
high
proud
of
their
success
and
knowing
that
the
american
people
stand
united
in
our
support
for
our
troops

is
how
military
efforts
in
iraq
will
end
but
even
as
we
mark
this
important
milestone
also
moving
into
new
phase

unleash
the
potential
of
the
iraqi

with
an
iraq
that
contributes
to
regional
security
and
peace
just
as
we
insist
that
other
nations
respect
sovereignty
as
told
prime
minister
we
will
continue
discussions
on
how
we
might
help
iraq
train
and
equip
its
forces
again
just
as
we
offer
training
and
assistance
to
countries
around
the
world
after
all
there
will
be
some
difficult
days
ahead
for
iraq
and
the
united
states
will
continue
to
have
an
interest
in
an
iraq
that
is
stable
secure
and
just
as
iraqis
have
persevered
through
war
confident
that
they
can
build
future
worthy
of
their
history
as
cradle
of
here
at
home
the
coming
months
will
be
another
season
of
homecomings
across
america
our
servicemen
and
women
will
be
reunited
with
their
families
today
can
say
that
our
troops
in
iraq
will
definitely
be
home
for
the
holidays
this
december
will
be
time
to
reflect
on
all
that
been
though
in
this
war
join
the
american
people
in
paying
tribute
to
the
more
than
one
million
americans
who
have
served
in
iraq
our
many
wounded
warriors
and
the
nearly
american
patriots
and
their
iraqi
and
coalition
partners
who
gave
their
lives
to
this
effort
and
finally
would
note
that
the
end
of
war
in
iraq
reflects
larger
transition
the
tide
of
war
is
receding
the
in
iraq
allowed
us
to
refocus
our
fight
against
and
achieve
major
victories
against
its
leadership
including
bin
laden
now
even
as
we
remove
our
last
troops
from
iraq
beginning
to
bring
our
troops
home
from
where
begun
transition
to
afghan
security
and
leadership
when
took
office
roughly
troops
were
deployed
in
both
these
wars
and
by
the
end
of
this
year
that
number
will
be
cut
in
half
and
make
no
mistake
it
will
continue
to
go
down
meanwhile
yesterday
marked
the
definitive
end
of
the
regime
in
libya
and
there
too
our
military
played
critical
role
in
shaping
situation
on
the
ground
in
which
the
libyan
people
can
build
their
own
future
today
nato
is
working
to
bring
this
successful
mission
to
close
so
to
sum
up
the
united
states
is
moving
forward
from
position
of
strength
the
long
war
in
iraq
will
come
to
an
end
by
the
end
of
this
year
the
transition
in
is
moving
forward
and
our
troops
are
finally
coming
home
as
they
do
fewer
deployments
and
more
time
training
will
help
keep
our
military
the
very
best
in
the
world
and
as
we
welcome
home
our
newest
veterans
never
stop
working
to
give
them
and
their
families
the
care
the
benefits
and
the
opportunities
that
they
have
earned
this
includes
enlisting
our
veterans
in
the
greatest
challenge
that
we
now
face
as
nation
creating
opportunity
and
jobs
in
this
country
because
after
decade
of
war
the
nation
that
we
need
to
build
and
the
nation
that
we
will
build
is
our
own
an
america
that
sees
its
economic
strength
restored
just
as
restored
our
leadership
around
the
globe
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
today
the
government
of
libya
announced
the
death
of
this
marks
the
end
of
long
and
painful
chapter
for
the
people
of
libya
who
now
have
the
opportunity
to
determine
their
own
destiny
in
new
and
democratic
libya
for
four
decades
the
regime
ruled
the
libyan
people
with
an
iron
fist
basic
human
rights
were
denied
innocent
civilians
were
detained
beaten
and
killed
and
wealth
was
squandered
the
enormous
potential
of
the
libyan
people
was
held
back
and
terror
was
used
as
political
weapon
today
we
can
definitively
say
that
the
regime
has
come
to
an
end
the
last
major
regime
strongholds
have
fallen
the
new
government
is
consolidating
the
control
over
the
country
and
one
of
the
dictators
is
no
more
one
year
ago
the
notion
of
free
libya
seemed
impossible
but
then
the
libyan
people
rose
up
and
demanded
their
rights
and
when
and
his
forces
started
going
city
to
city
town
by
town
to
men
women
and
children
the
world
refused
to
stand
idly
by
faced
with
the
potential
of
mass
atrocities
and
call
for
help
from
the
libyan
people
the
united
states
and
our
friends
and
allies
stopped
forces
in
their
tracks
coalition
that
included
the
united
states
nato
and
arab
nations
persevered
through
the
summer
to
protect
libyan
civilians
and
meanwhile
the
courageous
libyan
people
fought
for
their
own
future
and
broke
the
back
of
the
regime
so
this
is
momentous
day
in
the
history
of
libya
the
dark
shadow
of
tyranny
has
been
lifted
and
with
this
enormous
promise
the
libyan
people
now
have
great
responsibility
to
build
an
inclusive
and
tolerant
and
democratic
libya
that
stands
as
the
ultimate
rebuke
to
dictatorship
we
look
forward
to
the
announcement
of
the
liberation
the
quick
formation
of
an
interim
government
and
stable
transition
to
first
free
and
fair
elections
and
we
call
on
our
libyan
friends
to
continue
to
work
with
the
international
community
to
secure
dangerous
materials
and
to
respect
the
human
rights
of
all
libyans
including
those
who
have
been
detained
under
no
illusions
libya
will
travel
long
and
winding
road
to
full
democracy
there
will
be
difficult
days
ahead
but
the
united
states
together
with
the
international
community
is
committed
to
the
libyan
people
you
have
won
your
revolution
and
now
we
will
be
partner
as
you
forge
future
that
provides
dignity
freedom
and
opportunity
for
the
region
events
prove
once
more
that
the
rule
of
an
iron
fist
inevitably
comes
to
an
end
across
the
arab
world
citizens
have
stood
up
to
claim
their
rights
youth
are
delivering
powerful
rebuke
to
dictatorship
and
those
leaders
who
try
to
deny
their
human
dignity
will
not
succeed
for
us
here
in
the
united
states
we
are
reminded
today
of
all
those
americans
that
we
lost
at
the
hands
of
terror
their
families
and
friends
are
in
our
thoughts
and
in
our
prayers
we
recall
their
bright
smiles
their
extraordinary
lives
and
their
tragic
deaths
we
know
that
nothing
can
close
the
wound
of
their
loss
but
we
stand
together
as
one
nation
by
their
side
for
nearly
eight
months
many
americans
have
provided
extraordinary
service
in
support
of
our
efforts
to
protect
the
libyan
people
and
to
provide
them
with
chance
to
determine
their
own
destiny
our
skilled
diplomats
have
helped
to
lead
an
unprecedented
global
response
our
brave
pilots
have
flown
in
skies
our
sailors
have
provided
support
off
shores
and
our
leadership
at
nato
has
helped
guide
our
coalition
without
putting
single
service
member
on
the
ground
we
achieved
our
objectives
and
our
nato
mission
will
soon
come
to
an
end
this
comes
at
time
when
we
see
the
strength
of
american
leadership
across
the
world
taken
out
leaders
and
put
them
on
the
path
to
defeat
winding
down
the
war
in
iraq
and
have
begun
transition
in
and
now
working
in
libya
with
friends
and
allies
demonstrated
what
collective
action
can
achieve
in
the
century
of
course
above
all
today
belongs
to
the
people
of
libya
this
is
moment
for
them
to
remember
all
those
who
suffered
and
were
lost
under
and
look
forward
to
the
promise
of
new
day
and
know
the
american
people
wish
the
people
of
libya
the
very
best
in
what
will
be
challenging
but
hopeful
days
weeks
months
and
years
ahead
thank
you
very
much
an
earthquake
and
hurricane
may
have
delayed
this
day
but
this
is
day
that
would
not
be
denied
for
this
day
we
celebrate
martin
luther
king
return
to
the
national
mall
in
this
place
he
will
stand
for
all
time
among
monuments
to
those
who
fathered
this
nation
and
those
who
defended
it
black
preacher
with
no
official
rank
or
title
who
somehow
gave
voice
to
our
deepest
dreams
and
our
most
lasting
ideals
man
who
stirred
our
conscience
and
thereby
helped
make
our
union
more
perfect
and
king
would
be
the
first
to
remind
us
that
this
memorial
is
not
for
him
alone
the
movement
of
which
he
was
part
depended
on
an
entire
generation
of
leaders
many
are
here
today
and
for
their
service
and
their
sacrifice
we
owe
them
our
everlasting
gratitude
this
is
monument
to
your
collective
achievement
some
giants
of
the
civil
rights
movement
like
parks
and
height
benjamin
hooks
reverend
been
taken
from
us
these
past
few
years
this
monument
attests
to
their
strength
and
their
courage
and
while
we
miss
them
dearly
we
know
they
rest
in
better
place
and
finally
there
are
the
multitudes
of
men
and
women
whose
names
never
appear
in
the
history
books
those
who
marched
and
those
who
sang
those
who
sat
in
and
those
who
stood
firm
those
who
and
those
who
all
those
men
and
women
who
through
countless
acts
of
quiet
heroism
helped
bring
about
changes
few
thought
were
even
possible
the
thousands
said
king
anonymous
relentless
young
people
black
and
taken
our
whole
nation
back
to
those
great
wells
of
democracy
which
were
dug
deep
by
the
founding
fathers
in
the
formulation
of
the
constitution
and
the
declaration
of
to
those
men
and
women
to
those
foot
soldiers
for
justice
know
that
this
monument
is
yours
as
well
nearly
half
century
has
passed
since
that
historic
march
on
washington
day
when
thousands
upon
thousands
gathered
for
jobs
and
for
freedom
that
is
what
our
schoolchildren
remember
best
when
they
think
of
king
his
booming
voice
across
this
mall
calling
on
america
to
make
freedom
reality
for
all
of
children
prophesying
of
day
when
the
jangling
discord
of
our
nation
would
be
transformed
into
beautiful
symphony
of
brotherhood
it
is
right
that
we
that
march
that
we
lift
up
have
for
without
that
shining
moment
without
glorious
words
we
might
not
have
had
the
courage
to
come
as
far
as
we
have
because
of
that
hopeful
vision
because
of
moral
imagination
barricades
began
to
fall
and
bigotry
began
to
fade
new
doors
of
opportunity
swung
open
for
an
entire
generation
yes
laws
changed
but
hearts
and
minds
changed
as
well
look
at
the
faces
here
around
you
and
you
see
an
america
that
is
more
fair
and
more
free
and
more
just
than
the
one
king
addressed
that
day
we
are
right
to
that
slow
but
certain
progress
progress
expressed
itself
in
million
ways
large
and
small
across
this
nation
every
single
day
as
people
of
all
and
creeds
live
together
and
work
together
and
fight
alongside
one
another
and
learn
together
and
build
together
and
love
one
another
so
it
is
right
for
us
to
celebrate
today
dream
and
his
vision
of
unity
and
yet
it
is
also
important
on
this
day
to
remind
ourselves
that
such
progress
did
not
come
easily
that
faith
was
that
it
sprung
out
of
harsh
reality
and
some
bitter
disappointments
it
is
right
for
us
to
celebrate
oratory
but
it
is
worth
remembering
that
progress
did
not
come
from
words
alone
progress
was
hard
progress
was
purchased
through
enduring
the
smack
of
billy
clubs
and
the
blast
of
fire
hoses
it
was
bought
with
days
in
jail
cells
and
nights
of
bomb
threats
for
every
victory
during
the
height
of
the
civil
rights
movement
there
were
setbacks
and
there
were
defeats
we
forget
now
but
during
his
life
king
always
considered
unifying
figure
even
after
rising
to
prominence
even
after
winning
the
peace
prize
king
was
vilified
by
many
denounced
as
rabble
and
an
agitator
communist
and
radical
he
was
even
attacked
by
his
own
people
by
those
who
felt
he
was
going
too
fast
or
those
who
felt
he
was
going
too
slow
by
those
who
felt
he
meddle
in
issues
like
the
war
or
the
rights
of
union
workers
we
know
from
his
own
testimony
the
doubts
and
the
pain
this
caused
him
and
that
the
controversy
that
would
swirl
around
his
actions
would
last
until
the
fateful
day
he
died
raise
all
this
because
nearly
years
after
the
march
on
washington
our
work
work
is
not
yet
complete
we
gather
here
at
moment
of
great
challenge
and
great
change
in
the
first
decade
of
this
new
century
we
have
been
tested
by
war
and
by
tragedy
by
an
economic
crisis
and
its
aftermath
that
has
left
millions
out
of
work
and
poverty
on
the
rise
and
millions
more
just
struggling
to
get
by
indeed
even
before
this
crisis
struck
we
had
endured
decade
of
rising
inequality
and
stagnant
wages
in
too
many
troubled
across
the
country
the
conditions
of
our
poorest
citizens
appear
little
changed
from
what
existed
years
ago
with
underfunded
schools
and
slums
inadequate
health
care
constant
violence
in
which
too
many
young
people
grow
up
with
little
hope
and
few
prospects
for
the
future
our
work
is
not
done
and
so
on
this
day
in
which
we
celebrate
man
and
movement
that
did
so
much
for
this
country
let
us
draw
strength
from
those
earlier
struggles
first
and
foremost
let
us
remember
that
change
has
never
been
quick
change
has
never
been
simple
or
without
controversy
change
depends
on
persistence
change
requires
determination
it
took
full
decade
before
the
moral
guidance
of
brown
board
of
education
was
translated
into
the
enforcement
measures
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
voting
rights
act
but
those
long
years
did
not
lead
king
to
give
up
he
kept
on
pushing
he
kept
on
speaking
he
kept
on
marching
until
change
finally
came
and
then
when
even
after
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
voting
rights
act
passed
african
americans
still
found
themselves
trapped
in
pockets
of
poverty
across
the
country
king
say
those
laws
were
failure
he
say
this
is
too
hard
he
say
settle
for
what
we
got
and
go
home
instead
he
said
take
those
victories
and
broaden
our
mission
to
achieve
not
just
civil
and
political
equality
but
also
economic
justice
fight
for
living
wage
and
better
schools
and
jobs
for
all
who
are
willing
to
work
in
other
words
when
met
with
hardship
when
confronting
disappointment
king
refused
to
accept
what
he
called
the
of
today
he
kept
pushing
towards
the
of
tomorrow
and
so
as
we
think
about
all
the
work
that
we
must
do
rebuilding
an
economy
that
can
compete
on
global
stage
and
fixing
our
schools
so
that
every
child
not
just
some
but
every
child
gets
education
and
making
sure
that
our
health
care
system
is
affordable
and
accessible
to
all
and
that
our
economic
system
is
one
in
which
everybody
gets
fair
shake
and
everybody
does
their
fair
share
let
us
not
be
trapped
by
what
is
we
be
discouraged
by
what
is
got
to
keep
pushing
for
what
ought
to
be
the
america
we
ought
to
leave
to
our
children
mindful
that
the
hardships
we
face
are
nothing
compared
to
those
king
and
his
fellow
marchers
faced
years
ago
and
that
if
we
maintain
our
faith
in
ourselves
and
in
the
possibilities
of
this
nation
there
is
no
challenge
we
can
not
surmount
and
just
as
we
draw
strength
from
struggles
so
must
we
draw
inspiration
from
his
constant
insistence
on
the
oneness
of
man
the
belief
in
his
words
that
are
caught
in
an
inescapable
network
of
mutuality
tied
in
single
garment
of
it
was
that
insistence
rooted
in
his
christian
faith
that
led
him
to
tell
group
of
angry
young
protesters
love
you
as
love
my
own
children
even
as
one
threw
rock
that
glanced
off
his
neck
it
was
that
insistence
that
belief
that
god
resides
in
each
of
us
from
the
high
to
the
low
in
the
oppressor
and
the
oppressed
that
convinced
him
that
people
and
systems
could
change
it
fortified
his
belief
in
it
permitted
him
to
place
his
faith
in
government
that
had
fallen
short
of
its
ideals
it
led
him
to
see
his
charge
not
only
as
freeing
black
america
from
the
shackles
of
discrimination
but
also
freeing
many
americans
from
their
own
prejudices
and
freeing
americans
of
every
from
the
depredations
of
poverty
and
so
at
this
moment
when
our
politics
appear
so
sharply
and
faith
in
our
institutions
so
greatly
diminished
we
need
more
than
ever
to
take
heed
of
teachings
he
calls
on
us
to
stand
in
the
other
shoes
to
see
through
their
eyes
to
understand
their
pain
he
tells
us
that
we
have
duty
to
fight
against
poverty
even
if
we
are
well
off
to
care
about
the
child
in
the
decrepit
school
even
if
our
own
children
are
doing
fine
to
show
compassion
toward
the
immigrant
family
with
the
knowledge
that
most
of
us
are
only
few
generations
removed
from
similar
hardships
to
say
that
we
are
bound
together
as
one
people
and
must
constantly
strive
to
see
ourselves
in
one
another
is
not
to
argue
for
false
unity
that
papers
over
our
differences
and
ratifies
an
unjust
status
as
was
true
years
ago
as
has
been
true
throughout
human
history
those
with
power
and
privilege
will
often
decry
any
call
for
change
as
say
any
challenge
to
the
existing
arrangements
are
unwise
and
king
understood
that
peace
without
justice
was
no
peace
at
all
that
aligning
our
reality
with
our
ideals
often
requires
the
speaking
of
uncomfortable
truths
and
the
creative
tension
of
protest
but
he
also
understood
that
to
bring
about
true
and
lasting
change
there
must
be
the
possibility
of
reconciliation
that
any
social
movement
has
to
channel
this
tension
through
the
spirit
of
love
and
mutuality
if
he
were
alive
today
believe
he
would
remind
us
that
the
unemployed
worker
can
rightly
challenge
the
excesses
of
wall
street
without
all
who
work
there
that
the
businessman
can
enter
tough
negotiations
with
his
union
without
vilifying
the
right
to
collectively
bargain
he
would
want
us
to
know
we
can
argue
fiercely
about
the
proper
size
and
role
of
government
without
questioning
each
love
for
this
country
with
the
knowledge
that
in
this
democracy
government
is
no
distant
object
but
is
rather
an
expression
of
our
common
commitments
to
one
another
he
would
call
on
us
to
assume
the
best
in
each
other
rather
than
the
worst
and
challenge
one
another
in
ways
that
ultimately
heal
rather
than
wound
in
the
end
what
hope
my
daughters
take
away
from
this
monument
want
them
to
come
away
from
here
with
faith
in
what
they
can
accomplish
when
they
are
determined
and
working
for
righteous
cause
want
them
to
come
away
from
here
with
faith
in
other
people
and
faith
in
benevolent
god
this
sculpture
massive
and
iconic
as
it
is
will
remind
them
of
strength
but
to
see
him
only
as
larger
than
life
would
do
disservice
to
what
he
taught
us
about
ourselves
he
would
want
them
to
know
that
he
had
setbacks
because
they
will
have
setbacks
he
would
want
them
to
know
that
he
had
doubts
because
they
will
have
doubts
he
would
want
them
to
know
that
he
was
flawed
because
all
of
us
have
flaws
it
is
precisely
because
king
was
man
of
flesh
and
blood
and
not
figure
of
stone
that
he
inspires
us
so
his
life
his
story
tells
us
that
change
can
come
if
you
give
up
he
would
not
give
up
no
matter
how
long
it
took
because
in
the
smallest
hamlets
and
the
darkest
slums
he
had
witnessed
the
highest
reaches
of
the
human
spirit
because
in
those
moments
when
the
struggle
seemed
most
hopeless
he
had
seen
men
and
women
and
children
conquer
their
fear
because
he
had
seen
hills
and
mountains
made
low
and
rough
places
made
plain
and
the
crooked
places
made
straight
and
god
make
way
out
of
no
way
and
that
is
why
we
this
man
because
he
had
faith
in
us
and
that
is
why
he
belongs
on
this
mall
because
he
saw
what
we
might
become
that
is
why
king
was
so
quintessentially
american
because
for
all
the
hardships
endured
for
all
our
sometimes
tragic
history
ours
is
story
of
optimism
and
achievement
and
constant
striving
that
is
unique
upon
this
earth
and
that
is
why
the
rest
of
the
world
still
looks
to
us
to
lead
this
is
country
where
ordinary
people
find
in
their
hearts
the
courage
to
do
extraordinary
things
the
courage
to
stand
up
in
the
face
of
the
fiercest
resistance
and
despair
and
say
this
is
wrong
and
this
is
right
we
will
not
settle
for
what
the
cynics
tell
us
we
have
to
accept
and
we
will
reach
again
and
again
no
matter
the
odds
for
what
we
know
is
possible
that
is
the
conviction
we
must
carry
now
in
our
hearts
as
tough
as
times
may
be
know
we
will
overcome
know
there
are
better
days
ahead
know
this
because
of
the
man
towering
over
us
know
this
because
all
he
and
his
generation
endured
we
are
here
today
in
country
that
dedicated
monument
to
that
legacy
and
so
with
our
eyes
on
the
horizon
and
our
faith
squarely
placed
in
one
another
let
us
keep
striving
let
us
keep
struggling
let
us
keep
climbing
toward
that
promised
land
of
nation
and
world
that
is
more
fair
and
more
just
and
more
equal
for
every
single
child
of
god
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
president
secretary
general
fellow
delegates
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
great
for
me
to
be
here
today
would
like
to
talk
to
you
about
subject
that
is
at
the
heart
of
the
united
nations
the
pursuit
of
peace
in
an
imperfect
world
war
and
conflict
have
been
with
us
since
the
beginning
of
but
in
the
first
part
of
the
century
the
advance
of
modern
weaponry
led
to
death
on
staggering
scale
it
was
this
killing
that
compelled
the
founders
of
this
body
to
build
an
institution
that
was
focused
not
just
on
ending
one
war
but
on
averting
others
union
of
sovereign
states
that
would
seek
to
prevent
conflict
while
also
addressing
its
causes
no
american
did
more
to
pursue
this
objective
than
president
he
knew
that
victory
in
war
was
not
enough
as
he
said
at
one
of
the
very
first
meetings
on
the
founding
of
the
united
nations
have
got
to
make
not
merely
peace
but
peace
that
will
the
men
and
women
who
built
this
institution
understood
that
peace
is
more
than
just
the
absence
of
war
lasting
peace
for
nations
and
for
individuals
depends
on
sense
of
justice
and
opportunity
of
dignity
and
freedom
it
depends
on
struggle
and
sacrifice
on
compromise
and
on
sense
of
common
humanity
one
delegate
to
the
san
conference
that
led
to
the
creation
of
the
united
nations
put
it
well
people
she
said
talked
as
if
all
that
has
to
be
done
to
get
peace
was
to
say
loudly
and
frequently
that
we
loved
peace
and
we
hated
war
now
we
have
learned
that
no
matter
how
much
we
love
peace
and
hate
war
we
can
not
avoid
having
war
brought
upon
us
if
there
are
convulsions
in
other
parts
of
the
the
fact
is
peace
is
hard
but
our
people
demand
it
over
nearly
seven
decades
even
as
the
united
nations
helped
avert
third
world
war
we
still
live
in
world
scarred
by
conflict
and
plagued
by
poverty
even
as
we
proclaim
our
love
for
peace
and
our
hatred
of
war
there
are
still
convulsions
in
our
world
that
endanger
us
all
took
office
at
time
of
two
wars
for
the
united
states
moreover
the
violent
extremists
who
drew
us
into
war
in
the
first
place
bin
laden
and
his
remained
at
large
today
we
set
new
direction
at
the
end
of
this
year
military
operation
in
iraq
will
be
over
we
will
have
normal
relationship
with
sovereign
nation
that
is
member
of
the
community
of
nations
that
equal
partnership
will
be
strengthened
by
our
support
for
iraq
for
its
government
and
for
its
security
forces
for
its
people
and
for
their
aspirations
as
we
end
the
war
in
iraq
the
united
states
and
our
coalition
partners
have
begun
transition
in
between
now
and
an
increasingly
capable
afghan
government
and
security
forces
will
step
forward
to
take
responsibility
for
the
future
of
their
country
as
they
do
we
are
drawing
down
our
own
forces
while
building
an
enduring
partnership
with
the
afghan
people
so
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
tide
of
war
is
receding
when
took
office
roughly
americans
were
serving
in
iraq
and
by
the
end
of
this
year
that
number
will
be
cut
in
half
and
it
will
continue
to
decline
this
is
critical
for
the
sovereignty
of
iraq
and
also
critical
to
the
strength
of
the
united
states
as
we
build
our
nation
at
home
moreover
we
are
poised
to
end
these
wars
from
position
of
strength
ten
years
ago
there
was
an
open
wound
and
twisted
steel
broken
heart
in
the
of
this
city
today
as
new
tower
is
rising
at
ground
zero
it
new
renewal
even
as
is
under
more
pressure
than
ever
before
its
leadership
has
been
degraded
and
bin
laden
man
who
murdered
thousands
of
people
from
dozens
of
countries
will
never
endanger
the
peace
of
the
world
again
so
yes
this
has
been
difficult
decade
but
today
we
stand
at
crossroads
of
history
with
the
chance
to
move
decisively
in
the
direction
of
peace
to
do
so
we
must
return
to
the
wisdom
of
those
who
created
this
institution
the
united
founding
charter
calls
upon
us
to
unite
our
strength
to
maintain
international
peace
and
security
and
article
of
this
general
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
reminds
us
that
all
human
beings
are
born
free
and
equal
in
dignity
and
in
rights
those
bedrock
beliefs
in
the
responsibility
of
states
and
the
rights
of
men
and
women
must
be
our
guide
and
in
that
effort
we
have
reason
to
hope
this
year
has
been
time
of
extraordinary
transformation
more
nations
have
stepped
forward
to
maintain
international
peace
and
security
and
more
individuals
are
claiming
their
universal
right
to
live
in
freedom
and
dignity
think
about
it
one
year
ago
when
we
met
here
in
new
york
the
prospect
of
successful
referendum
in
south
sudan
was
in
doubt
but
the
international
community
overcame
old
divisions
to
support
the
agreement
that
had
been
negotiated
to
give
south
sudan
and
last
summer
as
new
flag
went
up
in
former
soldiers
laid
down
their
arms
men
and
women
wept
with
joy
and
children
finally
knew
the
promise
of
looking
to
future
that
they
will
shape
one
year
ago
the
people
of
approached
landmark
election
and
when
the
incumbent
lost
and
refused
to
respect
the
results
the
world
refused
to
look
the
other
way
peacekeepers
were
harassed
but
they
did
not
leave
their
posts
the
security
council
led
by
the
united
states
and
nigeria
and
france
came
together
to
support
the
will
of
the
people
and
is
now
governed
by
the
man
who
was
elected
to
lead
one
year
ago
the
hopes
of
the
people
of
tunisia
were
suppressed
but
they
chose
the
dignity
of
peaceful
protest
over
the
rule
of
an
iron
fist
vendor
lit
spark
that
took
his
own
life
but
he
ignited
movement
in
face
of
crackdown
students
spelled
out
the
word
freedom
the
balance
of
fear
shifted
from
the
ruler
to
those
that
he
ruled
and
now
the
people
of
tunisia
are
preparing
for
elections
that
will
move
them
one
step
closer
to
the
democracy
that
they
deserve
one
year
ago
egypt
had
known
one
president
for
nearly
years
but
for
days
the
eyes
of
the
world
were
glued
to
square
where
from
all
walks
of
life
men
and
women
young
and
old
muslim
and
christian
demanded
their
universal
rights
we
saw
in
those
protesters
the
moral
force
of
that
has
lit
the
world
from
delhi
to
warsaw
from
to
south
africa
and
we
knew
that
change
had
come
to
egypt
and
to
the
arab
world
one
year
ago
the
people
of
libya
were
ruled
by
the
dictator
but
faced
with
bullets
and
bombs
and
dictator
who
threatened
to
hunt
them
down
like
rats
they
showed
relentless
bravery
we
will
never
forget
the
words
of
the
libyan
who
stood
up
in
those
early
days
of
the
revolution
and
said
words
are
free
feeling
you
explain
day
after
day
in
the
face
of
bullets
and
bombs
the
libyan
people
refused
to
give
back
that
freedom
and
when
they
were
threatened
by
the
kind
of
mass
atrocity
that
often
went
unchallenged
in
the
last
century
the
united
nations
lived
up
to
its
charter
the
security
council
all
necessary
measures
to
prevent
massacre
the
arab
league
called
for
this
effort
arab
nations
joined
coalition
that
halted
forces
in
their
tracks
in
the
months
that
followed
the
will
of
the
coalition
proved
unbreakable
and
the
will
of
the
libyan
people
could
not
be
denied
years
of
tyranny
was
ended
in
six
months
from
tripoli
to
to
today
libya
is
free
yesterday
the
leaders
of
new
libya
took
their
rightful
place
beside
us
and
this
week
the
united
states
is
reopening
our
embassy
in
tripoli
this
is
how
the
international
community
is
supposed
to
work
nations
standing
together
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
security
and
individuals
claiming
their
rights
now
all
of
us
have
responsibility
to
support
the
new
libya
the
new
libyan
government
as
they
confront
the
challenge
of
turning
this
moment
of
promise
into
just
and
lasting
peace
for
all
libyans
so
this
has
been
remarkable
year
the
regime
is
over
ben
are
no
longer
in
power
bin
laden
is
gone
and
the
idea
that
change
could
only
come
through
violence
has
been
buried
with
him
something
is
happening
in
our
world
the
way
things
have
been
is
not
the
way
that
they
will
be
the
humiliating
grip
of
corruption
and
tyranny
is
being
pried
open
dictators
are
on
notice
technology
is
putting
power
into
the
hands
of
the
people
the
youth
are
delivering
powerful
rebuke
to
dictatorship
and
rejecting
the
lie
that
some
races
some
peoples
some
religions
some
do
not
desire
democracy
the
promise
written
down
on
paper
all
human
beings
are
born
free
and
equal
in
dignity
and
rights
is
closer
at
hand
but
let
us
remember
peace
is
hard
peace
is
hard
progress
can
be
reversed
prosperity
comes
slowly
societies
can
split
apart
the
measure
of
our
success
must
be
whether
people
can
live
in
sustained
freedom
dignity
and
security
and
the
united
nations
and
its
member
states
must
do
their
part
to
support
those
basic
aspirations
and
we
have
more
work
to
do
in
iran
we
seen
government
that
refuses
to
the
rights
of
its
own
people
as
we
meet
here
today
men
and
women
and
children
are
being
tortured
detained
and
murdered
by
the
syrian
regime
thousands
have
been
killed
many
during
the
holy
time
of
thousands
more
have
poured
across
borders
the
syrian
people
have
shown
dignity
and
courage
in
their
pursuit
of
justice
protesting
peacefully
standing
silently
in
the
streets
dying
for
the
same
values
that
this
institution
is
supposed
to
stand
for
and
the
question
for
us
is
clear
will
we
stand
with
the
syrian
people
or
with
their
oppressors
already
the
united
states
has
imposed
strong
sanctions
on
leaders
we
supported
transfer
of
power
that
is
responsive
to
the
syrian
people
and
many
of
our
allies
have
joined
in
this
effort
but
for
the
sake
of
syria
and
the
peace
and
security
of
the
world
we
must
speak
with
one
voice
there
no
excuse
for
inaction
now
is
the
time
for
the
united
nations
security
council
to
sanction
the
syrian
regime
and
to
stand
with
the
syrian
people
throughout
the
region
we
will
have
to
respond
to
the
calls
for
change
in
yemen
men
women
and
children
gather
by
the
thousands
in
towns
and
city
squares
every
day
with
the
hope
that
their
determination
and
spilled
blood
will
prevail
over
corrupt
system
america
supports
those
aspirations
we
must
work
with
and
our
partners
around
the
world
to
seek
path
that
allows
for
peaceful
transition
of
power
from
president
and
movement
to
free
and
fair
elections
as
soon
as
possible
in
steps
have
been
taken
toward
reform
and
accountability
pleased
with
that
but
more
is
required
america
is
close
friend
of
and
we
will
continue
to
call
on
the
government
and
the
main
opposition
bloc
the
to
pursue
meaningful
dialogue
that
brings
peaceful
change
that
is
responsive
to
the
people
we
believe
the
patriotism
that
binds
together
must
be
more
powerful
than
the
sectarian
forces
that
would
tear
them
apart
it
will
be
hard
but
it
is
possible
we
believe
that
each
nation
must
chart
its
own
course
to
the
aspirations
of
its
people
and
america
does
not
expect
to
agree
with
every
party
or
person
who
expresses
themselves
politically
but
we
will
always
stand
up
for
the
universal
rights
that
were
embraced
by
this
assembly
those
rights
depend
on
elections
that
are
free
and
fair
on
governance
that
is
transparent
and
accountable
respect
for
the
rights
of
women
and
minorities
justice
that
is
equal
and
fair
that
is
what
our
people
deserve
those
are
the
elements
of
peace
that
can
last
moreover
the
united
states
will
continue
to
support
those
nations
that
transition
to
democracy
with
greater
trade
and
investment
so
that
freedom
is
followed
by
opportunity
we
will
pursue
deeper
engagement
with
governments
but
also
with
civil
society
students
and
entrepreneurs
political
parties
and
the
press
we
have
banned
those
who
abuse
human
rights
from
to
our
country
and
sanctioned
those
who
trample
on
human
rights
abroad
and
we
will
always
serve
as
voice
for
those
who
been
silenced
now
know
particularly
this
week
that
for
many
in
this
hall
there
one
issue
that
stands
as
test
for
these
principles
and
test
for
american
foreign
policy
and
that
is
the
conflict
between
the
israelis
and
the
one
year
ago
stood
at
this
podium
and
called
for
an
independent
believed
then
and
believe
now
that
the
people
deserve
state
of
their
own
but
what
also
said
is
that
genuine
peace
can
only
be
between
the
israelis
and
the
themselves
one
year
later
despite
extensive
efforts
by
america
and
others
the
parties
have
not
bridged
their
differences
faced
with
this
stalemate
put
forward
new
basis
for
negotiations
in
may
of
this
year
that
basis
is
clear
well
known
to
all
of
us
here
israelis
must
know
that
any
agreement
provides
assurances
for
their
security
deserve
to
know
the
territorial
basis
of
their
state
now
know
that
many
are
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
progress
assure
you
so
am
but
the
question
the
goal
that
we
seek
the
question
is
how
do
we
reach
that
goal
and
am
convinced
that
there
is
no
short
cut
to
the
end
of
conflict
that
has
endured
for
decades
peace
is
hard
work
peace
will
not
come
through
statements
and
resolutions
at
the
united
nations
if
it
were
that
easy
it
would
have
been
accomplished
by
now
ultimately
it
is
the
israelis
and
the
who
must
live
side
by
side
ultimately
it
is
the
israelis
and
the
not
us
who
must
reach
agreement
on
the
issues
that
divide
them
on
borders
and
on
security
on
refugees
and
ultimately
peace
depends
upon
compromise
among
people
who
must
live
together
long
after
our
speeches
are
over
long
after
our
votes
have
been
tallied
the
lesson
of
northern
ireland
where
ancient
antagonists
bridged
their
differences
the
lesson
of
sudan
where
negotiated
settlement
led
to
an
independent
state
and
that
is
and
will
be
the
path
to
state
negotiations
between
the
parties
we
seek
future
where
live
in
sovereign
state
of
their
own
with
no
limit
to
what
they
can
achieve
no
question
that
the
have
seen
that
vision
delayed
for
too
long
it
is
precisely
because
we
believe
so
strongly
in
the
aspirations
of
the
people
that
america
has
invested
so
much
time
and
so
much
effort
in
the
building
of
state
and
the
negotiations
that
can
deliver
state
but
understand
this
as
well
commitment
to
security
is
unshakeable
our
friendship
with
israel
is
deep
and
enduring
and
so
we
believe
that
any
lasting
peace
must
acknowledge
the
very
real
security
concerns
that
israel
faces
every
single
day
let
us
be
honest
with
ourselves
israel
is
surrounded
by
that
have
waged
repeated
wars
against
it
citizens
have
been
killed
by
rockets
fired
at
their
houses
and
suicide
bombs
on
their
buses
children
come
of
age
knowing
that
throughout
the
region
other
children
are
taught
to
hate
them
israel
small
country
of
less
than
eight
million
people
look
out
at
world
where
leaders
of
much
larger
nations
threaten
to
wipe
it
off
of
the
map
the
jewish
people
carry
the
burden
of
centuries
of
exile
and
persecution
and
fresh
memories
of
knowing
that
six
million
people
were
killed
simply
because
of
who
they
are
those
are
facts
they
can
not
be
denied
the
jewish
people
have
forged
successful
state
in
their
historic
homeland
israel
deserves
recognition
it
deserves
normal
relations
with
its
and
friends
of
the
do
them
no
by
ignoring
this
truth
just
as
friends
of
israel
must
the
need
to
pursue
solution
with
secure
israel
next
to
an
independent
that
is
the
truth
each
side
has
legitimate
aspirations
and
part
of
what
makes
peace
so
hard
and
the
deadlock
will
only
be
broken
when
each
side
learns
to
stand
in
the
shoes
each
side
can
see
the
world
through
the
eyes
what
we
should
be
encouraging
what
we
should
be
promoting
this
body
founded
as
it
was
out
of
the
ashes
of
war
and
genocide
dedicated
as
it
is
to
the
dignity
of
every
single
person
must
the
reality
that
is
lived
by
both
the
and
the
israelis
the
measure
of
our
actions
must
always
be
whether
they
advance
the
right
of
israeli
and
children
to
live
lives
of
peace
and
security
and
dignity
and
opportunity
and
we
will
only
succeed
in
that
effort
if
we
can
encourage
the
parties
to
sit
down
to
listen
to
each
other
and
to
understand
each
hopes
and
each
fears
that
is
the
project
to
which
america
is
committed
there
are
no
shortcuts
and
that
is
what
the
united
nations
should
be
focused
on
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
now
even
as
we
confront
these
challenges
of
conflict
and
revolution
we
must
also
we
must
also
remind
ourselves
that
peace
is
not
just
the
absence
of
war
true
peace
depends
on
creating
the
opportunity
that
makes
life
worth
living
and
to
do
that
we
must
confront
the
common
enemies
of
humanity
nuclear
weapons
and
poverty
ignorance
and
disease
these
forces
corrode
the
possibility
of
lasting
peace
and
together
we
called
upon
to
confront
them
to
lift
the
of
mass
destruction
we
must
come
together
to
pursue
the
peace
and
security
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
over
the
last
two
years
we
begun
to
walk
down
that
path
since
our
nuclear
security
summit
in
washington
nearly
nations
have
taken
steps
to
secure
nuclear
materials
from
terrorists
and
smugglers
next
march
summit
in
seoul
will
advance
our
efforts
to
lock
down
all
of
them
the
new
start
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
russia
will
cut
our
deployed
arsenals
to
the
lowest
level
in
half
century
and
our
nations
are
pursuing
talks
on
how
to
achieve
even
deeper
reductions
america
will
continue
to
work
for
ban
on
the
testing
of
nuclear
weapons
and
the
production
of
fissile
material
needed
to
make
them
and
so
we
have
begun
to
move
in
the
right
direction
and
the
united
states
is
committed
to
meeting
our
obligations
but
even
as
we
meet
our
obligations
strengthened
the
treaties
and
institutions
that
help
stop
the
spread
of
these
weapons
and
to
do
so
we
must
continue
to
hold
accountable
those
nations
that
flout
them
the
iranian
government
can
not
demonstrate
that
its
program
is
peaceful
it
has
not
met
its
obligations
and
it
rejects
offers
that
would
provide
it
with
peaceful
nuclear
power
north
korea
has
yet
to
take
concrete
steps
towards
its
weapons
and
continues
belligerent
action
against
the
south
there
future
of
greater
opportunity
for
the
people
of
these
nations
if
their
governments
meet
their
international
obligations
but
if
they
continue
down
path
that
is
outside
international
law
they
must
be
met
with
greater
pressure
and
isolation
that
is
what
our
commitment
to
peace
and
security
demands
to
bring
prosperity
to
our
people
we
must
promote
the
growth
that
creates
opportunity
in
this
effort
let
us
not
forget
that
made
enormous
progress
over
the
last
several
decades
closed
societies
gave
way
to
open
markets
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
has
transformed
the
way
we
live
and
the
things
that
we
do
emerging
economies
from
asia
to
the
have
lifted
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
from
poverty
an
extraordinary
achievement
and
yet
three
years
ago
we
were
confronted
with
the
worst
financial
crisis
in
eight
decades
and
that
crisis
proved
fact
that
has
become
clearer
with
each
passing
year
our
fates
are
interconnected
in
global
economy
nations
will
rise
or
fall
together
and
today
we
confront
the
challenges
that
have
followed
on
the
heels
of
that
crisis
around
the
world
recovery
is
still
fragile
markets
remain
volatile
too
many
people
are
out
of
work
too
many
others
are
struggling
just
to
get
by
we
acted
together
to
avert
depression
in
we
must
take
urgent
and
coordinated
action
once
more
here
in
the
united
states
announced
plan
to
put
americans
back
to
work
and
jumpstart
our
economy
at
the
same
time
as
committed
to
substantially
reducing
our
deficits
over
time
we
stand
with
our
european
allies
as
they
reshape
their
institutions
and
address
their
own
fiscal
challenges
for
other
countries
leaders
face
different
challenge
as
they
shift
their
economy
towards
more
boosting
domestic
demand
while
slowing
inflation
so
we
will
work
with
emerging
economies
that
have
rebounded
strongly
so
that
rising
standards
of
living
create
new
markets
that
promote
global
growth
what
our
commitment
to
prosperity
demands
to
combat
the
poverty
that
punishes
our
children
we
must
act
on
the
belief
that
freedom
from
want
is
basic
human
right
the
united
states
has
made
it
focus
of
our
engagement
abroad
to
help
people
to
feed
themselves
and
today
as
drought
and
conflict
have
brought
famine
to
the
horn
of
africa
our
conscience
calls
on
us
to
act
together
we
must
continue
to
provide
assistance
and
support
that
can
reach
those
in
need
and
together
we
must
insist
on
unrestricted
humanitarian
access
so
that
we
can
save
the
lives
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
and
children
our
common
humanity
is
at
stake
let
us
show
that
the
life
of
child
in
somalia
is
as
precious
as
any
other
that
is
what
our
commitment
to
our
fellow
human
beings
demand
to
stop
disease
that
spreads
across
borders
we
must
strengthen
our
system
of
public
health
we
will
continue
the
fight
against
tuberculosis
and
malaria
we
will
focus
on
the
health
of
mothers
and
of
children
and
we
must
come
together
to
prevent
and
detect
and
fight
every
kind
of
biological
danger
whether
pandemic
like
or
terrorist
threat
or
treatable
disease
this
week
america
signed
an
agreement
with
the
world
health
to
affirm
our
commitment
to
meet
this
challenge
and
today
urge
all
nations
to
join
us
in
meeting
the
sic
goal
of
making
sure
all
nations
have
core
capacities
to
address
public
health
emergencies
in
place
by
that
is
what
our
commitment
to
the
health
of
our
people
demands
to
preserve
our
planet
we
must
not
put
off
action
that
climate
change
demands
we
have
to
tap
the
power
of
science
to
save
those
resources
that
are
scarce
and
together
we
must
continue
our
work
to
build
on
the
progress
made
in
and
so
that
all
the
major
economies
here
today
follow
through
on
the
commitments
that
were
made
together
we
must
work
to
transform
the
energy
that
powers
our
economies
and
support
others
as
they
move
down
that
path
that
is
what
our
commitment
to
the
next
generation
demands
and
to
make
sure
our
societies
reach
their
potential
we
must
allow
our
citizens
to
reach
theirs
no
country
can
afford
the
corruption
that
plagues
the
world
like
cancer
together
we
must
harness
the
power
of
open
societies
and
open
economies
why
partnered
with
countries
from
across
the
globe
to
launch
new
partnership
on
open
government
that
helps
ensure
accountability
and
helps
to
empower
citizens
no
country
should
deny
people
their
rights
to
freedom
of
and
freedom
of
religion
but
also
no
country
should
deny
people
their
rights
because
of
who
they
love
which
is
why
we
must
stand
up
for
the
rights
of
gays
and
lesbians
everywhere
and
no
country
can
its
potential
if
half
its
population
can
not
reach
theirs
this
week
the
united
states
signed
new
declaration
on
participation
next
year
we
should
each
announce
the
steps
we
are
taking
to
break
down
the
economic
and
political
barriers
that
stand
in
the
way
of
women
and
girls
this
is
what
our
commitment
to
human
progress
demands
know
no
straight
line
to
that
progress
no
single
path
to
success
we
come
from
different
cultures
and
carry
with
us
different
histories
but
let
us
never
forget
that
even
as
we
gather
here
as
heads
of
different
governments
we
represent
citizens
who
share
the
same
basic
aspirations
to
live
with
dignity
and
freedom
to
get
an
education
and
pursue
opportunity
to
love
our
families
and
love
and
worship
our
god
to
live
in
the
kind
of
peace
that
makes
life
worth
living
it
is
the
nature
of
our
imperfect
world
that
we
are
forced
to
learn
these
lessons
over
and
over
again
conflict
and
repression
will
endure
so
long
as
some
people
refuse
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
yet
that
is
precisely
why
we
have
built
institutions
like
this
to
bind
our
fates
together
to
help
us
ourselves
in
each
other
because
those
who
came
before
us
believed
that
peace
is
preferable
to
war
and
freedom
is
preferable
to
suppression
and
prosperity
is
preferable
to
poverty
the
message
that
comes
not
from
capitals
but
from
citizens
from
our
people
and
when
the
cornerstone
of
this
very
building
was
put
in
place
president
came
here
to
new
york
and
said
the
united
nations
is
essentially
an
expression
of
the
moral
nature
of
aspirations
the
moral
nature
of
aspirations
as
we
live
in
world
that
is
changing
at
breathtaking
pace
lesson
that
we
must
never
forget
peace
is
hard
but
we
know
that
it
is
possible
so
together
let
us
be
resolved
to
see
that
it
is
defined
by
our
hopes
and
not
by
our
fears
together
let
us
make
peace
but
peace
most
importantly
that
will
last
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
for
convening
this
meeting
to
address
task
that
must
be
the
work
of
all
of
us
supporting
the
people
of
libya
as
they
build
future
that
is
free
and
democratic
and
prosperous
and
want
to
thank
president
for
his
remarks
and
for
all
that
he
and
prime
minister
have
done
to
help
libya
reach
this
moment
to
all
the
heads
of
state
to
all
the
countries
represented
here
who
have
done
so
much
over
the
past
several
months
to
ensure
this
day
could
come
want
to
say
thank
you
as
well
today
the
libyan
people
are
writing
new
chapter
in
the
life
of
their
nation
after
four
decades
of
darkness
they
can
walk
the
streets
free
from
tyrant
they
are
making
their
voices
heard
in
new
newspapers
and
on
radio
and
television
in
public
squares
and
on
personal
launching
political
parties
and
civil
groups
to
shape
their
own
destiny
and
secure
their
universal
rights
and
here
at
the
united
nations
the
new
flag
of
free
libya
now
flies
among
the
community
of
nations
make
no
mistake
credit
for
the
liberation
of
libya
belongs
to
the
people
of
libya
it
was
libyan
men
and
women
and
children
who
took
to
the
streets
in
peaceful
protest
who
faced
down
the
tanks
and
endured
the
bullets
it
was
libyan
fighters
often
and
outnumbered
who
fought
pitched
battles
it
was
libyan
activists
in
the
underground
in
chat
rooms
in
mosques
who
kept
revolution
alive
even
after
some
of
the
world
had
given
up
hope
it
was
libyan
women
and
girls
who
hung
flags
and
smuggled
weapons
to
the
front
it
was
libyans
from
countries
around
the
world
including
my
own
who
rushed
home
to
help
even
though
they
too
risked
brutality
and
death
it
was
libyan
blood
that
was
spilled
and
sons
and
daughters
who
gave
their
lives
and
on
that
august
day
after
all
that
sacrifice
after
long
years
it
was
libyans
who
pushed
their
dictator
from
power
at
the
same
time
libya
is
lesson
in
what
the
international
community
can
achieve
when
we
stand
together
as
one
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
process
we
can
not
and
should
not
intervene
every
time
there
is
an
injustice
in
the
world
yet
also
true
that
there
are
times
where
the
world
could
have
and
should
have
summoned
the
will
to
prevent
the
killing
of
innocents
on
horrific
scale
and
we
are
forever
haunted
by
the
atrocities
that
we
did
not
prevent
and
the
lives
that
we
did
not
save
but
this
time
was
different
this
time
we
through
the
united
nations
found
the
courage
and
the
collective
will
to
act
when
the
old
regime
unleashed
campaign
of
terror
threatening
to
roll
back
the
democratic
tide
sweeping
the
region
we
acted
as
united
nations
and
we
acted
swiftly
broadening
sanctions
imposing
an
arms
embargo
the
united
states
led
the
effort
to
pass
historic
resolution
at
the
security
council
all
necessary
measures
to
protect
the
libyan
people
and
when
the
civilians
of
were
threatened
with
massacre
we
exercised
that
authority
our
international
coalition
stopped
the
regime
in
its
tracks
and
saved
countless
lives
and
gave
the
libyan
people
the
time
and
the
space
to
prevail
important
too
is
how
this
effort
succeeded
thanks
to
the
leadership
and
contributions
of
many
countries
the
united
states
was
proud
to
play
decisive
role
especially
in
the
early
days
and
then
in
supporting
capacity
but
remember
that
it
was
the
arab
league
that
appealed
for
action
it
was
the
most
effective
alliance
nato
led
military
coalition
of
nearly
nations
our
european
allies
especially
the
united
kingdom
and
france
and
denmark
and
norway
that
conducted
the
vast
majority
of
air
strikes
protecting
rebels
on
the
ground
it
was
arab
states
who
joined
the
coalition
as
equal
partners
and
been
the
united
nations
and
countries
including
tunisia
and
egypt
that
have
cared
for
the
libyans
in
the
urgent
humanitarian
effort
that
continues
today
this
is
how
the
international
community
should
work
in
the
century
more
nations
bearing
the
responsibility
and
the
costs
of
meeting
global
challenges
in
fact
this
is
the
very
purpose
of
this
united
nations
so
every
nation
represented
here
today
can
take
pride
in
the
innocent
lives
we
saved
and
in
helping
libyans
reclaim
their
country
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
now
even
as
we
speak
remnants
of
the
old
regime
continue
to
fight
difficult
days
are
still
ahead
but
one
thing
is
clear
the
future
of
libya
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
libyan
people
for
just
as
it
was
libyans
who
tore
down
the
old
order
it
will
be
libyans
who
build
their
new
nation
and
come
here
today
to
say
to
the
people
of
libya
just
as
the
world
stood
by
you
in
your
struggle
to
be
free
we
will
now
stand
with
you
in
your
struggle
to
the
peace
and
prosperity
that
freedom
can
bring
in
this
effort
you
will
have
friend
and
partner
in
the
united
states
of
america
today
can
announce
that
our
ambassador
is
on
his
way
back
to
tripoli
and
this
week
the
american
flag
that
was
lowered
before
our
embassy
was
attacked
will
be
raised
again
over
american
embassy
we
will
work
closely
with
the
new
support
mission
in
libya
and
with
the
nations
here
today
to
assist
the
libyan
people
in
the
hard
work
ahead
first
and
most
immediately
security
so
long
as
the
libyan
people
are
being
threatened
the
mission
to
protect
them
will
continue
and
those
still
holding
out
must
understand
the
old
regime
is
over
and
it
is
time
to
lay
down
your
arms
and
join
the
new
libya
as
this
happens
the
world
must
also
support
efforts
to
secure
dangerous
weapons
conventional
and
otherwise
and
bring
fighters
under
central
civilian
control
for
without
security
democracy
and
trade
and
investment
can
not
flourish
second
the
humanitarian
effort
the
transitional
national
council
has
been
working
quickly
to
restore
water
and
electricity
and
food
supplies
to
tripoli
but
for
many
libyans
each
day
is
still
struggle
to
recover
from
their
wounds
reunite
with
their
families
and
return
to
their
homes
and
even
after
the
guns
of
war
fall
silent
the
ravages
of
war
will
continue
so
our
efforts
to
assist
its
victims
must
continue
in
this
the
united
states
the
united
nations
will
play
key
role
and
along
with
our
partners
the
united
states
will
do
our
part
to
help
the
hungry
and
the
wounded
third
democratic
transition
that
is
peaceful
inclusive
and
just
president
has
just
reaffirmed
the
transitional
national
commitment
to
these
principles
and
the
united
nations
will
play
central
role
in
coordinating
international
support
for
this
effort
we
all
know
what
is
needed
transition
that
is
timely
new
laws
and
constitution
that
uphold
the
rule
of
law
political
parties
and
strong
civil
society
and
for
the
first
time
in
libyan
history
free
and
fair
elections
true
democracy
however
must
flow
from
its
citizens
so
as
libyans
rightly
seek
justice
for
past
crimes
let
it
be
done
in
spirit
of
reconciliation
and
not
reprisals
and
violence
as
libyans
draw
strength
from
their
faith
religion
rooted
in
peace
and
tolerance
let
there
be
rejection
of
violent
extremism
which
offers
nothing
but
death
and
destruction
as
libyans
rebuild
let
those
efforts
tap
the
experience
of
all
those
with
the
skills
to
contribute
including
the
many
africans
in
libya
and
as
libyans
forge
society
that
is
truly
just
let
it
enshrine
the
rights
and
role
of
women
at
all
levels
of
society
for
we
know
that
the
nations
that
uphold
the
human
rights
of
all
people
especially
their
women
are
ultimately
more
successful
and
more
prosperous
which
brings
me
to
the
final
area
where
the
world
must
stand
with
libya
and
that
is
restoring
prosperity
for
too
long
vast
riches
were
stolen
and
squandered
now
that
wealth
must
serve
its
rightful
owners
the
libyan
people
as
sanctions
are
lifted
as
the
united
states
and
the
international
community
unfreeze
more
libyan
assets
and
as
the
country
oil
production
is
restored
the
libyan
people
deserve
government
that
is
transparent
and
accountable
and
bound
by
the
libyan
students
and
entrepreneurs
who
have
forged
friendships
in
the
united
states
we
intend
to
build
new
partnerships
to
help
unleash
extraordinary
potential
now
none
of
this
will
be
easy
after
decades
of
iron
rule
by
one
man
it
will
take
time
to
build
the
institutions
needed
for
democratic
libya
sure
there
will
be
days
of
frustration
there
will
be
days
when
progress
is
slow
there
will
be
days
when
some
begin
to
wish
for
the
old
order
and
its
illusion
of
stability
and
some
in
the
world
may
ask
can
libya
succeed
but
if
we
have
learned
anything
these
many
months
it
is
this
underestimate
the
aspirations
and
the
will
of
the
libyan
people
so
want
to
conclude
by
speaking
directly
to
the
people
of
libya
your
task
may
be
new
the
journey
ahead
may
be
fraught
with
difficulty
but
everything
you
need
to
build
your
future
already
beats
in
the
heart
of
your
nation
the
same
courage
you
summoned
on
that
first
february
day
the
same
resilience
that
brought
you
back
out
the
next
day
and
the
next
even
as
you
lost
family
and
friends
and
the
same
unshakeable
determination
with
which
you
liberated
broke
the
siege
of
and
have
fought
through
the
coastal
plain
and
the
western
mountains
the
same
unwavering
conviction
that
said
no
turning
back
our
sons
and
daughters
deserve
to
be
free
in
the
days
after
tripoli
fell
people
rejoiced
in
the
streets
and
pondered
the
role
ahead
and
one
of
those
libyans
said
have
this
chance
now
to
do
something
good
for
our
country
chance
we
have
dreamed
of
for
so
so
to
the
libyan
people
this
is
your
chance
and
today
the
world
is
saying
with
one
unmistakable
voice
we
will
stand
with
you
as
you
seize
this
moment
of
promise
as
you
reach
for
the
freedom
the
dignity
and
the
opportunity
that
you
deserve
so
congratulations
and
thank
you
very
much
good
morning
everybody
please
have
seat
week
ago
today
sent
congress
the
american
jobs
act
plan
that
will
lead
to
new
jobs
for
teachers
for
construction
workers
for
veterans
and
for
the
unemployed
it
will
cut
taxes
for
every
small
business
owner
and
virtually
every
working
man
and
woman
in
america
and
the
proposals
in
this
jobs
bill
are
the
kinds
that
have
been
supported
by
democrats
and
republicans
in
the
past
so
there
be
any
reason
for
congress
to
drag
its
feet
they
should
pass
it
right
away
ready
to
sign
bill
got
the
pens
all
ready
now
as
said
before
congress
should
pass
this
bill
knowing
that
every
proposal
is
fully
paid
for
the
american
jobs
act
will
not
add
to
our
debt
and
today
releasing
plan
that
details
how
to
pay
for
the
jobs
bill
while
also
paying
down
our
debt
over
time
and
this
is
important
because
the
health
of
our
economy
depends
in
part
on
what
we
do
right
now
to
create
the
conditions
where
businesses
can
hire
and
families
can
feel
basic
measure
of
economic
security
but
in
the
long
run
our
prosperity
also
depends
on
our
ability
to
pay
down
the
massive
debt
accumulated
over
the
past
decade
in
way
that
allows
us
to
meet
our
responsibilities
to
each
other
and
to
the
future
during
this
past
decade
profligate
spending
in
washington
tax
cuts
for
and
billionaires
the
cost
of
two
wars
and
the
recession
turned
record
surplus
into
yawning
deficit
and
that
left
us
with
big
pile
of
if
we
act
that
burden
will
ultimately
fall
on
our
shoulders
if
we
act
the
growing
debt
will
eventually
crowd
out
everything
else
preventing
us
from
investing
in
things
like
education
or
sustaining
programs
like
so
washington
has
to
live
within
its
means
the
government
has
to
do
what
families
across
this
country
have
been
doing
for
years
we
have
to
cut
what
we
afford
to
pay
for
what
really
matters
we
need
to
invest
in
what
will
promote
hiring
and
economic
growth
now
while
still
providing
the
confidence
that
will
come
with
plan
that
reduces
our
deficits
over
the
these
principles
were
at
the
heart
of
the
deficit
framework
that
put
forward
in
april
it
was
an
approach
to
shrink
the
deficit
as
share
of
the
economy
but
not
to
do
so
so
abruptly
with
spending
cuts
that
would
hamper
growth
or
prevent
us
from
helping
small
businesses
and
families
get
back
on
their
feet
it
was
an
approach
that
said
we
need
to
go
through
the
budget
looking
for
waste
without
education
and
basic
scientific
research
and
road
construction
because
those
things
are
essential
to
our
future
and
it
was
an
approach
that
said
we
should
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
the
poor
and
the
middle
class
that
for
us
to
solve
this
problem
everybody
including
the
wealthiest
americans
and
biggest
corporations
have
to
pay
their
fair
share
now
during
the
debt
ceiling
debate
had
hoped
to
negotiate
compromise
with
the
speaker
of
the
house
that
fulfilled
these
principles
and
achieved
the
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
that
leaders
in
both
parties
have
agreed
we
need
grand
bargain
that
would
have
strengthened
our
economy
instead
of
weakened
it
unfortunately
the
speaker
walked
away
from
balanced
package
what
we
agreed
to
instead
all
that
grand
but
it
was
start
roughly
trillion
in
cuts
to
domestic
spending
and
spending
everyone
knows
we
have
to
do
more
and
special
joint
committee
of
congress
is
assigned
to
find
more
deficit
reduction
so
today
laying
out
set
of
specific
proposals
to
finish
what
we
started
this
summer
proposals
that
live
up
to
the
principles
talked
about
from
the
beginning
plan
that
reduces
our
debt
by
more
than
trillion
and
achieves
these
savings
in
way
that
is
fair
by
asking
everybody
to
do
their
part
so
that
no
one
has
to
bear
too
much
of
the
burden
on
their
own
all
told
this
plan
cuts
in
spending
for
every
dollar
in
new
revenues
in
addition
to
the
trillion
in
spending
that
already
cut
from
the
budget
our
plan
makes
additional
spending
cuts
that
need
to
happen
if
to
solve
this
problem
we
reform
agricultural
subsidies
subsidies
that
lot
of
times
pay
large
farms
for
crops
that
they
do
grow
we
make
modest
adjustments
to
federal
retirement
programs
we
reduce
by
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
the
tax
money
that
goes
to
and
mac
we
also
ask
the
largest
financial
firms
companies
saved
by
tax
dollars
during
the
financial
crisis
to
repay
the
american
people
for
every
dime
that
we
spent
and
we
save
an
additional
trillion
as
we
end
the
wars
in
iraq
and
these
savings
are
not
only
counted
as
part
of
our
plan
but
as
part
of
the
budget
plan
that
nearly
every
republican
on
the
house
voted
for
finally
this
plan
includes
structural
reforms
to
reduce
the
cost
of
health
care
in
programs
like
and
keep
in
mind
we
already
included
number
of
reforms
in
the
health
care
law
which
will
go
long
way
towards
controlling
these
costs
but
we
going
to
have
to
do
little
more
this
plan
reduces
wasteful
subsidies
and
erroneous
payments
while
changing
some
incentives
that
often
lead
to
excessive
health
care
costs
it
makes
prescriptions
more
affordable
through
faster
approval
of
generic
drugs
work
with
governors
to
make
more
efficient
and
more
accountable
and
change
the
way
we
pay
for
health
care
instead
of
just
paying
for
procedures
providers
will
be
paid
more
when
they
improve
results
and
such
steps
will
save
money
and
improve
care
these
changes
are
phased
in
slowly
to
strengthen
and
over
time
because
while
we
do
need
to
reduce
health
care
costs
not
going
to
allow
that
to
be
an
excuse
for
turning
into
voucher
program
that
leaves
seniors
at
the
mercy
of
the
insurance
industry
and
not
going
to
stand
for
balancing
the
budget
by
denying
or
reducing
health
care
for
poor
children
or
those
with
disabilities
so
we
will
reform
and
but
we
will
not
abandon
the
fundamental
commitment
that
this
country
has
kept
for
generations
and
by
the
way
that
includes
our
commitment
to
social
security
said
before
social
security
is
not
the
primary
cause
of
our
deficits
but
it
does
face
challenges
as
our
country
grows
older
and
both
parties
are
going
to
need
to
work
together
on
separate
track
to
strengthen
social
security
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
so
this
is
how
we
can
reduce
spending
by
scouring
the
budget
for
every
dime
of
waste
and
inefficiency
by
reforming
government
spending
and
by
making
modest
adjustments
to
and
but
all
these
reductions
in
spending
by
themselves
will
not
solve
our
fiscal
problems
we
just
cut
our
way
out
of
this
hole
going
to
take
balanced
approach
if
going
to
make
spending
cuts
many
of
which
we
make
if
we
facing
such
large
budget
deficits
then
only
right
that
we
ask
everyone
to
pay
their
fair
share
you
know
last
week
speaker
of
the
house
john
gave
about
the
economy
and
to
his
credit
he
made
the
point
that
we
afford
the
kind
of
politics
that
says
way
or
the
was
encouraged
by
that
the
problem
in
that
same
he
also
came
out
against
any
plan
to
cut
the
deficit
that
includes
any
additional
revenues
whatsoever
he
said
quoting
him
there
is
one
and
that
option
and
only
option
relies
entirely
on
cuts
that
means
slashing
education
surrendering
the
research
necessary
to
keep
technological
edge
in
the
century
and
allowing
our
critical
public
assets
like
highways
and
bridges
and
airports
to
get
worse
it
would
cripple
our
and
our
ability
to
win
the
jobs
of
the
future
and
it
would
also
mean
asking
sacrifice
of
seniors
and
the
middle
class
and
the
poor
while
asking
nothing
of
the
wealthiest
americans
and
biggest
corporations
so
the
speaker
says
we
have
it
my
way
or
the
highway
and
then
basically
says
my
way
or
the
highway
not
smart
not
right
if
going
to
meet
our
responsibilities
we
have
to
do
it
together
now
proposing
real
serious
cuts
in
spending
when
you
include
the
trillion
in
cuts
already
signed
into
law
these
would
be
among
the
biggest
cuts
in
spending
in
our
history
but
got
to
be
part
of
larger
plan
balanced
plan
that
asks
the
most
fortunate
among
us
to
pay
their
fair
share
just
like
everybody
else
and
why
this
plan
eliminates
tax
loopholes
that
primarily
go
to
the
wealthiest
taxpayers
and
biggest
corporations
tax
breaks
that
small
businesses
and
families
get
and
if
tax
reform
does
get
done
this
plan
asks
the
wealthiest
americans
to
go
back
to
paying
the
same
rates
that
they
paid
during
the
before
the
bush
tax
cuts
promise
not
because
anybody
looks
forward
to
the
prospects
of
raising
taxes
or
paying
more
taxes
in
fact
cut
taxes
for
the
middle
class
and
for
small
businesses
and
through
the
american
jobs
act
cut
taxes
again
to
promote
hiring
and
put
more
money
into
the
pockets
of
people
but
we
afford
these
special
lower
rates
for
the
wealthy
rates
by
the
way
that
were
meant
to
be
temporary
back
when
these
first
these
tax
cuts
back
in
were
being
talked
about
they
were
talked
about
temporary
measures
we
afford
them
when
running
these
big
deficits
now
am
also
ready
to
work
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
reform
our
entire
tax
code
to
get
rid
of
the
decades
of
accumulated
loopholes
special
interest
and
other
tax
expenditures
that
stack
the
deck
against
small
business
owners
and
ordinary
families
who
afford
washington
lobbyists
or
fancy
accountants
our
tax
code
is
more
than
pages
long
if
you
stack
up
all
the
volumes
almost
five
feet
tall
that
means
that
how
much
you
pay
often
depends
less
on
what
you
make
and
more
on
how
well
you
can
game
the
system
and
that
especially
true
of
the
corporate
tax
code
got
one
of
the
highest
corporate
tax
rates
in
the
world
but
riddled
with
exceptions
and
special
interest
loopholes
so
some
companies
get
out
paying
lot
of
taxes
while
the
rest
of
them
end
up
having
to
foot
the
bill
and
this
makes
our
entire
economy
less
competitive
and
our
country
less
desirable
place
to
do
business
that
has
to
change
our
tax
code
give
an
advantage
to
companies
with
the
lobbyists
it
should
give
an
advantage
to
companies
that
invest
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
create
jobs
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
we
can
lower
the
corporate
rate
if
we
get
rid
of
all
these
special
deals
so
am
ready
am
eager
to
work
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
reform
the
tax
code
to
make
it
simpler
make
it
fairer
and
make
america
more
competitive
but
any
reform
plan
will
have
to
raise
revenue
to
help
close
our
deficit
that
has
to
be
part
of
the
formula
and
any
reform
should
follow
another
simple
principle
families
pay
higher
taxes
than
millionaires
and
billionaires
pretty
straightforward
hard
to
argue
against
that
warren
secretary
pay
higher
tax
rate
than
warren
there
is
no
justification
for
it
it
is
wrong
that
in
the
united
states
of
america
teacher
or
nurse
or
construction
worker
who
earns
should
pay
higher
tax
rates
than
somebody
pulling
in
million
anybody
who
says
we
change
the
tax
code
to
correct
that
anyone
who
has
signed
some
pledge
to
protect
every
single
tax
loophole
so
long
as
they
live
they
should
be
called
out
they
should
have
to
defend
that
unfairness
explain
why
somebody
who
making
million
year
in
the
financial
markets
should
be
paying
percent
on
their
taxes
when
teacher
making
year
is
paying
more
than
that
paying
higher
rate
they
ought
to
have
to
answer
for
it
and
if
pledged
to
keep
that
kind
of
unfairness
in
place
they
should
remember
the
last
time
checked
the
only
pledge
that
really
matters
is
the
pledge
we
take
to
uphold
the
constitution
now
already
hearing
the
usual
defenders
of
these
kinds
of
loopholes
saying
this
is
just
reject
the
idea
that
asking
hedge
fund
manager
to
pay
the
same
tax
rate
as
plumber
or
teacher
is
class
warfare
think
just
the
right
the
thing
to
do
believe
the
american
middle
class
who
been
pressured
relentlessly
for
decades
believe
time
that
they
were
fought
for
as
hard
as
the
lobbyists
and
some
lawmakers
have
fought
to
protect
special
treatment
for
billionaires
and
big
corporations
nobody
wants
to
punish
success
in
america
great
about
this
country
is
our
belief
that
anyone
can
make
it
and
everybody
should
be
able
to
try
the
idea
that
any
one
of
us
can
open
business
or
have
an
idea
and
make
us
millionaires
or
billionaires
this
is
the
land
of
opportunity
great
all
saying
is
that
those
who
have
done
well
including
me
should
pay
our
fair
share
in
taxes
to
contribute
to
the
nation
that
made
our
success
possible
we
get
better
deal
than
ordinary
families
get
and
think
most
wealthy
americans
would
agree
if
they
knew
this
would
help
us
grow
the
economy
and
deal
with
the
debt
that
threatens
our
future
it
comes
down
to
this
we
have
to
both
parties
agree
that
we
need
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
the
same
amount
by
trillion
so
what
choices
are
we
going
to
make
to
reach
that
goal
either
we
ask
the
wealthiest
americans
to
pay
their
fair
share
in
taxes
or
going
to
have
to
ask
seniors
to
pay
more
for
we
afford
to
do
both
either
we
gut
education
and
medical
research
or
got
to
reform
the
tax
code
so
that
the
most
profitable
corporations
have
to
give
up
tax
loopholes
that
other
companies
get
we
afford
to
do
both
this
is
not
class
warfare
math
the
money
is
going
to
have
to
come
from
and
if
not
willing
to
ask
those
who
done
extraordinarily
well
to
help
america
close
the
deficit
and
we
are
trying
to
reach
that
same
target
of
trillion
then
the
logic
the
math
says
everybody
else
has
to
do
whole
lot
more
got
to
put
the
entire
burden
on
the
middle
class
and
the
poor
got
to
scale
back
on
the
investments
that
have
always
helped
our
economy
grow
got
to
settle
for
roads
and
bridges
and
airports
and
schools
that
are
crumbling
unacceptable
to
me
unacceptable
to
the
american
people
and
it
will
not
happen
on
my
watch
will
not
support
will
not
support
any
plan
that
puts
all
the
burden
for
closing
our
deficit
on
ordinary
americans
and
will
veto
any
bill
that
changes
benefits
for
those
who
rely
on
but
does
not
raise
serious
revenues
by
asking
the
wealthiest
americans
or
biggest
corporations
to
pay
their
fair
share
we
are
not
going
to
have
deal
that
hurts
the
folks
who
are
most
vulnerable
none
of
the
changes
proposing
are
easy
or
politically
convenient
always
more
popular
to
promise
the
moon
and
leave
the
bill
for
after
the
next
election
or
the
election
after
that
been
true
since
our
founding
george
washington
grappled
with
this
problem
he
said
the
payment
of
debts
there
must
be
revenue
that
to
have
revenue
there
must
be
taxes
and
no
taxes
can
be
devised
which
are
not
more
or
less
inconvenient
and
he
understood
that
dealing
with
the
debt
is
these
are
his
words
choice
of
but
he
also
knew
that
public
servants
elected
to
do
what
was
easy
they
elected
to
do
what
was
politically
advantageous
our
responsibility
to
put
country
before
party
our
responsibility
to
do
right
for
the
future
and
what
this
debate
is
about
not
about
numbers
on
ledger
not
about
figures
on
spreadsheet
about
the
economic
future
of
this
country
and
about
whether
we
will
do
what
it
takes
to
create
jobs
and
growth
and
opportunity
while
facing
up
to
the
legacy
of
debt
that
threatens
everything
built
over
generations
and
also
about
fairness
about
whether
we
are
in
fact
in
this
together
and
looking
out
for
one
another
we
know
right
time
to
do
right
thank
you
very
much
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
and
fellow
americans
tonight
we
meet
at
an
urgent
time
for
our
country
we
continue
to
face
an
economic
crisis
that
has
left
millions
of
our
jobless
and
political
crisis
made
things
worse
this
past
week
reporters
have
been
asking
will
this
mean
for
the
president
what
will
it
mean
for
congress
how
will
it
affect
their
polls
and
the
next
election
but
the
millions
of
americans
who
are
watching
right
now
they
care
about
politics
they
have
concerns
many
have
spent
months
looking
for
work
others
are
doing
their
best
just
to
scrape
by
giving
up
nights
out
with
the
family
to
save
on
gas
or
make
the
mortgage
postponing
retirement
to
send
kid
to
college
these
men
and
women
grew
up
with
faith
in
an
america
where
hard
work
and
responsibility
paid
off
they
believed
in
country
where
everyone
gets
fair
shake
and
does
their
fair
share
where
if
you
stepped
up
did
your
job
and
were
loyal
to
your
company
that
loyalty
would
be
rewarded
with
decent
salary
and
good
benefits
maybe
raise
once
in
while
if
you
did
the
right
thing
you
could
make
it
anybody
could
make
it
in
america
for
decades
now
americans
have
watched
that
compact
erode
they
have
seen
the
decks
too
often
stacked
against
them
and
they
know
that
washington
has
not
always
put
their
interests
first
the
people
of
this
country
work
hard
to
meet
their
responsibilities
the
question
tonight
is
whether
meet
ours
the
question
is
whether
in
the
face
of
an
ongoing
national
crisis
we
can
stop
the
political
circus
and
actually
do
something
to
help
the
economy
the
question
is
the
question
is
whether
we
can
restore
some
of
the
fairness
and
security
that
has
defined
this
nation
since
our
beginning
those
of
us
here
tonight
solve
all
our
woes
ultimately
our
recovery
will
be
driven
not
by
washington
but
by
our
businesses
and
our
workers
but
we
can
help
we
can
make
difference
there
are
steps
we
can
take
right
now
to
improve
lives
am
sending
this
congress
plan
that
you
should
pass
right
away
called
the
american
jobs
act
there
should
be
nothing
controversial
about
this
piece
of
legislation
everything
in
here
is
the
kind
of
proposal
been
supported
by
both
democrats
and
republicans
including
many
who
sit
here

and
everything
in
this
bill
will
be
paid

jobs
for
veterans
and
more
jobs
for
unemployed
it
will
provide

provide
tax
break
for
companies
who
hire
new
workers
and
it
will
cut
payroll
taxes
in
half
for
every
working
american
and
every
small
business
it
will
provide
jolt
to
an
economy
that
has
stalled
and
give
companies
confidence
that
if
they
invest
and
if
they
hire
there
will
be
customers
for
their
products
and
services
you
should
pass
this
jobs
plan
right
away
everyone
here
knows
that
small
businesses
are
where
most
new
jobs
begin
and
you
know
that
while
corporate
profits
have
come
roaring
back
smaller
companies
so
for
everyone
who
speaks
so
passionately
about
making
life
easier
for
creators
this
plan
is
for
you
pass
this
jobs
bill
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
starting
tomorrow
small
businesses
will
get
tax
cut
if
they
hire
new
workers
or
if
they
raise
wages
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
all
small
business
owners
will
also
see
their
payroll
taxes
cut
in
half
next
year
if
you
have
employees
if
you
have
employees
making
an
average
salary
an
tax
cut
and
all
businesses
will
be
able
to
continue
writing
off
the
investments
they
make
in
not
just
democrats
who
have
supported
this
kind
of
proposal
fifty
house
republicans
have
proposed
the
same
payroll
tax
cut
in
this
plan
you
should
pass
it
right
away
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
we
can
put
people
to
work
rebuilding
america
everyone
here
knows
we
have
badly
decaying
roads
and
bridges
all
over
the
country
our
highways
are
clogged
with
traffic
our
skies
are
the
most
congested
in
the
world
an
outrage
building
transportation
system
is
part
of
what
made
us
economic
superpower
and
now
going
to
sit
back
and
watch
china
build
newer
airports
and
faster
at
time
when
millions
of
unemployed
construction
workers
could
build
them
right
here
in
america
there
are
private
construction
companies
all
across
america
just
waiting
to
get
to
work
bridge
that
needs
repair
between
ohio
and
kentucky
on
one
of
the
busiest
routes
in
north
america
public
transit
project
in
houston
that
will
help
clear
up
one
of
the
worst
areas
of
traffic
in
the
country
and
there
are
schools
throughout
this
country
that
desperately
need
renovating
how
can
we
expect
our
kids
to
do
their
best
in
places
that
are
literally
falling
apart
this
is
america
every
child
deserves
great
school
and
we
can
give
it
to
them
if
we
act
now
the
american
jobs
act
will
repair
and
at
least
schools
it
will
put
people
to
work
right
now
fixing
roofs
and
windows
installing
science
labs
and
internet
in
classrooms
all
across
this
country
it
will
rehabilitate
homes
and
businesses
in
communities
hit
hardest
by
it
will
jumpstart
thousands
of
transportation
projects
all
across
the
country
and
to
make
sure
the
money
is
properly
spent
building
on
reforms
already
put
in
place
no
more
no
more
no
more
bridges
to
nowhere
cutting
the
red
tape
that
prevents
some
of
these
projects
from
getting
started
as
quickly
as
possible
and
set
up
an
independent
fund
to
attract
private
dollars
and
issue
loans
based
on
two
criteria
how
badly
construction
project
is
needed
and
how
much
good
it
will
do
for
the
economy
this
idea
came
from
bill
written
by
texas
republican
and
democrat
the
idea
for
big
boost
in
construction
is
supported
by
largest
business
and
largest
the
kind
of
proposal
been
supported
in
the
past
by
democrats
and
republicans
alike
you
should
pass
it
right
away
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
thousands
of
teachers
in
every
state
will
go
back
to
work
these
are
the
men
and
women
charged
with
preparing
our
children
for
world
where
the
competition
has
never
been
tougher
but
while
adding
teachers
in
places
like
south
korea
laying
them
off
in
droves
unfair
to
our
kids
it
undermines
their
future
and
ours
and
it
has
to
stop
pass
this
bill
and
put
our
teachers
back
in
the
classroom
where
they
belong
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
companies
will
get
extra
tax
credits
if
they
hire
veterans
we
ask
these
men
and
women
to
leave
their
careers
leave
their
families
risk
their
lives
to
fight
for
our
country
the
last
thing
they
should
have
to
do
is
fight
for
job
when
they
come
home
pass
this
bill
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
disadvantaged
young
people
will
have
the
hope
and
the
dignity
of
summer
job
next
year
and
their
parents
their
parents
americans
who
desperately
want
to
work
will
have
more
ladders
out
of
poverty
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
companies
will
get
tax
credit
if
they
hire
anyone
who
has
spent
more
than
six
months
looking
for
job
we
have
to
do
more
to
help
the
unemployed
in
their
search
for
work
this
jobs
plan
builds
on
program
in
georgia
that
several
republican
leaders
have
highlighted
where
people
who
collect
unemployment
insurance
participate
in
temporary
work
as
way
to
build
their
skills
while
they
look
for
permanent
job
the
plan
also
extends
unemployment
insurance
for
another
year
if
the
millions
of
unemployed
americans
stopped
getting
this
insurance
and
stopped
using
that
money
for
basic
necessities
it
would
be
devastating
blow
to
this
economy
democrats
and
republicans
in
this
chamber
have
supported
unemployment
insurance
plenty
of
times
in
the
past
and
in
this
time
of
prolonged
hardship
you
should
pass
it
again
right
away
pass
this
jobs
bill
and
the
typical
working
family
will
get
tax
cut
next
year
fifteen
hundred
dollars
that
would
have
been
taken
out
of
your
pocket
will
go
into
your
pocket
this
expands
on
the
tax
cut
that
democrats
and
republicans
already
passed
for
this
year
if
we
allow
that
tax
cut
to
expire
if
we
refuse
to
act
families
will
get
hit
with
tax
increase
at
the
worst
possible
time
we
let
that
happen
know
that
some
of
you
have
sworn
oaths
to
never
raise
any
taxes
on
anyone
for
as
long
as
you
live
now
is
not
the
time
to
carve
out
an
exception
and
raise
taxes
which
is
why
you
should
pass
this
bill
right
away
this
is
the
american
jobs
act
it
will
lead
to
new
jobs
for
construction
workers
for
teachers
for
veterans
for
first
responders
young
people
and
the
unemployed
it
will
provide
tax
credits
to
companies
that
hire
new
workers
tax
relief
to
small
business
owners
and
tax
cuts
for
the
middle
class
and
the
other
thing
want
the
american
people
to
know
the
american
jobs
act
will
not
add
to
the
deficit
it
will
be
paid
for
and
how
the
agreement
we
passed
in
july
will
cut
government
spending
by
about
trillion
over
the
next
years
it
also
charges
this
congress
to
come
up
with
an
additional
trillion
in
savings
by
tonight
am
asking
you
to
increase
that
amount
so
that
it
covers
the
full
cost
of
the
american
jobs
act
and
week
from
monday
be
releasing
more
ambitious
deficit
plan
plan
that
will
not
only
cover
the
cost
of
this
jobs
bill
but
our
debt
in
the
long
run
this
approach
is
basically
the
one
been
advocating
for
months
in
addition
to
the
trillion
dollars
of
spending
cuts
already
signed
into
law
balanced
plan
that
would
reduce
the
deficit
by
making
additional
spending
cuts
by
making
modest
adjustments
to
health
care
programs
like
and
and
by
reforming
our
tax
code
in
way
that
asks
the
wealthiest
americans
and
biggest
corporations
to
pay
their
fair
share
more
the
spending
cuts
happen
so
abruptly
that
be
drag
on
our
economy
or
prevent
us
from
helping
small
businesses
and
families
get
back
on
their
feet
right
away
now
there
are
some
in
my
party
who
think
we
should
make
any
changes
at
all
to
and
and
understand
their
concerns
but
the
truth
millions
of
americans
rely
on
in
their
retirement
and
millions
more
will
do
so
in
the
future
they
pay
for
this
benefit
during
their
working
years
they
earn
it
but
with
an
aging
population
and
rising
health
care
costs
we
are
spending
too
fast
to
sustain
the
program
and
if
we
gradually
reform
the
system
while
protecting
current
beneficiaries
it
be
there
when
future
need
it
we
have
to
reform
to
strengthen
it
am
also
also
well
aware
that
there
are
many
republicans
who
believe
we
should
raise
taxes
on
those
who
are
most
fortunate
and
can
best
afford
it
but
here
is
what
every
american
knows
while
most
people
in
this
country
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
few
of
the
most
affluent
citizens
and
most
profitable
corporations
enjoy
tax
breaks
and
loopholes
that
nobody
else
gets
right
now
warren
pays
lower
tax
rate
than
his
secretary
an
outrage
he
has
asked
us
to
fix
we
need
tax
code
where
everyone
gets
fair
shake
and
where
everybody
pays
their
fair
share
and
by
the
way
believe
the
vast
majority
of
wealthy
americans
and
are
willing
to
do
just
that
if
it
helps
the
economy
grow
and
gets
our
fiscal
house
in
order
also
offer
ideas
to
reform
corporate
tax
code
that
stands
as
monument
to
special
interest
influence
in
washington
by
eliminating
pages
of
loopholes
and
deductions
we
can
lower
one
of
the
highest
corporate
tax
rates
in
the
world
our
tax
code
should
not
give
an
advantage
to
companies
that
can
afford
the
lobbyists
it
should
give
an
advantage
to
companies
that
invest
and
create
jobs
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
so
we
can
reduce
this
deficit
pay
down
our
debt
and
pay
for
this
jobs
plan
in
the
process
but
in
order
to
do
this
we
have
to
decide
what
our
priorities
are
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
the
best
way
to
grow
the
economy
and
create
jobs
should
we
keep
tax
loopholes
for
oil
companies
or
should
we
use
that
money
to
give
small
business
owners
tax
credit
when
they
hire
new
workers
because
we
afford
to
do
both
should
we
keep
tax
breaks
for
millionaires
and
billionaires
or
should
we
put
teachers
back
to
work
so
our
kids
can
graduate
ready
for
college
and
good
jobs
right
now
we
afford
to
do
both
this
political
this
class
warfare
this
is
simple
math
this
is
simple
math
these
are
real
choices
these
are
real
choices
that
got
to
make
and
pretty
sure
know
what
most
americans
would
choose
not
even
close
and
time
for
us
to
do
right
for
our
future
now
the
american
jobs
act
answers
the
urgent
need
to
create
jobs
right
away
but
we
stop
there
as
argued
since
ran
for
this
office
we
have
to
look
beyond
the
immediate
crisis
and
start
building
an
economy
that
lasts
into
the
future
an
economy
that
creates
good
jobs
that
pay
well
and
offer
security
we
now
live
in
world
where
technology
has
made
it
possible
for
companies
to
take
their
business
anywhere
if
we
want
them
to
start
here
and
stay
here
and
hire
here
we
have
to
be
able
to
and
and
every
other
country
on
earth
and
this
task
of
making
america
more
competitive
for
the
long
haul
job
for
all
of
us
for
government
and
for
private
companies
for
states
and
for
local
communities
and
for
every
american
citizen
all
of
us
will
have
to
up
our
game
all
of
us
will
have
to
change
the
way
we
do
business
my
administration
can
and
will
take
some
steps
to
improve
our
competitiveness
on
our
own
for
example
if
small
business
owner
who
has
contract
with
the
federal
government
going
to
make
sure
you
get
paid
lot
faster
than
you
do
right
now
also
planning
to
cut
away
the
red
tape
that
prevents
too
many
rapidly
growing
startup
companies
from
raising
capital
and
going
public
and
to
help
responsible
homeowners
going
to
work
with
federal
housing
agencies
to
help
more
people
refinance
their
mortgages
at
interest
rates
that
are
now
near
percent
step
know
you
guys
must
be
for
this
because
step
that
can
put
more
than
year
in
pocket
and
give
lift
to
an
economy
still
burdened
by
the
drop
in
housing
prices
so
some
things
we
can
do
on
our
own
other
steps
will
require
congressional
action
today
you
passed
reform
that
will
speed
up
the
outdated
patent
process
so
that
entrepreneurs
can
turn
new
idea
into
new
business
as
quickly
as
possible
the
kind
of
action
we
need
now
time
to
clear
the
way
for
series
of
trade
agreements
that
would
make
it
easier
for
american
companies
to
sell
their
products
in
panama
and
and
south
korea
while
also
helping
the
workers
whose
jobs
have
been
affected
by
global
competition
if
americans
can
buy
and
want
to
see
folks
in
south
korea
driving
fords
and
and
want
to
see
more
products
sold
around
the
world
stamped
with
the
three
proud
words
in
what
we
need
to
get
done
and
on
all
of
our
efforts
to
strengthen
competitiveness
we
need
to
look
for
ways
to
work
side
by
side
with
businesses
why
brought
together
jobs
council
of
leaders
from
different
industries
who
are
developing
wide
range
of
new
ideas
to
help
companies
grow
and
create
jobs
already
business
leaders
to
train
american
engineers
year
by
providing
company
and
training
other
businesses
are
covering
tuition
for
workers
who
learn
new
skills
at
community
colleges
and
going
to
make
sure
the
next
generation
of
manufacturing
takes
root
not
in
china
or
europe
but
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
if
we
provide
the
right
incentives
the
right
support
and
if
we
make
sure
our
trading
partners
play
by
the
rules
we
can
be
the
ones
to
build
everything
from
cars
to
advanced
to
semiconductors
that
we
sell
all
around
the
world
how
america
can
be
number
one
again
and
how
america
will
be
number
one
again
now
that
some
of
you
have
different
theory
on
how
to
grow
the
economy
some
of
you
sincerely
believe
that
the
only
solution
to
our
economic
challenges
is
to
simply
cut
most
government
spending
and
eliminate
most
government
regulations
well
agree
that
we
afford
wasteful
spending
and
work
with
you
with
congress
to
root
it
out
and
agree
that
there
are
some
rules
and
regulations
that
do
put
an
unnecessary
burden
on
businesses
at
time
when
they
can
least
afford
it
why
ordered
review
of
all
government
regulations
so
far
identified
over
reforms
which
will
save
billions
of
dollars
over
the
next
few
years
we
should
have
no
more
regulation
than
the
health
safety
and
security
of
the
american
people
require
every
rule
should
meet
that
test
but
what
we
do
what
will
not
do
is
let
this
economic
crisis
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
wipe
out
the
basic
protections
that
americans
have
counted
on
for
decades
reject
the
idea
that
we
need
to
ask
people
to
choose
between
their
jobs
and
their
safety
reject
the
argument
that
says
for
the
economy
to
grow
we
have
to
roll
back
protections
that
ban
hidden
fees
by
credit
card
companies
or
rules
that
keep
our
kids
from
being
exposed
to
mercury
or
laws
that
prevent
the
health
insurance
industry
from
patients
reject
the
idea
that
we
have
to
strip
away
collective
bargaining
rights
to
compete
in
global
economy
we
be
in
race
to
the
bottom
where
we
try
to
offer
the
cheapest
and
the
worst
pollution
standards
america
should
be
in
race
to
the
top
and
believe
we
can
win
that
race
in
fact
this
larger
notion
that
the
only
thing
we
can
do
to
restore
prosperity
is
just
dismantle
government
refund
money
and
let
everyone
write
their
own
rules
and
tell
everyone
on
their
own
not
who
we
are
not
the
story
of
america
yes
we
are
rugged
individualists
yes
we
are
strong
and
and
it
has
been
the
drive
and
initiative
of
our
workers
and
entrepreneurs
that
has
made
this
economy
the
engine
and
the
envy
of
the
world
but
always
been
another
thread
running
throughout
our
history
belief
that
all
connected
and
that
there
are
some
things
we
can
only
do
together
as
nation
we
all
remember
abraham
lincoln
as
the
leader
who
saved
our
union
founder
of
the
republican
party
but
in
the
middle
of
civil
war
he
was
also
leader
who
looked
to
the
future
republican
president
who
government
to
build
the
transcontinental
railroad
launch
the
national
academy
of
sciences
set
up
the
first
land
grant
colleges
and
leaders
of
both
parties
have
followed
the
example
he
set
ask
yourselves
where
would
we
be
right
now
if
the
people
who
sat
here
before
us
decided
not
to
build
our
highways
not
to
build
our
bridges
our
dams
our
airports
what
would
this
country
be
like
if
we
had
chosen
not
to
spend
money
on
public
high
schools
or
research
universities
or
community
colleges
millions
of
returning
including
my
grandfather
had
the
opportunity
to
go
to
school
because
of
the
bill
where
would
we
be
if
they
had
that
chance
how
many
jobs
would
it
have
cost
us
if
past
congresses
decided
not
to
support
the
basic
research
that
led
to
the
internet
and
the
computer
chip
what
kind
of
country
would
this
be
if
this
chamber
had
voted
down
social
security
or
just
because
it
violated
some
rigid
idea
about
what
government
could
or
could
not
do
how
many
americans
would
have
suffered
as
result
no
single
individual
built
america
on
their
own
we
built
it
together
we
have
been
and
always
will
be
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all
nation
with
responsibilities
to
ourselves
and
with
responsibilities
to
one
another
and
members
of
congress
it
is
time
for
us
to
meet
our
responsibilities
every
proposal
laid
out
tonight
is
the
kind
been
supported
by
democrats
and
republicans
in
the
past
every
proposal
laid
out
tonight
will
be
paid
for
and
every
proposal
is
designed
to
meet
the
urgent
needs
of
our
people
and
our
communities
now
know
been
lot
of
about
whether
the
politics
of
the
moment
will
allow
us
to
pass
this
jobs
plan
or
any
jobs
plan
already
seeing
the
same
old
press
releases
and
tweets
flying
back
and
forth
already
the
media
has
proclaimed
that
impossible
to
bridge
our
differences
and
maybe
some
of
you
have
decided
that
those
differences
are
so
great
that
we
can
only
resolve
them
at
the
ballot
box
but
know
this
the
next
election
is
months
away
and
the
people
who
sent
us
here
the
people
who
hired
us
to
work
for
them
they
have
the
luxury
of
waiting
months
some
of
them
are
living
week
to
week
to
even
day
to
day
they
need
help
and
they
need
it
now
pretend
that
this
plan
will
solve
all
our
problems
it
should
not
be
nor
will
it
be
the
last
plan
of
action
we
propose
guided
us
from
the
start
of
this
crisis
been
the
search
for
silver
bullet
been
commitment
to
stay
at
it
to
be
persistent
to
keep
trying
every
new
idea
that
works
and
listen
to
every
good
proposal
no
matter
which
party
comes
up
with
it
regardless
of
the
arguments
had
in
the
past
regardless
of
the
arguments
we
will
have
in
the
future
this
plan
is
the
right
thing
to
do
right
now
you
should
pass
it
and
intend
to
take
that
message
to
every
corner
of
this
country
and
ask
ask
every
american
who
agrees
to
lift
your
voice
tell
the
people
who
are
gathered
here
tonight
that
you
want
action
now
tell
washington
that
doing
nothing
is
not
an
option
remind
us
that
if
we
act
as
one
nation
and
one
people
we
have
it
within
our
power
to
meet
this
challenge
president
kennedy
once
said
problems
are
therefore
they
can
be
solved
by
man
and
man
can
be
as
big
as
he
these
are
difficult
years
for
our
country
but
we
are
americans
we
are
tougher
than
the
times
we
live
in
and
we
are
bigger
than
our
politics
have
been
so
meet
the
moment

again

more
to

what
else

we
americans
have
been

tough
times
before
much
tougher
than
these
and
we
just
get
through
them
we
emerged
stronger
than
before
not
by
luck
not
by
chance
but
because
in
hard
times
americans
quit
we
give
up
we
summon
that
spirit
that
says
when
we
come
together
when
we
choose
to
move
forward
together
as
one
people
nothing
we
achieve
and
legionnaires
you
know
this
story
because
it
the
story
of
your
lives
and
in
times
like
these
all
americans
can
draw
strength
from
your
example
when
hitler
controlled
continent
and
fascism
appeared
unstoppable
when
our
was
bombed
and
our
pacific
fleet
crippled
there
were
those
that
declared
that
the
united
states
had
been
reduced
to
power
but
you
our
veterans
of
world
war
crossed
the
oceans
and
stormed
the
beaches
and
freed
the
millions
liberated
the
camps
and
showed
the
united
states
of
america
is
the
greatest
force
for
freedom
that
the
world
has
ever
known
when
north
korea
invaded
the
south
pushing
the
allied
forces
into
tiny
sliver
of
territory
the
perimeter
it
seemed
like
the
war
could
be
lost
but
you
our
korean
war
veterans
pushed
back
fought
on
year
after
bloody
year
and
this
past
veterans
day
went
to
seoul
and
joined
our
korean
war
veterans
for
the
anniversary
of
that
war
and
we
marked
that
milestone
in
free
and
prosperous
republic
of
korea
one
of
our
greatest
allies
when
communist
forces
in
unleashed
the
offensive
it
the
debate
here
at
home
that
raged
over
that
war
you
our
veterans
did
not
always
receive
the
respect
that
you
deserved
which
was
national
shame
but
let
it
be
remembered
that
you
won
every
major
battle
of
that
war
every
single
one
as
president
been
to
welcome
our
veterans
to
the
white
house
and
finally
present
them
with
the
medals
and
recognition
that
they
had
earned
been
chance
to
convey
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
those
simple
words
with
which
our
veterans
greet
each
other
legionnaires
in
the
decades
that
followed
the
spirit
of
your
service
was
carried
forth
by
our
troops
in
the
sands
of
desert
storm
and
the
rugged
hills
of
the
and
now
it
carried
on
by
new
generation
next
weekend
we
mark
the
anniversary
of
those
awful
attacks
on
our
nation
in
the
days
ahead

will
the
lives
we
lost
and
the
families
that
loved
them
the
first
responders
who
rushed
to
save
others
and
we
will
all
those
who
have
served
to

difficult
years

armed
forces

uniform
over
the
past
years
they
were
there
on
duty

september
morning
having
enlisted
in
time
of
peace

they
instantly
to
war
footing
the
millions
of
recruits

have
stepped

since
seeing
their
nation
at
war
and
saying
every
single
soldier
sailor
airman
marine
and
coast
guardsman
serving
today
who
has
volunteered

that
they
could
be
sent
into
way

come
from
every
corner
of
our
country

cities
small
towns
they
come
from
every
background
and
every
creed
sons
and
daughters
who
carry
on
the
tradition
of
service
and
they
new
immigrants
become
our
newest
citizens
our
national
guardsmen
and
reservists
who
served
in
unprecedented
deployments
the
record
number
of
women
in
our
military
proving
themselves
in
combat
like
never
before
and
every
day
for
the
past
years
these
men
and
women
have
succeeded
together
as
one
american
team
they
generation
of
innovators
and
changed
the
way
america
fights
and
wins
at
wars
raised
in
the
age
of
the
internet
harnessed
new
technologies
on
the
battlefield
learned
the
cultures
and
traditions
and
languages
of
the
places
where
they
served
trained
to
fight
also
taken
on
the
role
of
diplomats
and
mayors
and
development
experts
negotiating
with
tribal
sheikhs
working
with
village
partnering
with
communities
young
captains
sergeants
lieutenants
they
assumed
responsibilities
once
reserved
for
more
senior
commanders
and
reminding
us
that
in
an
era
when
so
many
other
institutions
have
shirked
their
obligations
the
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
military
welcome
responsibility
in
decade
of
war
they
borne
an
extraordinary
burden
with
more
than
million
of
our
service
members
deploying
to
the
hundreds
of
thousands
have
deployed
again
and
again
year
after
year
never
before
has
our
nation
asked
so
much
of
our
force
that
one
percent
of
americans
who
wears
the
uniform
we
see
the
scope
of
their
sacrifice
in
the
tens
of
thousands
who
now
carry
the
scars
of
war
both
seen
and
unseen
our
remarkable
wounded
warriors
we
see
it
in
our
extraordinary
military
families
who
serve
here
at
home
the
military
spouses
who
hold
their
families
together
the
millions
of
military
children
many
of
whom
have
lived
most
of
their
young
lives
with
our
nation
at
war
and
mom
or
dad
deployed
most
profoundly
we
see
the
wages
of
war
in
those
patriots
who
never
came
home
they
gave
their
all
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
in
in
the
in
in
the
battles
for
baghdad
and
and
now
they
lay
at
rest
in
quiet
corners
of
america
but
they
live
on
in
the
families
who
loved
them
and
in
nation
that
is
safer
because
of
their
service
and
today
we
pay
humble
tribute
to
the
more
than
americans
in
uniform
who
have
given
their
lives
in
this
hard
decade
of
war
we
them
all
we
are
grateful
for
them
through
their
service
through
their
sacrifice
through
their
astonishing
record
of
achievement
our
forces
have
earned
their
place
among
the
greatest
of
generations
toppling
the
in
just
weeks
driving
from
the
training
camps
where
they
plotted
giving
the
afghan
people
the
opportunity
to
live
free
from
terror
when
the
decision
was
made
to
go
into
iraq
our
troops
raced
across
deserts
and
removed
dictator
in
less
than
month
when
insurgents
militias
and
terrorists
plunged
iraq
into
chaos
our
troops
adapted
they
endured
ferocious
urban
combat
they
reduced
the
violence
and
gave
iraqis
chance
to
forge
their
own
future
when
resurgent
threatened
to
give
more
space
to
plot
against
us
the
additional
forces
ordered
to
went
on
the
offensive
taking
the
fight
to
the
and
pushing
them
out
of
their
safe
havens
allowing
afghans
to
reclaim
their
communities
and
training
afghan
forces
and
few
months
ago
our
troops
achieved
our
greatest
victory
yet
in
the
fight
against
those
who
attacked
us
on
delivering
justice
to
bin
laden
in
one
of
the
greatest
intelligence
and
military
operations
in
american
history
credit
for
these
successes
credit
for
this
progress
belongs
to
all
who
have
worn
the
uniform
in
these
wars
today
we
to
be
joined
by
some
of
them
and
would
ask
all
those
who
served
this
past
decade
the
members
of
the
generation
to
stand
and
accept
the
thanks
of
grateful
nation
thanks
to
these
americans
moving
forward
from
position
of
strength
having
ended
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
and
removed
more
than
troops
so
far
remove
the
rest
of
our
troops
by
the
end
of
this
year
and
we
will
end
that
war
having
put
on
the
path
to
defeat
we
relent
until
the
job
is
done
having
started
to
draw
down
our
forces
in
bring
home
troops
by
next
summer
and
bring
home
more
troops
in
the
coming
years
as
our
mission
transitions
from
combat
to
support
afghans
will
take
responsibility
for
their
own
security
and
the
longest
war
in
american
history
will
come
to
responsible
end
for
our
troops
and
military
families
who
sacrificed
so
much
this
means
relief
from
an
unrelenting
decade
of
operations
today
fewer
of
our
sons
and
daughters
are
serving
in
way
for
so
many
troops
already
done
their
duty
put
an
end
to
the
stop
loss
and
our
soldiers
can
now
look
forward
to
shorter
deployments
that
means
more
time
at
home
between
deployments
and
more
time
training
for
the
full
range
of
missions
that
they
will
face
indeed
despite
years
of
continuous
war
it
must
be
said
military
is
the
best
that
ever
been
we
saw
that
most
recently
in
the
skill
and
precision
of
our
brave
forces
who
helped
the
libyan
people
finally
break
free
from
the
grip
of
and
as
we
meet
the
test
that
the
future
will
surely
bring
including
hard
fiscal
choices
here
at
home
there
should
be
no
doubt
the
united
states
of
america
will
keep
our
military
the
the
the
fighting
force
in
history
it
will
continue
to
be
the
best
now
as
wars
end
as
our
troops
come
home
reminded
once
more
of
our
responsibilities
to
all
who
have
served
the
bond
between
our
forces
and
our
citizens
must
be
sacred
trust
and
for
me
and
my
administration
upholding
that
trust
is
not
just
matter
of
policy
it
is
not
about
politics
it
is
moral
obligation
why
my
very
first
budget
included
the
largest
percentage
increase
to
the
budget
in
the
past
years
so
far
on
track
to
have
increased
funding
for
veterans
affairs
by
percent
and
because
we
passed
advanced
appropriations
when
washington
politics
threatens
to
shut
down
the
government
as
it
did
last
spring
the
veterans
medical
care
that
you
count
on
was
safe
and
let
me
say
something
else
about
funding
that
you
depend
on
as
nation
facing
some
tough
choices
as
we
put
our
fiscal
house
in
order
but
want
to
be
absolutely
clear
we
can
not
we
must
not
we
will
not
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
our
veterans
as
allow
it
with
these
historic
investments
making
dramatic
improvements
to
veterans
health
care
improving
facilities
to
better
serve
our
women
veterans
expanding
outreach
and
care
for
our
rural
veterans
like
those
that
met
during
my
recent
visit
to
cannon
falls
including
two
proud
legionnaires
of
legion
post
in
and
joseph
post
in
are
they
here
right
now
they
out
there
somewhere
that
was
good
lunch
by
the
way
for
our
veterans
because
we
declared
that
three
diseases
are
now
presumed
to
be
related
to
your
exposure
to
agent
orange
begun
paying
the
disability
benefits
that
you
need
for
our
veterans
of
the
gulf
war
moving
forward
to
address
the
nine
infectious
diseases
that
we
declared
are
now
presumed
to
be
related
to
your
service
in
desert
storm
at
the
same
time
our
outstanding
secretary
is
working
every
day
to
build
century
many
of
our
vets
are
already
submitting
their
agent
orange
claims
electronically
hundreds
of
you
from
all
wars
are
requesting
your
benefits
thanks
to
the
new
on
the
website
you
can
now
share
your
personal
health
information
with
your
doctors
outside
of
the
and
making
progress
in
sharing
medical
records
between
and
not
there
yet
been
pounding
on
this
thing
since
came
into
office
we
are
going
to
stay
on
it
we
going
to
keep
at
it
until
our
troops
and
our
veterans
have
lifetime
electronic
medical
record
that
you
can
keep
for
your
life
of
course
still
got
some
work
to
do
we
got
to
break
the
backlog
of
disability
claims
know
that
over
the
past
year
the
backlog
has
actually
grown
due
to
new
claims
from
agent
orange
but
let
me
say
this
and
know
secretary
agrees
when
our
veterans
who
fought
for
our
country
have
to
fight
just
to
get
the
benefits
that
already
earned
unacceptable
so
this
is
going
to
remain
key
priority
for
us
going
to
keep
hiring
new
claims
processors
and
going
to
keep
investing
in
new
paperless
systems
and
keep
moving
ahead
with
our
innovation
competition
in
which
our
dedicated
employees
are
developing
new
ways
to
process
your
claims
faster
we
want
your
claims
to
be
processed
not
in
months
but
in
days
so
the
bottom
line
is
this
your
claims
need
to
be
processed
quickly
and
accurately
the
first
time
not
going
to
rest
until
we
get
that
done
we
will
not
rest
the
same
is
true
for
our
mission
to
end
homelessness
among
our
veterans
already
helped
to
bring
tens
of
thousands
of
veterans
off
the
streets
for
the
first
time
ever
made
veterans
and
military
families
priority
not
just
at
the
not
just
at
but
across
the
federal
government
and
that
includes
making
sure
that
federal
agencies
are
working
together
so
that
every
veteran
who
fought
for
america
has
home
in
america
working
to
our
obligations
to
our
generation
veterans
especially
our
wounded
warriors
the
constant
threat
of
has
meant
new
generation
of
service
members
with
multiple
traumatic
injuries
including
traumatic
brain
injury
and
thanks
to
advanced
and
medical
technologies
our
troops
are
surviving
injuries
that
would
have
been
fatal
in
previous
wars
so
saving
more
lives
but
more
american
veterans
live
with
severe
wounds
for
lifetime
that
why
we
need
to
be
for
them
for
their
lifetime
giving
unprecedented
support
to
our
wounded
warriors
especially
those
with
traumatic
brain
injury
and
thanks
to
the
veterans
and
legislation
signed
into
law
started
training
so
that
they
can
receive
the
skills
and
the
stipends
that
they
need
to
care
for
their
loved
ones
working
aggressively
to
address
another
signature
wound
of
this
war
which
has
led
to
too
many
fine
troops
and
veterans
to
take
their
own
lives
and
stress
disorder
continuing
to
make
major
investments
improving
outreach
and
suicide
prevention
hiring
and
training
more
mental
health
and
treating
more
veterans
than
ever
before
the
days
when
depression
and
were
those
days
must
end
why
made
the
decision
to
start
sending
condolence
letters
to
the
families
of
service
members
who
take
their
lives
while
deployed
in
combat
zone
these
americans
did
not
die
because
they
were
weak
they
were
warriors
they
deserve
our
respect
every
man
and
woman
in
uniform
every
veteran
needs
to
know
that
your
nation
will
be
there
to
help
you
stay
strong
the
right
thing
to
do
in
recent
months
heard
new
reports
of
some
of
our
veterans
not
getting
the
prompt
mental
health
care
that
they
desperately
need
and
that
too
is
unacceptable
if
veteran
has
the
courage
to
seek
help
then
we
need
to
be
doing
everything
in
our
power
to
deliver
the
lifesaving
mental
care
that
they
need
so
secretary
and
the
are
going
to
stay
on
this
and
we
continue
to
make
it
easier
for
veterans
with
stress
to
qualify
for
benefits
regardless
of
the
war
that
you
served
in
if
you
served
in
combat
and
doctor
confirms
diagnosis
of
that
enough
which
brings
me
to
the
final
area
where
america
must
meet
its
obligations
to
our
veterans
and
this
is
place
where
we
need
each
other
and
the
task
of
renewing
our
economic
strength
after
decade
of
war
time
to
focus
on
nation
building
here
at
home
and
our
veterans
especially
our
veterans
have
the
skills
and
the
dedication
to
help
lead
the
way
why
funding
the
bill
which
is
now
helping
more
than
veterans
and
family
members
go
to
college
get
their
degrees
and
play
their
part
in
moving
america
forward
why
this
fall
start
including
vocational
training
and
apprenticeships
as
well
so
veterans
can
develop
the
skills
to
succeed
in
economy
and
why
directed
the
federal
government
to
hire
more
veterans
including
more
than
veterans
in
the
past
year
and
half
alone
but
in
this
tough
economy
far
too
many
of
our
veterans
are
still
unemployed
why
proposed
comprehensive
initiative
to
make
sure
tapping
the
incredible
talents
of
our
veterans
and
got
two
main
parts
first
going
to
do
more
to
help
our
newest
veterans
find
and
get
that
private
sector
job
going
to
offer
going
to
offer
more
help
with
career
development
and
job
searches
directed
and
the
to
create
what
calling
boot
to
help
our
newest
veterans
prepare
for
civilian
jobs
and
translate
their
exceptional
military
skills
into
industry
into
licenses
and
credentials
and
today
calling
on
every
state
to
pass
legislation
that
makes
it
easier
for
our
veterans
to
get
the
credentials
and
the
jobs
for
which
they
are
so
clearly
qualified
this
needs
to
happen
and
it
needs
to
happen
now
second
encouraging
the
private
sector
to
do
its
part
so
challenged
companies
across
america
to
hire
or
train
unemployed
veterans
or
their
spouses
and
this
builds
on
the
commitments
that
many
companies
have
already
made
as
part
of
the
joining
forces
campaign
championed
by
the
first
lady
and
the
vice
spouse
jobs
for
veterans
and
spouses
and
to
get
this
done
proposed
returning
tax
credit
for
companies
that
hire
unemployed
veterans
and
wounded
warrior
tax
credit
for
companies
that
hire
unemployed
veterans
with
disability
when
congress
returns
from
recess
this
needs
to
be
at
the
top
of
their
agenda
for
the
sake
of
our
veterans
for
the
sake
of
our
economy
we
need
these
veterans
working
and
contributing
and
creating
the
new
jobs
and
industries
that
will
keep
america
competitive
in
the
century
these
are
the
obligations
we
have
to
each
other
our
forces
our
veterans
our
citizens
these
are
the
responsibilities
we
must
not
just
when
easy
not
just
when
flush
with
cash
not
just
when
convenient
but
always
lesson
we
learned
again
this
year
in
the
life
and
in
the
passing
of
frank
buckles
our
last
veteran
from
the
first
world
war
he
passed
away
at
the
age
of
think
about
it
frank
lived
the
american
century
an
ambulance
driver
on
the
western
front
he
bore
witness
to
the
carnage
of
the
trenches
in
europe
then
during
the
second
world
war
he
survived
more
than
three
years
in
prisoner
of
war
camps
then
like
so
many
veterans
he
came
home
went
to
school
pursued
career
started
family
lived
good
life
on
his
farm
in
west
virginia
even
in
his
later
years
after
turning
frank
buckles
still
gave
back
to
his
country
go
speak
to
schoolchildren
about
his
extraordinary
life
meet
and
inspire
other
veterans
and
for
years
he
served
as
proud
member
of
the
american
legion
the
day
he
was
laid
to
rest
ordered
the
flags
be
flown
at
at
the
white
house
at
the
government
buildings
across
the
nation
at
our
embassies
around
the
world
as
frank
buckles
lay
in
at
memorial
chapel
hundreds
passed
by
his
casket
in
quiet
procession
most
were
strangers
who
never
knew
him
but
they
knew
the
story
of
his
service
and
they
felt
compelled
to
offer
their
thanks
to
this
american
soldier
and
that
afternoon
had
the
privilege
of
going
over
to
and
spending
few
moments
with
daughter
who
cared
for
her
father
to
the
very
end
and
it
was
chance
for
me
to
convey
the
gratitude
of
an
entire
nation
and
to
pay
my
respects
to
an
american
who
reflected
the
best
of
who
we
are
as
people
and
legionnaires
it
was
reminder
not
just
to
the
family
and
friends
of
corporal
frank
buckles
but
to
the
veterans
and
families
of
every
generation
no
matter
when
you
serve
no
matter
how
many
years
ago
that
you
took
off
the
uniform
no
matter
how
long
you
live
as
proud
veteran
of
this
country
we
love
america
will
never
leave
your
side
america
will
never
forget
we
will
always
be
grateful
to
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
all
our
veterans
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
afternoon
everybody
congress
has
now
approved
compromise
to
reduce
the
deficit
and
avert
default
that
would
have
devastated
our
economy
it
was
long
and
contentious
debate
and
want
to
thank
the
american
people
for
keeping
up
the
pressure
on
their
elected
officials
to
put
politics
aside
and
work
together
for
the
good
of
the
country
this
compromise
guarantees
more
than
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
an
important
first
step
to
ensuring
that
as
nation
we
live
within
our
means
yet
it
also
allows
us
to
keep
making
key
investments
in
things
like
education
and
research
that
lead
to
new
jobs
and
assures
that
not
cutting
too
abruptly
while
the
economy
is
still
fragile
this
is
however
just
the
first
step
this
compromise
requires
that
both
parties
work
together
on
larger
plan
to
cut
the
deficit
which
is
important
for
the
health
of
our
economy
and
since
you
close
the
deficit
with
just
spending
cuts
need
balanced
approach
where
everything
is
on
the
table
yes
that
means
making
some
adjustments
to
protect
health
care
programs
like
so
there
for
future
generations
it
also
means
reforming
our
tax
code
so
that
the
wealthiest
americans
and
biggest
corporations
pay
their
fair
share
and
it
means
getting
rid
of
taxpayer
subsidies
to
oil
and
gas
companies
and
tax
loopholes
that
help
billionaires
pay
lower
tax
rate
than
teachers
and
nurses
said
it
before
will
say
it
again
we
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
the
very
people
who
have
borne
the
biggest
brunt
of
this
recession
we
make
it
tougher
for
young
people
to
go
to
college
or
ask
seniors
to
pay
more
for
health
care
or
ask
scientists
to
give
up
on
promising
medical
research
because
we
close
tax
shelter
for
the
most
fortunate
among
us
everyone
is
going
to
have
to
chip
in
only
fair
the
principle
be
fighting
for
during
the
next
phase
of
this
process
and
in
the
coming
months
continue
also
to
fight
for
what
the
american
people
care
most
about
new
jobs
higher
wages
and
faster
economic
growth
while
washington
has
been
absorbed
in
this
debate
about
deficits
people
across
the
country
are
asking
what
we
can
do
to
help
the
father
looking
for
work
what
are
we
going
to
do
for
the
single
mom
seen
her
hours
cut
back
at
the
hospital
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
make
it
easier
for
businesses
to
put
up
that
sign
part
of
the
reason
that
people
are
so
frustrated
with
been
going
on
in
this
town
in
the
last
few
months
the
economy
has
already
had
to
absorb
an
earthquake
in
japan
the
economic
headwinds
coming
from
europe
the
arab
spring
and
the
rise
in
oil
prices
all
of
which
have
been
very
challenging
for
the
recovery
but
these
are
things
we
control
our
economy
need
washington
to
come
along
with
manufactured
crisis
to
make
things
worse
that
was
in
our
hands
pretty
likely
that
the
uncertainty
surrounding
the
raising
of
the
debt
ceiling
for
both
businesses
and
consumers
has
been
unsettling
and
just
one
more
impediment
to
the
full
recovery
that
we
need
and
it
was
something
that
we
could
have
avoided
entirely
so
voters
may
have
chosen
divided
government
but
they
sure
vote
for
dysfunctional
government
they
want
us
to
solve
problems
they
want
us
to
get
this
economy
growing
and
adding
jobs
and
while
deficit
reduction
is
part
of
that
agenda
it
is
not
the
whole
agenda
growing
the
economy
just
about
cutting
spending
not
about
rolling
back
regulations
that
protect
our
air
and
our
water
and
keep
our
people
safe
not
how
going
to
get
past
this
recession
going
to
have
to
do
more
than
that
and
why
when
congress
gets
back
from
recess
will
urge
them
to
immediately
take
some
steps
bipartisan
steps
that
will
make
difference
that
will
create
climate
where
businesses
can
hire
where
folks
have
more
money
in
their
pockets
to
spend
where
people
who
are
out
of
work
can
find
good
jobs
we
need
to
begin
by
extending
tax
cuts
for
families
so
that
you
have
more
money
in
your
next
year
if
got
more
money
in
your
more
likely
to
spend
it
and
that
means
small
businesses
and
businesses
and
large
businesses
will
all
have
more
customers
that
means
be
in
better
position
to
hire
and
while
at
it
we
need
to
make
sure
that
millions
of
workers
who
are
still
pounding
the
pavement
looking
for
jobs
to
support
their
families
are
not
denied
needed
unemployment
benefits
through
patent
reform
we
can
cut
the
red
tape
that
stops
too
many
inventors
and
entrepreneurs
from
quickly
turning
new
ideas
into
thriving
businesses
which
holds
our
whole
economy
back
and
want
congress
to
pass
set
of
trade
deals
deals
already
negotiated
that
would
help
displaced
workers
looking
for
new
jobs
and
would
allow
our
businesses
to
sell
more
products
in
countries
in
asia
and
south
america
products
that
are
stamped
with
the
words
in
we
also
need
to
give
more
opportunities
to
all
those
construction
workers
out
there
who
lost
their
jobs
when
the
housing
boom
went
bust
we
could
put
them
to
work
right
now
by
giving
loans
to
private
companies
that
want
to
repair
our
roads
and
our
bridges
and
our
airports
rebuilding
our
infrastructure
we
have
workers
who
need
jobs
and
country
that
needs
rebuilding
an
infrastructure
bank
would
help
us
put
them
together
and
while
on
the
topic
of
infrastructure
another
stalemate
in
congress
right
now
involving
our
aviation
industry
which
has
stalled
airport
construction
projects
all
around
the
country
and
put
the
jobs
of
tens
of
thousands
of
construction
workers
and
others
at
risk
because
of
politics
another
wound
on
america
and
congress
needs
to
break
that
impasse
now
hopefully
before
the
senate
adjourns
so
these
folks
can
get
back
to
work
so
these
are
some
things
that
we
could
be
doing
right
now
no
reason
for
congress
not
to
send
me
those
bills
so
can
sign
them
into
law
right
away
as
soon
as
they
get
back
from
recess
both
parties
share
power
in
washington
and
both
parties
need
to
take
responsibility
for
improving
this
economy
not
democratic
responsibility
or
republican
responsibility
it
is
our
collective
responsibility
as
americans
and
be
discussing
additional
ideas
in
the
weeks
ahead
to
help
companies
hire
invest
and
expand
so
seen
in
the
past
few
days
that
washington
has
the
ability
to
focus
when
timer
ticking
down
and
when
looming
disaster
it
take
the
risk
of
default
the
risk
of
economic
catastrophe
to
get
folks
in
this
town
to
work
together
and
do
their
jobs
because
already
quiet
crisis
going
on
in
the
lives
of
lot
of
families
in
lot
of
communities
all
across
the
country
looking
for
work
and
they
have
been
for
while
or
making
do
with
fewer
hours
or
fewer
customers
or
just
trying
to
make
ends
meet
that
ought
to
compel
washington
to
cooperate
that
ought
to
compel
washington
to
compromise
and
it
ought
to
compel
washington
to
act
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
get
all
of
us
in
this
town
to
do
the
jobs
we
were
sent
here
to
do
got
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
grow
this
economy
and
put
america
back
to
work
what
intend
to
do
and
looking
forward
to
working
with
congress
to
make
it
happen
thanks
very
much
everybody
good
evening
there
are
still
some
very
important
votes
to
be
taken
by
members
of
congress
but
want
to
announce
that
the
leaders
of
both
parties
in
both
chambers
have
reached
an
agreement
that
will
reduce
the
deficit
and
avoid
default
default
that
would
have
had
devastating
effect
on
our
economy
the
first
part
of
this
agreement
will
cut
about
trillion
in
spending
over
the
next
years
cuts
that
both
parties
had
agreed
to
early
on
in
this
process
the
result
would
be
the
lowest
level
of
annual
domestic
spending
since
was
president
but
at
level
that
still
allows
us
to
make
investments
in
things
like
education
and
research
we
also
made
sure
that
these
cuts
happen
so
abruptly
that
be
drag
on
fragile
economy
now
said
from
the
beginning
that
the
ultimate
solution
to
our
deficit
problem
must
be
balanced
despite
what
some
republicans
have
argued
believe
that
we
have
to
ask
the
wealthiest
americans
and
biggest
corporations
to
pay
their
fair
share
by
giving
up
tax
breaks
and
special
deductions
despite
what
some
in
my
own
party
have
argued
believe
that
we
need
to
make
some
modest
adjustments
to
programs
like
to
ensure
that
still
around
for
future
generations
that
why
the
second
part
of
this
agreement
is
so
important
it
establishes
bipartisan
committee
of
congress
to
report
back
by
november
with
proposal
to
further
reduce
the
deficit
which
will
then
be
put
before
the
entire
congress
for
an
up
or
down
vote
in
this
stage
everything
will
be
on
the
table
to
hold
us
all
accountable
for
making
these
reforms
tough
cuts
that
both
parties
would
find
objectionable
would
automatically
go
into
effect
if
we
act
and
over
the
next
few
months
continue
to
make
detailed
case
to
these
lawmakers
about
why
believe
balanced
approach
is
necessary
to
finish
the
job
now
is
this
the
deal
would
have
preferred
no
believe
that
we
could
have
made
the
tough
choices
required
on
entitlement
reform
and
tax
reform
right
now
rather
than
through
special
congressional
committee
process
but
this
compromise
does
make
serious
down
payment
on
the
deficit
reduction
we
need
and
gives
each
party
strong
incentive
to
get
balanced
plan
done
before
the
end
of
the
year
most
importantly
it
will
allow
us
to
avoid
default
and
end
the
crisis
that
washington
imposed
on
the
rest
of
america
it
ensures
also
that
we
will
not
face
this
same
kind
of
crisis
again
in
six
months
or
eight
months
or
months
and
it
will
begin
to
lift
the
cloud
of
debt
and
the
cloud
of
uncertainty
that
hangs
over
our
economy
now
this
process
has
been
messy
taken
far
too
long
been
concerned
about
the
impact
that
it
has
had
on
business
confidence
and
consumer
confidence
and
the
economy
as
whole
over
the
last
month
nevertheless
ultimately
the
leaders
of
both
parties
have
found
their
way
toward
compromise
and
want
to
thank
them
for
that
most
of
all
want
to
thank
the
american
people
been
your
voices
your
letters
your
your
tweets
your
phone
calls
that
have
compelled
washington
to
act
in
the
final
days
and
the
american
people
voice
is
very
very
powerful
thing
not
done
yet
want
to
urge
members
of
both
parties
to
do
the
right
thing
and
support
this
deal
with
your
votes
over
the
next
few
days
it
will
allow
us
to
avoid
default
it
will
allow
us
to
pay
our
bills
it
will
allow
us
to
start
reducing
our
deficit
in
responsible
way
and
it
will
allow
us
to
turn
to
the
very
important
business
of
doing
everything
we
can
to
create
jobs
boost
wages
and
grow
this
economy
faster
than
it
currently
growing
what
the
american
people
sent
us
here
to
do
and
what
we
should
be
devoting
all
of
our
time
to
accomplishing
in
the
months
ahead
thank
you
very
much
everybody
good
evening
tonight
want
to
talk
about
the
debate
been
having
in
washington
over
the
national
debt
debate
that
directly
affects
the
lives
of
all
americans
for
the
last
decade
spent
more
money
than
we
take
in
in
the
year
the
government
had
budget
surplus
but
instead
of
using
it
to
pay
off
our
debt
the
money
was
spent
on
trillions
of
dollars
in
new
tax
cuts
while
two
wars
and
an
expensive
prescription
drug
program
were
simply
added
to
our
credit
card
as
result
the
deficit
was
on
track
to
top
trillion
the
year
took
office
to
make
matters
worse
the
recession
meant
that
there
was
less
money
coming
in
and
it
required
us
to
spend
even
more
on
tax
cuts
for
families
to
spur
the
economy
on
unemployment
insurance
on
aid
to
states
so
we
could
prevent
more
teachers
and
firefighters
and
police
officers
from
being
laid
off
these
emergency
steps
also
added
to
the
deficit
now
every
family
knows
that
little
credit
card
debt
is
manageable
but
if
we
stay
on
the
current
path
our
growing
debt
could
cost
us
jobs
and
do
serious
damage
to
the
economy
more
of
our
tax
dollars
will
go
toward
paying
off
the
interest
on
our
loans
businesses
will
be
less
likely
to
open
up
shop
and
hire
workers
in
country
that
balance
its
books
interest
rates
could
climb
for
everyone
who
borrows
money
the
homeowner
with
mortgage
the
student
with
college
loan
the
corner
store
that
wants
to
expand
and
we
have
enough
money
to
make
investments
in
things
like
education
and
infrastructure
or
pay
for
vital
programs
like
and
because
neither
party
is
blameless
for
the
decisions
that
led
to
this
problem
both
parties
have
responsibility
to
solve
it
and
over
the
last
several
months
what
been
trying
to
do
bore
you
with
the
details
of
every
plan
or
proposal
but
basically
the
debate
has
around
two
different
approaches
the
first
approach
says
live
within
our
means
by
making
serious
historic
cuts
in
government
spending
cut
domestic
spending
to
the
lowest
level
been
since
was
president
cut
spending
at
the
pentagon
by
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
cut
out
waste
and
fraud
in
health
care
programs
like
and
at
the
same
time
make
modest
adjustments
so
that
is
still
there
for
future
generations
finally
ask
the
wealthiest
americans
and
biggest
corporations
to
give
up
some
of
their
breaks
in
the
tax
code
and
special
deductions
this
balanced
approach
asks
everyone
to
give
little
without
requiring
anyone
to
sacrifice
too
much
it
would
reduce
the
deficit
by
around
trillion
and
put
us
on
path
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
the
cuts
happen
so
abruptly
that
be
drag
on
our
economy
or
prevent
us
from
helping
small
businesses
and
families
get
back
on
their
feet
right
now
this
approach
is
also
bipartisan
while
many
in
my
own
party
happy
with
the
painful
cuts
it
makes
enough
will
be
willing
to
accept
them
if
the
burden
is
fairly
shared
while
republicans
might
like
to
see
deeper
cuts
and
no
revenue
at
all
there
are
many
in
the
senate
who
have
said
willing
to
put
politics
aside
and
consider
this
approach
because
care
about
solving
the
and
to
his
credit
this
is
the
kind
of
approach
the
republican
speaker
of
the
house
john
was
working
on
with
me
over
the
last
several
weeks
the
only
reason
this
balanced
approach
on
its
way
to
becoming
law
right
now
is
because
significant
number
of
republicans
in
congress
are
insisting
on
different
approach
approach
an
approach
that
ask
the
wealthiest
americans
or
biggest
corporations
to
contribute
anything
at
all
and
because
nothing
is
asked
of
those
at
the
top
of
the
income
scale
such
an
approach
would
close
the
deficit
only
with
more
severe
cuts
to
programs
we
all
care
about
cuts
that
place
greater
burden
on
working
families
so
the
debate
right
now
about
whether
we
need
to
make
tough
choices
democrats
and
republicans
agree
on
the
amount
of
deficit
reduction
we
need
the
debate
is
about
how
it
should
be
done
most
americans
regardless
of
political
party
understand
how
we
can
ask
senior
citizen
to
pay
more
for
her
before
we
ask
corporate
jet
owner
or
the
oil
companies
to
give
up
tax
breaks
that
other
companies
get
how
can
we
ask
student
to
pay
more
for
college
before
we
ask
hedge
fund
managers
to
stop
paying
taxes
at
lower
rate
than
their
secretaries
how
can
we
slash
funding
for
education
and
clean
energy
before
we
ask
people
like
me
to
give
up
tax
breaks
we
need
and
ask
for
not
right
not
fair
we
all
want
government
that
lives
within
its
means
but
there
are
still
things
we
need
to
pay
for
as
country
things
like
new
roads
and
bridges
weather
satellites
and
food
inspection
services
to
veterans
and
medical
research
and
keep
in
mind
that
under
balanced
approach
the
percent
of
americans
who
make
under
would
see
no
tax
increases
at
all
none
in
fact
want
to
extend
the
payroll
tax
cut
for
working
families
what
talking
about
under
balanced
approach
is
asking
americans
whose
incomes
have
gone
up
the
most
over
the
last
decade
millionaires
and
billionaires
to
share
in
the
sacrifice
everyone
else
has
to
make
and
think
these
patriotic
americans
are
willing
to
pitch
in
in
fact
over
the
last
few
decades
pitched
in
every
time
we
passed
bipartisan
deal
to
reduce
the
deficit
the
first
time
deal
was
passed
predecessor
of
mine
made
the
case
for
balanced
approach
by
saying
this
you
rather
reduce
deficits
and
interest
rates
by
raising
revenue
from
those
who
are
not
now
paying
their
fair
share
or
would
you
rather
accept
larger
budget
deficits
higher
interest
rates
and
higher
unemployment
and
think
know
your
those
words
were
spoken
by
but
today
many
republicans
in
the
house
refuse
to
consider
this
kind
of
balanced
approach
an
approach
that
was
pursued
not
only
by
president
but
by
the
first
president
bush
by
president
by
myself
and
by
many
democrats
and
republicans
in
the
united
states
senate
so
left
with
stalemate
now
what
makes
stalemate
so
dangerous
is
that
it
has
been
tied
to
something
known
as
the
debt
ceiling
term
that
most
people
outside
of
washington
have
probably
never
heard
of
before
understand
raising
the
debt
ceiling
does
not
allow
congress
to
spend
more
money
it
simply
gives
our
country
the
ability
to
pay
the
bills
that
congress
has
already
racked
up
in
the
past
raising
the
debt
ceiling
was
routine
since
the
congress
has
always
passed
it
and
every
president
has
signed
it
president
did
it
times
george
bush
did
it
seven
times
and
we
have
to
do
it
by
next
tuesday
august
or
else
we
be
able
to
pay
all
of
our
bills
unfortunately
for
the
past
several
weeks
republican
house
members
have
essentially
said
that
the
only
way
vote
to
prevent
default
is
if
the
rest
of
us
agree
to
their
deep
spending
approach
if
that
happens
and
we
default
we
would
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
all
of
our
bills
bills
that
include
monthly
social
security
checks
benefits
and
the
government
contracts
signed
with
thousands
of
businesses
for
the
first
time
in
history
our
credit
rating
would
be
downgraded
leaving
investors
around
the
world
to
wonder
whether
the
united
states
is
still
good
bet
interest
rates
would
on
credit
cards
on
mortgages
and
on
car
loans
which
amounts
to
huge
tax
hike
on
the
american
people
we
would
risk
sparking
deep
economic
crisis
this
one
caused
almost
entirely
by
washington
so
defaulting
on
our
obligations
is
reckless
and
irresponsible
outcome
to
this
debate
and
republican
leaders
say
that
they
agree
we
must
avoid
default
but
the
new
approach
that
speaker
unveiled
today
which
would
temporarily
extend
the
debt
ceiling
in
exchange
for
spending
cuts
would
force
us
to
once
again
face
the
threat
of
default
just
six
months
from
now
in
other
words
it
solve
the
problem
first
of
all
extension
of
the
debt
ceiling
might
not
be
enough
to
avoid
credit
downgrade
and
the
higher
interest
rates
that
all
americans
would
have
to
pay
as
result
we
know
what
we
have
to
do
to
reduce
our
deficits
no
point
in
putting
the
economy
at
risk
by
kicking
the
can
further
down
the
road
but
an
even
greater
danger
to
this
approach
based
on
what
seen
these
past
few
weeks
we
know
what
to
expect
six
months
from
now
the
house
of
representatives
will
once
again
refuse
to
prevent
default
unless
the
rest
of
us
accept
their
approach
again
they
will
refuse
to
ask
the
wealthiest
americans
to
give
up
their
tax
cuts
or
deductions
again
they
will
demand
harsh
cuts
to
programs
like
and
once
again
the
economy
will
be
held
captive
unless
they
get
their
way
this
is
no
way
to
run
the
greatest
country
on
earth
dangerous
game
that
never
played
before
and
we
afford
to
play
it
now
not
when
the
jobs
and
livelihoods
of
so
many
families
are
at
stake
we
allow
the
american
people
to
become
collateral
damage
to
political
warfare
congress
now
has
one
week
left
to
act
and
there
are
still
paths
forward
the
senate
has
introduced
plan
to
avoid
default
which
makes
down
payment
on
deficit
reduction
and
ensures
that
we
have
to
go
through
this
again
in
six
months
think
much
better
approach
although
serious
deficit
reduction
would
still
require
us
to
tackle
the
tough
challenges
of
entitlement
and
tax
reform
either
way
told
leaders
of
both
parties
that
they
must
come
up
with
fair
compromise
in
the
next
few
days
that
can
pass
both
houses
of
congress
and
compromise
that
can
sign
confident
we
can
reach
this
compromise
despite
our
disagreements
republican
leaders
and
have
found
common
ground
before
and
believe
that
enough
members
of
both
parties
will
ultimately
put
politics
aside
and
help
us
make
progress
now
that
lot
of
the
new
members
of
congress
and
see
on
many
issues
but
we
were
each
elected
by
some
of
the
same
americans
for
some
of
the
same
reasons
yes
many
want
government
to
start
living
within
its
means
and
many
are
fed
up
with
system
in
which
the
deck
seems
stacked
against
americans
in
of
the
wealthiest
few
but
do
you
know
what
people
are
fed
up
with
most
of
all
fed
up
with
town
where
compromise
has
become
dirty
word
they
work
all
day
long
many
of
them
scraping
by
just
to
put
food
on
the
table
and
when
these
americans
come
home
at
night
and
turn
on
the
news
all
they
see
is
the
same
partisan
circus
here
in
washington
they
see
leaders
who
seem
to
come
together
and
do
what
it
takes
to
make
life
just
little
bit
better
for
ordinary
americans
offended
by
that
and
they
should
be
the
american
people
may
have
voted
for
divided
government
but
they
vote
for
dysfunctional
government
so
asking
you
all
to
make
your
voice
heard
if
you
want
balanced
approach
to
reducing
the
deficit
let
your
member
of
congress
know
if
you
believe
we
can
solve
this
problem
through
compromise
send
that
message
america
after
all
has
always
been
grand
experiment
in
compromise
as
democracy
made
up
of
every
race
and
religion
where
every
belief
and
point
of
view
is
welcomed
we
have
put
to
the
test
time
and
again
the
proposition
at
the
heart
of
our
founding
that
out
of
many
we
are
one
engaged
in
fierce
and
passionate
debates
about
the
issues
of
the
day
but
from
slavery
to
war
from
civil
liberties
to
questions
of
economic
justice
we
have
tried
to
live
by
the
words
that
once
wrote
man
can
not
have
his
way
in
all
things
without
this
mutual
disposition
we
are
disjointed
individuals
but
not
history
is
scattered
with
the
stories
of
those
who
held
fast
to
rigid
ideologies
and
refused
to
listen
to
those
who
disagreed
but
those
are
not
the
americans
we
remember
we
remember
the
americans
who
put
country
above
self
and
set
personal
grievances
aside
for
the
greater
good
we
remember
the
americans
who
held
this
country
together
during
its
most
difficult
hours
who
put
aside
pride
and
party
to
form
more
perfect
union
who
we
remember
who
we
need
to
be
right
now
the
entire
world
is
watching
so
seize
this
moment
to
show
why
the
united
states
of
america
is
still
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
not
just
because
we
can
still
keep
our
word
and
meet
our
obligations
but
because
we
can
still
come
together
as
one
nation
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
hello
hello
hello
thank
you
very
much
everybody
please
have
seat
thank
you
hello
it
is
good
to
be
back
thank
you
senator
and
mayor
county
executive
dan
state
auditor
jack
and
all
of
you
for
having
me
back
here
at
it
is
good
to
be
here
and
it
seems
like
every
time
here
learn
something
so
for
those
of
you
who
are
thinking
about
it
terrific
place
and
you
guys
are
doing
just
great
work
just
met
with
folks
from
some
companies
and
saw
some
of
their
inventions
here
in
your
national
robotics
engineering
but
not
the
only
reason
here
you
might
not
know
this
but
one
of
my
responsibilities
as
is
to
keep
an
eye
on
robots
and
pleased
to
report
that
the
robots
you
manufacture
here
seem
peaceful
at
least
for
now
this
is
city
that
knows
something
about
manufacturing
for
generations
of
americans
it
was
the
ticket
to
life
here
and
across
america
industrial
heartland
millions
clocked
in
each
day
at
foundries
and
on
assembly
lines
to
make
things
and
the
stuff
we
made
steel
cars
planes
was
the
stuff
that
made
america
what
it
is
the
jobs
were
good
they
paid
enough
to
own
home
to
raise
kids
send
them
to
college
to
retire
they
were
jobs
that
told
us
something
more
important
than
just
how
much
money
we
made
what
was
in
our
these
jobs
also
told
us
that
we
were
meeting
our
responsibilities
to
our
family
and
to
our
and
building
our
communities
and
building
our
country
but
for
better
and
worse
our
generation
has
been
pounded
by
wave
after
wave
of
profound
economic
change
revolutions
in
technology
have
transformed
the
way
we
live
and
the
way
we
work
businesses
and
industries
can
relocate
anywhere
in
the
world
anywhere
that
there
are
skilled
workers
anywhere
that
there
is
an
internet
connection
and
companies
have
learned
to
become
more
efficient
with
fewer
employees
in
you
know
this
as
well
as
anybody
steel
mills
that
once
needed
thousand
workers
now
do
the
same
work
with
hundred
and
while
these
changes
have
resulted
in
great
wealth
for
some
americans
and
have
drastically
increased
productivity
also
caused
major
disruptions
for
many
others
today
high
school
diploma
no
longer
guarantees
you
job
over
the
past
years
about
third
of
our
manufacturing
jobs
have
vanished
and
meanwhile
the
typical
wages
have
barely
kept
up
with
the
rising
costs
of
everything
else
and
all
this
was
even
before
financial
crisis
and
recession
that
pounded
the
middle
class
even
more
now
made
some
tough
decisions
that
have
turned
our
economy
in
positive
direction
over
the
past
two
years
created
more
than
million
new
jobs
in
the
private
sector
over
the
past
months
alone
including
almost
in
manufacturing
but
we
still
have
to
confront
those
underlying
problems
they
caused
overnight
and
we
solve
them
overnight
but
we
will
solve
them
and
starting
to
solve
them
right
here
in
and
right
here
at
and
by
the
way
why
ran
for
president
not
just
to
get
us
back
to
where
we
were
ran
for
president
to
get
us
to
where
we
need
to
be
have
larger
vision
for
america
one
where
working
families
feel
secure
feel
like
they
are
moving
forward
and
that
they
know
that
their
dreams
are
within
reach
an
america
where
our
businesses
lead
the
world
in
new
technologies
like
clean
energy
where
we
work
together
democrats
and
republicans
to
live
within
our
means
to
cut
our
deficit
and
debt
but
also
to
invest
in
what
our
economy
needs
to
grow
education
research
and
building
the
best
transportation
and
communication
infrastructure
anywhere
in
the
world
what
going
to
take
for
us
to
win
the
future
and
winning
the
future
begins
with
getting
our
economy
moving
right
now
and
why
here
is
great
example
of
what
it
means
to
move
forward
at
its
founding
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
trade
school
for
the
sons
and
daughters
of
steelworkers
would
one
day
become
the
largest
one
of
the
largest
employers
and
global
research
university
and
yet
innovations
led
by
your
professors
and
your
students
have
created
more
than
companies
and
jobs
over
the
past
years
companies
like
robotics
but
more
important
than
the
ideas
that
incubated
are
what
those
ideas
have
become
become
products
made
right
here
in
america
and
in
many
cases
sold
all
over
the
world
and
that
in
our
blood
that
who
we
are
we
are
inventors
and
we
are
makers
and
we
are
doers
if
we
want
robust
growing
economy
we
need
robust
growing
manufacturing
sector
why
we
told
the
auto
industry
two
years
ago
that
if
they
were
willing
to
adapt
stand
by
them
today
profitable
creating
jobs
and
repaying
taxpayers
ahead
of
schedule
that
why
launched
partnership
to
retrain
workers
with
new
skills
why
invested
in
clean
energy
manufacturing
and
new
jobs
building
wind
turbines
and
solar
panels
and
advanced
batteries
we
have
not
run
out
of
stuff
to
make
just
got
to
reinvigorate
our
manufacturing
sector
so
that
it
leads
the
world
the
way
it
always
has
from
paper
and
steel
and
cars
to
new
products
that
we
even
dreamed
up
yet
how
going
to
strengthen
existing
industries
that
how
going
to
spark
new
ones
how
going
to
create
jobs
grow
the
middle
class
and
secure
our
economic
leadership
and
this
is
why
asked
my
council
of
on
science
and
technology
what
we
call
while
back
to
look
at
the
state
of
american
manufacturing
and
the
promise
of
advanced
manufacturing
the
concept
of
advanced
manufacturing
is
not
complicated
it
means
how
do
we
do
things
better
faster
cheaper
to
design
and
manufacture
superior
products
that
allow
us
to
compete
all
over
the
world
and
so
these
very
smart
folks
many
of
whom
are
represented
here
wrote
up
report
which
is
now
up
on
the
white
house
website
but
we
did
want
to
just
issue
report
we
wanted
to
actually
get
something
done
so
launched
an
effort
between
our
brightest
academic
minds
some
of
our
boldest
business
leaders
and
our
most
dedicated
public
servants
from
science
and
technology
agencies
all
with
one
big
goal
and
that
is
renaissance
of
american
manufacturing
calling
it
amp
the
advanced
manufacturing
partnership
made
up
of
some
of
the
most
advanced
engineering
universities
like
georgia
tech
michigan
some
of
our
most
innovative
manufacturers
from
to
to
technologies
asked
the
president
of
who
is
here
and
andrew
the
of
chemical
to
lead
this
partnership
and
to
work
with
my
own
on
science
technology
and
manufacturing
throughout
our
history
our
greatest
breakthroughs
have
often
come
from
partnerships
just
like
this
one
american
innovation
has
always
been
sparked
by
individual
scientists
and
entrepreneurs
often
at
universities
like
or
georgia
tech
or
or
but
lot
of
companies
invest
in
early
ideas
because
it
pay
off
right
away
and
where
government
can
step
in
how
we
ended
up
with
some
of
the
innovations
that
our
growth
and
prosperity
and
created
countless
jobs
the
mobile
phone
the
internet
more
than
drugs
and
vaccines
over
the
last
years
was
all
because
we
were
able
to
in
strategic
ways
bring
people
together
and
make
some
critical
investments
take
one
example
the
national
science
foundation
helped
fund
digital
library
project
in
the
the
idea
was
to
develop
universal
digital
library
that
anybody
could
access
so
two
enterprising
students
got
excited
about
the
research
that
was
being
done
at
this
is
funded
by
so
these
two
students
they
moved
from
campus
to
garage
and
they
launched
this
company
called
and
when
the
private
sector
runs
with
the
ball
it
then
leads
to
jobs
building
and
selling
that
is
successful
all
over
the
world
this
new
partnership
that
created
will
make
sure
breakthroughs
are
american
breakthroughs
teaming
up
to
foster
the
kind
of
collaborative
that
resulted
in
those
same
early
discoveries
and
to
create
the
kind
of
innovation
infrastructure
necessary
to
get
ideas
from
the
drawing
board
to
the
manufacturing
floor
to
the
market
more
rapidly
all
of
which
will
make
our
businesses
more
competitive
and
create
new
manufacturing
jobs
now
to
help
businesses
operate
at
less
cost
the
energy
department
will
develop
new
manufacturing
processes
and
materials
that
use
half
as
much
energy
that
will
free
up
more
money
for
companies
to
hire
new
workers
or
buy
new
equipment
to
help
businesses
discover
develop
and
deploy
new
materials
twice
as
fast
launching
what
we
call
the
materials
genome
initiative
the
invention
of
silicon
circuits
and
batteries
made
computers
and
and
possible
but
it
took
years
to
get
those
technologies
from
the
drawing
board
to
the
marketplace
we
can
do
it
faster
to
help
everyone
from
factory
workers
to
astronauts
carry
out
more
complicated
tasks
and
other
agencies
will
support
research
into
robotics
and
just
met
with
folks
from
local
company
robotics
who
make
robots
that
explore
water
and
sewer
pipes
and
have
to
say
it
is
fascinating
stuff
when
you
watch
the
robot
is
about
this
big
it
can
go
through
any
sewer
system
operated
remotely
by
the
municipal
worker
got
camera
attached
so
it
can
film
everything
that
seeing
it
then
transmits
the
data
it
goes
into
database
and
can
enhance
the
productivity
of
these
workers
by
three
or
fourfold
and
help
the
city
make
even
better
decisions
potentially
this
can
save
cities
millions
in
infrastructure
costs
companies
also
are
training
new
workers
to
operate
the
robots
and
analysts
to
pore
through
the
data
being
collected
to
help
smaller
manufacturers
compete
federal
agencies
are
working
with
private
companies
to
make
powerful
often
unaffordable
and
simulation
software
easier
to
access
and
just
saw
an
example
few
years
ago
gamble
teamed
up
with
the
researchers
at
national
labs
to
adapt
software
developed
for
war
to
figure
out
happening
with
nuclear
particles
and
they
are
using
these
simulators
to
dramatically
boost
the
performance
of
diapers
yes
diapers
folks
chuckle
but
those
been
parents
are
always
on
the
lookout
for
indestructible
diapers
but
remarkable
using
this
simulation
software
that
was
developed
at
gamble
has
saved
million
dollars
half
billion
dollars
as
consequence
of
this
simulator
now
through
the
new
partnership
that
setting
up
gamble
is
offering
its
powerful
fluid
dynamics
simulator
to
smaller
manufacturers
and
doing
it
for
free
now
this
is
not
just
because
gamble
wants
to
do
good
also
got
thousands
of
suppliers
and
they
thinking
to
themselves
if
we
can
apply
this
simulation
technology
to
our
smaller
suppliers
they
going
to
be
able
to
make
their
products
cheaper
and
better
then
that
in
turn
is
going
to
save
us
even
more
money
and
it
has
ripple
effect
throughout
the
economy
starting
this
summer
federal
agencies
will
partner
with
industries
to
boost
manufacturing
in
areas
critical
to
our
national
security
just
saw
an
example
backstage
the
department
scientists
we
call
it
the
folks
who
brought
us
stealth
technology
and
by
the
way
who
brought
us
the
internet
wanted
to
see
if
it
was
possible
to
design
systems
cheaper
and
faster
so
they
found
small
company
in
arizona
called
local
motors
and
they
gave
them
test
you
have
one
month
to
design
new
combat
support
vehicle
and
got
three
months
to
build
it
their
jay
is
here
today
and
as
an
who
lost
couple
of
buddies
in
combat
understood
the
importance
of
increasing
the
speed
and
adaptability
and
flexibility
of
our
manufacturing
process
for
vehicles
that
are
used
in
so
local
motors
solicited
design
ideas
on
their
website
chose
the
best
out
of
that
it
received
built
and
brought
this
new
vehicle
here
ahead
of
schedule
we
just
took
look
at
it
not
only
could
this
change
the
way
the
government
uses
your
tax
dollars
because
think
about
it
instead
of
having
lead
time
to
develop
piece
of
equipment
with
all
kinds
of
changing
specs
and
moving
target
if
we
were
able
to
collapse
the
pace
at
which
that
manufacturing
takes
place
that
could
save
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
but
it
also
could
get
products
out
to
faster
which
could
save
lives
more
quickly
and
could
then
be
used
to
transfer
into
the
private
sector
more
rapidly
which
means
we
could
get
better
products
and
services
that
we
can
sell
and
export
around
the
world
so
good
for
american
companies
good
for
american
jobs
good
for
taxpayers
and
it
may
save
some
lives
in
places
like
for
our
soldiers
so
what
this
is
all
about
as
futuristic
and
face
it
as
cool
as
some
of
this
stuff
is
as
much
as
we
are
planning
for
future
this
partnership
is
about
new
ideas
to
create
new
jobs
spark
new
breakthroughs
reinvigorate
american
manufacturing
today
right
now
not
somewhere
off
in
the
future
right
now
about
making
sure
our
workers
and
businesses
have
the
skills
and
the
tools
they
need
to
compete
better
faster
and
smarter
than
anybody
else
that
what
about
we
are
america
and
we
just
keep
up
with
changing
times
we
set
the
pace
for
changing
times
we
adapt
we
innovate
we
lead
the
way
forward
worth
remembering
there
was
time
when
steel
was
about
as
advanced
as
manufacturing
got
but
when
the
namesake
of
this
university
andrew
an
immigrant
by
the
way
discovered
new
ways
to
steel
cheaply
everything
changed
just
years
after
founding
his
company
not
only
was
it
the
largest
most
profitable
in
the
world
america
had
become
the
number
one
in
the
world
now
imagine
if
america
was
first
to
develop
and
new
treatment
that
kills
cancer
cells
but
leaves
healthy
ones
untouched
or
solar
cells
you
can
brush
onto
house
for
the
same
cost
as
paint
or
flexible
display
soldiers
flexible
displays
that
soldiers
can
wear
on
their
arms
or
car
that
drives
itself
imagine
how
many
workers
and
businesses
and
consumers
would
prosper
from
those
breakthroughs
those
things
science

we
will

we
need
to

and
we
will
make

was
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
evening
nearly
years
ago
america
suffered
the
worst
attack
on
our
shores
since
pearl
this
mass
murder
was
planned
by
bin
laden
and
his
network
in
and
new
threat
to
our
security
one
in
which
the
targets
were
no
longer
soldiers
on
battlefield
but
innocent
men
women
and
children
going
about
their
daily
lives
in
the
days
that
followed
our
nation
was
united
as
we
struck
at
and
routed
the
in
then
our
focus
shifted
second
war
was
launched
in
iraq
and
we
spent
enormous
blood
and
treasure
to
support
new
government
there
by
the
time
took
office
the
war
in
had
entered
its
seventh
year
but
leaders
had
escaped
into
pakistan
and
were
plotting
new
attacks
while
the
had
regrouped
and
gone
on
the
offensive
without
new
strategy
and
decisive
action
our
military
commanders
warned
that
we
could
face
resurgent
and
taking
over
large
parts
of
for
this
reason
in
one
of
the
most
difficult
decisions
that
made
as
president
ordered
an
additional
american
troops
into
when
announced
this
surge
at
west
point
we
set
clear
objectives
to
refocus
on
to
reverse
the
momentum
and
train
afghan
security
forces
to
defend
their
own
country
also
made
it
clear
that
our
commitment
would
not
be
and
that
we
would
begin
to
draw
down
our
forces
this
july
tonight
can
tell
you
that
we
are
fulfilling
that
commitment
thanks
to
our
extraordinary
men
and
women
in
uniform
our
civilian
personnel
and
our
many
coalition
partners
we
are
meeting
our
goals
as
result
starting
next
month
we
will
be
able
to
remove
of
our
troops
from
by
the
end
of
this
year
and
we
will
bring
home
total
of
troops
by
next
summer
fully
recovering
the
surge
announced
at
west
point
after
this
initial
reduction
our
troops
will
continue
coming
home
at
steady
pace
as
afghan
security
forces
move
into
the
lead
our
mission
will
change
from
combat
to
support
by
this
process
of
transition
will
be
complete
and
the
afghan
people
will
be
responsible
for
their
own
security
starting
this
from
position
of
strength
is
under
more
pressure
than
at
any
time
since
together
with
the
we
have
taken
out
more
than
half
of
leadership
and
thanks
to
our
intelligence
professionals
and
special
forces
we
killed
bin
laden
the
only
leader
that
had
ever
known
this
was
victory
for
all
who
have
served
since
one
soldier
summed
it
up
well
message
he
said
we
forget
you
will
be
held
accountable
no
matter
how
long
it
the
information
that
we
recovered
from
bin
compound
shows
under
enormous
strain
bin
laden
expressed
concern
that
had
been
unable
to
effectively
replace
senior
terrorists
that
had
been
killed
and
that
has
failed
in
its
effort
to
portray
america
as
nation
at
war
with
islam
thereby
draining
more
widespread
support
remains
dangerous
and
we
must
be
vigilant
against
attacks
but
we
have
put
on
path
to
defeat
and
we
will
not
relent
until
the
job
is
done
in
inflicted
serious
losses
on
the
and
taken
number
of
its
strongholds
along
with
our
surge
our
allies
also
increased
their
commitments
which
helped
more
of
the
country
afghan
security
forces
have
grown
by
over
troops
and
in
some
provinces
and
municipalities
already
begun
to
transition
responsibility
for
security
to
the
afghan
people
in
the
face
of
violence
and
intimidation
afghans
are
fighting
and
dying
for
their
country
establishing
local
police
forces
opening
markets
and
schools
creating
new
opportunities
for
women
and
girls
and
trying
to
turn
the
page
on
decades
of
war
of
course
huge
challenges
remain
this
is
the
beginning
but
not
the
end
of
our
effort
to
wind
down
this
war
have
to
do
the
hard
work
of
keeping
the
gains
that
made
while
we
draw
down
our
forces
and
transition
responsibility
for
security
to
the
afghan
government
and
next
may
in
chicago
we
will
host
summit
with
our
nato
allies
and
partners
to
shape
the
next
phase
of
this
transition
we
do
know
that
peace
can
not
come
to
land
that
has
known
so
much
war
without
political
settlement
so
as
we
strengthen
the
afghan
government
and
security
forces
america
will
join
initiatives
that
reconcile
the
afghan
people
including
the
our
position
on
these
talks
is
clear
they
must
be
led
by
the
afghan
government
and
those
who
want
to
be
part
of
peaceful
must
break
from
abandon
violence
and
abide
by
the
afghan
constitution
but
in
part
because
of
our
military
effort
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
progress
can
be
made
the
goal
that
we
seek
is
achievable
and
can
be
expressed
simply
no
safe
haven
from
which
or
its
affiliates
can
launch
attacks
against
our
homeland
or
our
allies
we
try
to
make
perfect
place
we
will
not
police
its
streets
or
patrol
its
mountains
indefinitely
that
is
the
responsibility
of
the
afghan
government
which
must
step
up
its
ability
to
protect
its
people
and
move
from
an
economy
shaped
by
war
to
one
that
can
sustain
lasting
peace
what
we
can
do
and
will
do
is
build
partnership
with
the
afghan
people
that
endures
one
that
ensures
that
we
will
be
able
to
continue
targeting
terrorists
and
supporting
sovereign
afghan
government
of
course
our
efforts
must
also
address
terrorist
safe
havens
in
pakistan
no
country
is
more
endangered
by
the
presence
of
violent
extremists
which
is
why
we
will
continue
to
press
pakistan
to
expand
its
participation
in
securing
more
peaceful
future
for
this
region
we
work
with
the
government
to
root
out
the
cancer
of
violent
extremism
and
we
will
insist
that
it
keeps
its
commitments
for
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
so
long
as
am
president
the
united
states
will
never
tolerate
safe
haven
for
those
who
aim
to
kill
us
they
can
not
elude
us
nor
escape
the
justice
they
deserve
my
fellow
americans
this
has
been
difficult
decade
for
our
country
we
learned
anew
the
profound
cost
of
war
cost
that
been
paid
by
the
nearly
americans
who
have
given
their
lives
in
iraq
and
the
over
who
have
done
so
in
men
and
women
who
will
not
live
to
enjoy
the
freedom
that
they
defended
thousands
more
have
been
wounded
some
have
lost
limbs
on
the
battlefield
and
others
still
battle
the
demons
that
have
followed
them
home
yet
tonight
we
take
comfort
in
knowing
that
the
tide
of
war
is
receding
fewer
of
our
sons
and
daughters
are
serving
in
way
ended
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
with
american
troops
already
out
of
that
country
and
even
as
there
will
be
dark
days
ahead
in
the
light
of
secure
peace
can
be
seen
in
the
distance
these
long
wars
will
come
to
responsible
end
as
they
do
we
must
learn
their
lessons
already
this
decade
of
war
has
caused
many
to
question
the
nature
of
engagement
around
the
world
some
would
have
america
retreat
from
our
responsibility
as
an
anchor
of
global
security
and
embrace
an
isolation
that
ignores
the
very
real
threats
that
we
face
others
would
have
america
confronting
every
evil
that
can
be
found
abroad
we
must
chart
more
course
like
generations
before
we
must
embrace
singular
role
in
the
course
of
human
events
but
we
must
be
as
pragmatic
as
we
are
passionate
as
strategic
as
we
are
resolute
when
threatened
we
must
respond
with
force
but
when
that
force
can
be
targeted
we
need
not
deploy
large
armies
overseas
when
innocents
are
being
slaughtered
and
global
security
endangered
we
have
to
choose
between
standing
idly
by
or
acting
on
our
own
instead
we
must
rally
international
action
which
doing
in
libya
where
we
do
not
have
single
soldier
on
the
ground
but
are
supporting
allies
in
protecting
the
libyan
people
and
giving
them
the
chance
to
determine
their
own
destiny
in
all
that
we
do
we
must
remember
that
what
sets
america
apart
is
not
solely
our
power
it
is
the
principles
upon
which
our
union
was
founded
nation
that
brings
our
enemies
to
justice
while
adhering
to
the
rule
of
law
and
respecting
the
rights
of
all
our
citizens
we
protect
our
own
freedom
and
prosperity
by
extending
it
to
others
we
stand
not
for
empire
but
for
that
is
why
we
have
stake
in
the
democratic
aspirations
that
are
now
washing
across
the
arab
world
we
will
support
those
revolutions
with
fidelity
to
our
ideals
with
the
power
of
our
example
and
with
an
unwavering
belief
that
all
human
beings
deserve
to
live
with
freedom
and
dignity
above
all
we
are
nation
whose
strength
abroad
has
been
anchored
in
opportunity
for
our
citizens
here
at
home
over
the
last
decade
we
have
spent
trillion
dollars
on
war
at
time
of
rising
debt
and
hard
economic
times
now
we
must
invest
in
greatest
resource
our
people
we
must
unleash
innovation
that
creates
new
jobs
and
industries
while
living
within
our
means
we
must
rebuild
our
infrastructure
and
find
new
and
clean
sources
of
energy
and
most
of
all
after
decade
of
passionate
debate
we
must
recapture
the
common
purpose
that
we
shared
at
the
beginning
of
this
time
of
war
for
our
nation
draws
strength
from
our
differences
and
when
our
union
is
strong
no
hill
is
too
steep
no
horizon
is
beyond
our
reach
america
it
is
time
to
focus
on
nation
building
here
at
home
in
this
effort
we
draw
inspiration
from
our
fellow
americans
who
have
sacrificed
so
much
on
our
behalf
to
our
troops
our
veterans
and
their
families
speak
for
all
americans
when
say
that
we
will
keep
our
sacred
trust
with
you
and
provide
you
with
the
care
and
benefits
and
opportunity
that
you
deserve
met
some
of
these
patriotic
americans
at
fort
awhile
back
spoke
to
the
airborne
that
has
fought
to
turn
the
tide
in
and
to
the
team
that
took
out
bin
laden
standing
in
front
of
model
of
bin
compound
the
navy
seal
who
led
that
effort
paid
tribute
to
those
who
had
been
lost
brothers
and
sisters
in
arms
whose
names
are
now
written
on
bases
where
our
troops
stand
guard
overseas
and
on
headstones
in
quiet
corners
of
our
country
where
their
memory
will
never
be
forgotten
this
officer
like
so
many
others
met
on
bases
in
baghdad
and
and
at
reed
and
naval
hospital
spoke
with
humility
about
how
his
unit
worked
together
as
one
depending
on
each
other
and
trusting
one
another
as
family
might
do
in
time
of
peril
lesson
worth
remembering
that
we
are
all
part
of
one
american
family
though
we
have
known
disagreement
and
division
we
are
bound
together
by
the
creed
that
is
written
into
our
founding
documents
and
conviction
that
the
united
states
of
america
is
country
that
can
achieve
whatever
it
sets
out
to
accomplish
now
let
us
finish
the
work
at
hand
let
us
responsibly
end
these
wars
and
reclaim
the
american
dream
that
is
at
the
of
our
story
with
confidence
in
our
cause
with
faith
in
our
fellow
citizens
and
with
hope
in
our
hearts
let
us
go
about
the
work
of
extending
the
promise
of
america
for
this
generation
and
the
next
may
god
bless
our
troops
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
all
right
good
morning
in
few
moments
be
joining
members
of
our
armed
forces
their
families
and
veterans
for
the
memorial
day
observance
at
there
and
across
our
nation
pause
to
all
those
given
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
in
of
our
country
theirs
was
the
ultimate
sacrifice
but
it
is
one
that
every
man
and
woman
who
wears
uniform
is
prepared
to
make
so
that
we
can
live
free
the
men
and
women
of
our
armed
forces
are
the
best
our
nation
has
to
offer
and
they
deserve
nothing
but
the
absolute
best
in
return
and
that
includes
leaders
who
will
guide
them
and
support
their
families
with
wisdom
and
strength
and
compassion
and
what
expect
as
as
we
work
to
keep
our
nation
secure
and
our
military
the
finest
in
the
world
found
those
qualities
in
who
announced
last
month
as
my
choice
to
succeed
our
outstanding
secretary
of
bob
gates
who
thank
for
joining
us
today
and
found
these
qualities
in
the
leaders
who
will
complete
our
team
at
the
pentagon
and
whom
proud
to
announce
today
general
martin
as
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
admiral
james
as
the
vice
chairman
and
to
succeed
general
as
chief
of
staff
of
the
army
general
ray
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
is
the
principal
military
to
me
and
my
national
security
team
including
the
secretary
of
since
taking
office
been
very
grateful
for
the
leadership
of
the
current
chairman
admiral
mike
and
the
vice
chairman
general
these
two
men
have
served
our
nation
with
distinction
for
decades
and
look
forward
to
paying
tribute
to
their
lives
of
service
in
the
months
ahead
today
simply
say
that
like
president
bush
before
me
deeply
valued
professional
steadiness
and
his
personal
integrity
on
his
watch
our
military
forces
have
excelled
across
the
whole
spectrum
of
missions
from
combat
in
iraq
and
to
relief
efforts
after
the
haiti
earthquake
helped
nato
reset
our
relations
with
russia
and
steer
our
relationship
with
pakistan
and
china
and
believe
that
history
will
also
record
mike
as
the
chairman
who
said
what
he
believed
was
right
and
declared
that
no
one
in
uniform
should
ever
have
to
sacrifice
their
integrity
to
serve
their
country
also
benefited
enormously
from
the
advice
and
counsel
of
is
that
rare
combination
of
technical
expert
from
to
missile
and
strategic
thinker

it
was
updating
our
nuclear
posture
or
preparing
our
military
for
missions
always
be
personally
grateful
to
for
his
friendship
and
partnership
and
as
he
concludes
four
decades
of
service
in
the
marine
corps
that
he
loves
he
can
do
so
knowing
that
our
nation
is
more
secure
and
our
military
is
stronger
because
of
his
remarkable
career
and
know
that
joins
me
in
saluting
and
for
their
decades
of
extraordinary
service
especially
as
champions
of
our
inspiring
military
families
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate

is
our
hope
and
expectation
that

soon
take
the
reigns
as
secretary
of
general
term
ends
this
summer
admiral
term
ends
this
fall
announcing
my
choice

on
the
urgent
national
security
challenges

deputy

the
continuity
that

during
this
transition
with
nearly
years
in
uniform
martin
is
one
of
our
most
respected
and
generals
in
iraq
he
led
our
soldiers
against
brutal
insurgency
having
trained
iraqi
forces
he
knows
that
nations
must
ultimately
take
responsibility
for
their
own
security
having
served
as
acting
commander
of
central
command
he
understands
that
in
iraq
and
security
gains
and
political
progress
must
go
hand
in
hand
and
just
as
he
challenged
the
army
to
embrace
new
doctrine
and
tactics
expect
him
to
push
all
our
forces
to
continue
adapting
and
innovating
to
be
ready
for
the
missions
of
today
and
tomorrow

proud
to
nominate

he
only
assumed
that
position
last
month
your
tenure
as
chief
may
go
down
as
one
of
the
shortest
in
army
history
but
your
lifetime
of
accomplishment
that
brings
us
here
today
and
thank

mary
and
your
two
sons
for
your
continued
service
selected
general
and
admiral
because
of
their
record
and
potential
as
individuals
but
also
selected
them
because
they
will
make
an
extraordinary
team
despite
their
competing
loyalties
to
army
and
navy
between
them
they
bring
deep
experience
in
virtually
every
domain
land
air
space
sea
both
of
them
have
the
respect
and
the
trust
of
our
troops
on
the
our
friends
in
congress
and
allies
and
partners
abroad

both
of
them
have
my
full
confidence
they
both
have
something
else
for
the
first
time
the
chairman
and
vice
chairman
will
have
the
experience
of
leading
combat
operations
in
the
years
since
two
moments
in
particular
speak
to
this
leadership
on
the
morning
of
september
the
enterprise
was
returning
home
from
the
persian
gulf
when
word
came
of
the
attacks
rather
than
wait
for
orders
sandy
took
the
initiative
reversed
course
and
put
his
ship
and
aircraft
within
range
of
by
the
next
morning
setting
the
stage
for
the
strikes
that
followed
few
years
later
as
division
was
rotating
out
of
iraq
he
suddenly
got
new
orders
he
turned
his
division
around
shifted
to
new
parts
of
iraq
and
defeated
an
insurgent
uprising
remarkable
maneuver
that
has
entered
the
annals
of
army
history
and
while
know
that
folks
across
the
army
are
proud
to
see
one
of
their
own
selected
as
chairman
also
know
this
means
losing
their
new
chief
in
time
of
war
and
why
for
the
next
army
chief
of
staff
nominating
one
of
the
most
accomplished
soldiers
and
one
of
the
tallest
general
ray
in
three
pivotal
deployments
to
iraq
he
commanded
the
troops
that
captured
partnered
with
general
to
help
bring
down
the
violence
and
then
transferred
responsibility
to
iraqi
forces
allowing
us
to
remove
some
american
troops
and
end
our
combat
mission
after
years
on
the
ray
understands
what
the
army
must
do
to
prevail
in
wars
to
prepare
for
the
future
and
to
preserve
the
readiness
of
the
soldiers
and
families
who
are
the
strength
of
families
and
fortunate
that
dedication
to
our
soldiers
is
shared
by
his
wife
and
their
family
including
their
son
tony
combat
veteran
and
advocate
for
his
fellow
wounded
warriors
urge
our
friends
in
the
senate
to
confirm
these
outstanding
individuals
as
swiftly
as
possible
innovative
flexible
focused
on
the
future
and
deeply
devoted
to
our
troops
and
their
families
general
admiral
we
have
much
to
do
from
bringing
our
troops
home
from
iraq
to
beginning
to
reduce
our
forces
in
this
summer
and
to
afghan
lead
from
defeating
to
protecting
the
libyan
people
all
this
even
as
we
make
difficult
budget
decisions
while
keeping
our
military
the
finest
fighting
force
in
the
world
above
all
as
be
looking
to
you
and
the
rest
of
the
joint
chiefs
for
what
value
most
in
my
your
honest
unvarnished
advice
and
the
full
range
of
options
especially
when
it
comes
to
our
most
solemn
obligation
protecting
the
lives
of
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
we
have
no
greater
responsibility
as
we
are
reminded
today
when
we
all
those
who
sacrificed
so
that
we
can
enjoy
the
blessings
of
freedom
so
again
to
sandy
and
ray
as
well
as
your
families
thank
you
for
your
patriotic
service
and
your
readiness
to
lead
once
more
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
governor
for
that
powerful
message
but
more
importantly
for
being
here
with
and
for
your
people
every
step
of
the
way
we
are
grateful
to
you
to
reverend
father
so
glad
you
got
in
that
tub
to
reverend
brown
for
that
incredibly
powerful
message
to
senator
been
here
and
congressman
billy
long
mayor
to
it
get
lot
of
attention
but
he
heads
up
our
emergency
response
at
the
federal
level
been
going
from
to
and
everywhere
in
between
tirelessly
doing
outstanding
work
grateful
for
him
the
president
of
the
national
red
cross
which
has
contributed
mightily
to
the
rebuilding
efforts
here
most
of
all
to
the
family
and
friends
of
all
those
been
lost
and
all
those
been
affected
today
we
gather
to
celebrate
the
lives
of
those
lost
to
the
storms
here
in
and
across
the
to
keep
in
our
prayers
those
still
missing
to
mourn
with
their
families
to
stand
together
during
this
time
of
pain
and
trial
and
as
reverend
brown
alluded
to
the
question
that
weighs
on
us
at
time
like
this
is
why
why
our
town
why
our
home
why
my
son
or
husband
or
wife
or
sister
or
friend
why
we
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
answer
we
know
when
terrible
storm
will
strike
or
where
or
the
severity
of
the
devastation
that
it
may
cause
we
know
why
tested
with
the
loss
of
loved
one
or
the
loss
of
home
where
lived
lifetime
these
things
are
beyond
our
power
to
control
but
that
does
not
mean
we
are
powerless
in
the
face
of
adversity
how
we
respond
when
the
storm
strikes
is
up
to
us
how
we
live
in
the
aftermath
of
tragedy
and
heartache
within
our
control
and
in
these
moments
through
our
actions
that
we
often
see
the
glimpse
of
what
makes
life
worth
living
in
the
first
place
in
the
last
week
what
has
not
just
taught
missouri
not
just
taught
america
but
has
taught
the
world
was
overseas
in
the
aftermath
of
the
storm
and
had
world
leaders
coming
up
to
me
saying
let
the
people
of
know
we
are
with
them
thinking
about
them
we
love
them
because
the
world
saw
how
responded
university
turned
itself
into
makeshift
hospital
some
of
you
used
your
pickup
trucks
as
ambulances
carrying
the
injured
on
doors
that
served
as
stretchers
your
restaurants
have
rushed
food
to
people
in
need
businesses
have
filled
trucks
with
donations
waited
in
line
for
hours
to
donate
blood
to
people
you
know
but
also
to
people
never
met
and
in
all
this
you
have
lived
the
words
of
scripture
we
are
troubled
on
every
side
yet
not
distressed
we
are
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
persecuted
but
not
forsaken
cast
down
but
not
destroyed
as
the
governor
said
you
have
shown
the
world
what
it
means
to
love
thy
banded
together
come
to
each
aid
demonstrated
simple
truth
that
amid
heartbreak
and
tragedy
no
one
is
stranger
everybody
is
brother
everybody
is
sister
we
can
all
love
one
another
as
you
move
forward
in
the
days
ahead
know
that
rebuilding
what
lost
be
easy
just
walked
through
some
of
the
that
have
been
affected
and
you
look
out
at
the
landscape
and
there
have
to
be
moments
where
you
just
say
where
to
begin
how
to
start
there
are
going
to
be
moments
where
after
the
shock
has
worn
off
you
feel
alone
but
no
doubt
in
my
mind
what
the
people
of
this
community
can
do
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
will
rebuild
and
as
president
can
promise
you
your
country
will
be
there
with
you
every
single
step
of
the
way
we
will
be
with
you
every
step
of
the
way
not
going
anywhere
the
cameras
may
leave
the
spotlight
may
shift
but
we
will
be
with
you
every
step
of
the
way
until
is
restored
and
this
community
is
back
on
its
feet
not
going
anywhere
that
is
not
just
my
promise
promise
promise
make
here
in
promise
made
down
in
or
in
any
of
the
communities
that
have
been
hit
by
these
devastating
storms
over
the
last
few
weeks
now
there
have
been
countless
acts
of
kindness
and
in
recent
days
already
heard
the
record
of
some
of
that
but
perhaps
none
are
as
inspiring
as
what
took
place
when
the
storm
was
bearing
down
on
threatening
an
entire
community
with
utter
destruction
and
in
the
face
of
winds
that
showed
no
mercy
no
regard
for
human
life
that
did
not
discriminate
by
race
or
faith
or
background
it
was
ordinary
people
swiftly
tested
who
said
willing
to
die
right
now
so
that
someone
else
might
it
was
the
husband
who
threw
himself
over
his
wife
as
their
house
came
apart
around
them
it
was
the
mother
who
shielded
her
young
son
it
was
dean
wells
husband
and
father
who
loved
to
sing
and
whistle
in
his
church
choir
dean
was
working
shift
at
the
home
depot
managing
the
electrical
department
when
the
siren
rang
out
he
sprang
into
action
moving
people
to
safety
over
and
over
again
he
went
back
for
others
until
wall
came
down
on
top
of
him
in
the
end
most
of
the
building
was
destroyed
but
not
where
dean
had
directed
his
coworkers
and
his
customers
there
was
young
man
named
who
was
years
old
father
of
two
daughters
third
daughter
on
the
way
just
like
any
other
night
was
doing
his
job
as
manager
on
duty
at
pizza
hut
and
then
he
heard
the
storm
coming
it
was
then
when
this
former
sailor
quickly
ushered
everybody
into
the
freezer
the
only
problem
was
the
freezer
door
stay
closed
from
the
inside
so
as
the
tornado
bore
down
on
this
small
on
range
line
road
left
the
freezer
to
find
rope
or
cord
or
anything
to
hold
the
door
shut
he
made
it
back
just
in
time
tying
piece
of
bungee
cord
to
the
handle
outside
wrapping
the
other
end
around
his
arm
holding
the
door
closed
with
all
his
might
and
held
it
as
long
as
he
could
until
he
was
pulled
away
by
the
incredible
force
of
the
storm
he
died
saving
more
than
dozen
people
in
that
freezer
you
see
there
are
all
around
us
all
the
time
they
walk
by
us
on
the
sidewalk
and
they
sit
next
to
us
in
class
they
pass
us
in
the
aisle
wearing
an
orange
apron
they
come
to
our
table
at
restaurant
and
ask
us
what
like
to
order
just
as
we
know
why
tragedy
strikes
in
the
first
place
we
may
never
fully
understand
where
these
men
and
women
find
the
courage
and
strength
to
do
what
they
did
what
we
do
know
is
that
in
moment
where
little
time
for
internal
reflection
or
debate
the
actions
of
these
individuals
were
driven
by
love
love
for
family
member
love
for
friend
or
just
love
for
fellow
human
being
good
to
know
in
world
that
can
be
cruel
and
selfish
this
knowledge
the
knowledge
that
we
are
inclined
to
love
one
another
that
inclined
to
do
good
to
be
good
that
causes
us
to
take
heart
we
see
with
fresh
eyes
precious
and
so
fragile
and
so
important
to
us
we
put
aside
our
petty
grievances
and
our
minor
disagreements
we
see
ourselves
in
the
hopes
and
hardships
of
others
and
in
the
stories
of
people
like
dean
and
people
like
we
remember
that
each
us
contains
reserves
of
resolve
and
compassion
there
are
all
around
us
all
the
time
and
so
in
the
wake
of
this
tragedy
let
us
live
up
to
their
example
to
make
each
day
count
to
live
with
the
sense
of
mutual
regard
to
live
with
that
same
compassion
that
they
demonstrated
in
their
final
hours
we
are
called
by
them
to
do
everything
we
can
to
be
worthy
of
the
chance
that
been
given
to
carry
on
understand
that
at
memorial
yesterday
for
dean
his
wife
decided
to
play
recording
of
dean
whistling
song
he
loved
amazing
grace
the
lyrics
are
fitting
tribute
to
what
has
been
through
through
many
dangers
toils
and
snares
have
already
come
grace
that
brought
me
safe
thus
far
and
grace
will
lead
me
yea
when
this
flesh
and
heart
shall
fail
and
mortal
life
shall
cease
shall
possess
within
the
veil
life
of
joy
and
peace
may
those
lost
know
peace
and
may
grace
guide
the
people
of
home
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
you
so
much
my
lord
chancellor
speaker
prime
minister
my
lords
and
members
of
the
house
of
commons
have
known
few
greater
honors
than
the
opportunity
to
address
the
mother
of
parliaments
at
hall
am
told
that
the
last
three
speakers
here
have
been
the
pope
her
majesty
the
queen
and
mandela
which
is
either
very
high
bar
or
the
beginning
of
very
funny
joke
come
here
today
to
reaffirm
one
of
the
oldest
one
of
the
strongest
alliances
the
world
has
ever
known
long
been
said
that
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
share
special
relationship
and
since
we
also
share
an
especially
active
press
corps
that
relationship
is
often
and
for
the
slightest
hint
of
stress
or
strain
of
course
all
relationships
have
their
ups
and
downs
admittedly
ours
got
off
on
the
wrong
foot
with
small
scrape
about
tea
and
taxes
there
may
also
have
been
some
hurt
feelings
when
the
white
house
was
set
on
fire
during
the
war
of
but
fortunately
been
smooth
sailing
ever
since
the
reason
for
this
close
friendship
just
have
to
do
with
our
shared
history
our
shared
heritage
our
ties
of
language
and
culture
or
even
the
strong
partnership
between
our
governments
our
relationship
is
special
because
of
the
values
and
beliefs
that
have
united
our
people
through
the
ages
centuries
ago
when
kings
emperors
and
warlords
reigned
over
much
of
the
world
it
was
the
english
who
first
spelled
out
the
rights
and
liberties
of
man
in
the
it
was
here
in
this
very
hall
where
the
rule
of
law
first
developed
courts
were
established
disputes
were
settled
and
citizens
came
to
petition
their
leaders
over
time
the
people
of
this
nation
waged
long
and
sometimes
bloody
struggle
to
expand
and
secure
their
freedom
from
the
crown
propelled
by
the
ideals
of
the
enlightenment
they
would
ultimately
forge
an
english
bill
of
rights
and
invest
the
power
to
govern
in
an
elected
parliament
gathered
here
today
what
began
on
this
island
would
inspire
millions
throughout
the
continent
of
europe
and
across
the
world
but
perhaps
no
one
drew
greater
inspiration
from
these
notions
of
freedom
than
your
colonists
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
as
said
the
the
bill
of
rights
corpus
trial
by
jury
and
english
common
law
find
their
most
famous
expression
in
the
american
declaration
of
independence
for
both
of
our
nations
living
up
to
the
ideals
enshrined
in
these
founding
documents
has
sometimes
been
difficult
has
always
been
work
in
progress
the
path
has
never
been
perfect
but
through
the
struggles
of
slaves
and
immigrants
women
and
ethnic
minorities
former
colonies
and
persecuted
religions
we
have
learned
better
than
most
that
the
longing
for
freedom
and
human
dignity
is
not
english
or
american
or
western
it
is
universal
and
it
beats
in
every
heart
perhaps
why
there
are
few
nations
that
stand
firmer
speak
louder
and
fight
harder
to
defend
democratic
values
around
the
world
than
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
we
are
the
allies
who
landed
at
and
gold
who
sacrificed
side
by
side
to
free
continent
from
the
march
of
tyranny
and
help
prosperity
flourish
from
the
ruins
of
war
and
with
the
founding
of
nato
british
idea
we
joined
transatlantic
alliance
that
has
ensured
our
security
for
over
half
century
together
with
our
allies
we
forged
lasting
peace
from
cold
war
when
the
iron
curtain
lifted
we
expanded
our
alliance
to
include
the
nations
of
central
and
eastern
europe
and
built
new
bridges
to
russia
and
the
former
states
of
the
soviet
union
and
when
there
was
strife
in
the
we
worked
together
to
keep
the
peace
today
after
difficult
decade
that
began
with
war
and
ended
in
recession
our
nations
have
arrived
at
pivotal
moment
once
more
global
economy
that
once
stood
on
the
brink
of
depression
is
now
stable
and
recovering
after
years
of
conflict
the
united
states
has
removed
troops
from
iraq
the
united
kingdom
has
removed
its
forces
and
our
combat
mission
there
has
ended
in
broken
the
momentum
and
will
soon
begin
transition
to
afghan
lead
and
nearly
years
after
we
have
disrupted
terrorist
networks
and
dealt
huge
blow
by
killing
its
leader
bin
laden
together
we
have
met
great
challenges
but
as
we
enter
this
new
chapter
in
our
shared
history
profound
challenges
stretch
before
us
in
world
where
the
prosperity
of
all
nations
is
now
inextricably
linked
new
era
of
cooperation
is
required
to
ensure
the
growth
and
stability
of
the
global
economy
as
new
threats
spread
across
borders
and
oceans
we
must
dismantle
terrorist
networks
and
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
confront
climate
change
and
combat
famine
and
disease
and
as
revolution
races
through
the
streets
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
the
entire
world
has
stake
in
the
aspirations
of
generation
that
longs
to
determine
its
own
destiny
these
challenges
come
at
time
when
the
international
order
has
already
been
reshaped
for
new
century
countries
like
china
india
and
brazil
are
growing
by
leaps
and
bounds
we
should
welcome
this
development
for
it
has
lifted
hundreds
of
millions
from
poverty
around
the
globe
and
created
new
markets
and
opportunities
for
our
own
nations
and
yet
as
this
rapid
change
has
taken
place
become
fashionable
in
some
quarters
to
question
whether
the
rise
of
these
nations
will
accompany
the
decline
of
american
and
european
influence
around
the
world
perhaps
the
argument
goes
these
nations
represent
the
future
and
the
time
for
our
leadership
has
passed
that
argument
is
wrong
the
time
for
our
leadership
is
now
it
was
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
and
our
democratic
allies
that
shaped
world
in
which
new
nations
could
emerge
and
individuals
could
thrive
and
even
as
more
nations
take
on
the
responsibilities
of
global
leadership
our
alliance
will
remain
indispensable
to
the
goal
of
century
that
is
more
peaceful
more
prosperous
and
more
just
at
time
when
threats
and
challenges
require
nations
to
work
in
concert
with
one
another
we
remain
the
greatest
catalysts
for
global
action
in
an
era
defined
by
the
rapid
flow
of
commerce
and
information
it
is
our
free
market
tradition
our
openness
fortified
by
our
commitment
to
basic
security
for
our
citizens
that
offers
the
best
chance
of
prosperity
that
is
both
strong
and
shared
as
millions
are
still
denied
their
basic
human
rights
because
of
who
they
are
or
what
they
believe
or
the
kind
of
government
that
they
live
under
we
are
the
nations
most
willing
to
stand
up
for
the
values
of
tolerance
and
that
lead
to
peace
and
dignity
now
this
mean
we
can
afford
to
stand
still
the
nature
of
our
leadership
will
need
to
change
with
the
times
as
said
the
first
time
came
to
london
as
president
for
the
summit
the
days
are
gone
when
and
could
sit
in
room
and
solve
the
problems
over
glass
of
brandy
although
sure
that
prime
minister
would
agree
that
some
days
we
could
both
use
stiff
drink
in
this
century
our
joint
leadership
will
require
building
new
partnerships
adapting
to
new
circumstances
and
remaking
ourselves
to
meet
the
demands
of
new
era
that
begins
with
our
economic
leadership
adam
central
insight
remains
true
today
there
is
no
greater
generator
of
wealth
and
innovation
than
system
of
free
enterprise
that
unleashes
the
full
potential
of
individual
men
and
women
what
led
to
the
industrial
revolution
that
began
in
the
factories
of
that
is
what
led
to
the
dawn
of
the
information
age
that
arose
from
the
office
parks
of
silicon
valley
why
countries
like
china
india
and
brazil
are
growing
so
rapidly
because
in
fits
and
starts
they
are
moving
toward
principles
that
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
have
always
embraced
in
other
words
we
live
in
global
economy
that
is
largely
of
our
own
making
and
today
the
competition
for
the
best
jobs
and
industries
countries
that
are
and
countries
with
the
most
creative
and
innovative
and
entrepreneurial
citizens
that
gives
nations
like
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
an
inherent
advantage
for
from
newton
and
darwin
to
edison
and
einstein
from
to
jobs
we
have
led
the
world
in
our
commitment
to
science
and
research
the
discovery
of
new
medicines
and
technologies
we
educate
our
citizens
and
train
our
workers
in
the
best
colleges
and
universities
on
earth
but
to
maintain
this
advantage
in
world
more
competitive
than
ever
we
will
have
to
redouble
our
investments
in
science
and
engineering
and
renew
our
national
commitments
to
educating
our
workforces
also
been
reminded
in
the
last
few
years
that
markets
can
sometimes
fail
in
the
last
century
both
our
nations
put
in
place
regulatory
frameworks
to
deal
with
such
market
failures
safeguards
to
protect
the
banking
system
after
the
great
depression
for
example
regulations
that
were
established
to
prevent
the
pollution
of
our
air
and
water
during
the
but
in
economy
such
threats
of
market
failure
can
no
longer
be
contained
within
the
borders
of
any
one
country
market
failures
can
go
global
and
go
viral
and
demand
international
responses
financial
crisis
that
began
on
wall
street
infected
nearly
every
continent
which
is
why
we
must
keep
working
through
forums
like
the
to
put
in
place
global
rules
of
the
road
to
prevent
future
excesses
and
abuse
no
country
can
hide
from
the
dangers
of
carbon
pollution
which
is
why
we
must
build
on
what
was
achieved
at
and
to
leave
our
children
planet
that
is
safer
and
cleaner
moreover
even
when
the
free
market
works
as
it
should
both
our
countries
that
no
matter
how
responsibly
we
live
in
our
lives
hard
times
or
bad
luck
crippling
illness
or
layoff
may
strike
any
one
of
us
and
so
part
of
our
common
tradition
has
expressed
itself
in
conviction
that
every
citizen
deserves
basic
measure
of
security
health
care
if
you
get
sick
unemployment
insurance
if
you
lose
your
job
dignified
retirement
after
lifetime
of
hard
work
that
commitment
to
our
citizens
has
also
been
the
reason
for
our
leadership
in
the
world
and
now
having
come
through
terrible
recession
our
challenge
is
to
meet
these
obligations
while
ensuring
that
not
consuming
and
hence
consumed
with
level
of
debt
that
could
sap
the
strength
and
vitality
of
our
economies
and
that
will
require
difficult
choices
and
it
will
require
different
paths
for
both
of
our
countries
but
we
have
faced
such
challenges
before
and
have
always
been
able
to
balance
the
need
for
fiscal
responsibility
with
the
responsibilities
we
have
to
one
another
and
believe
we
can
do
this
again
as
we
do
the
successes
and
failures
of
our
own
past
can
serve
as
an
example
for
emerging
economies
that
possible
to
grow
without
polluting
that
lasting
prosperity
comes
not
from
what
nation
consumes
but
from
what
it
produces
and
from
the
investments
it
makes
in
its
people
and
its
infrastructure
and
just
as
we
must
lead
on
behalf
of
the
prosperity
of
our
citizens
so
we
must
safeguard
their
security
our
two
nations
know
what
it
is
to
confront
evil
in
the
world
armies
would
not
have
stopped
their
killing
had
we
not
fought
them
on
the
beaches
and
on
the
landing
grounds
in
the
fields
and
on
the
streets
we
must
never
forget
that
there
was
nothing
inevitable
about
our
victory
in
that
terrible
war
it
was
won
through
the
courage
and
character
of
our
people
precisely
because
we
are
willing
to
bear
its
burden
we
know
well
the
cost
of
war
and
that
is
why
we
built
an
alliance
that
was
strong
enough
to
defend
this
continent
while
deterring
our
enemies
at
its
core
nato
is
rooted
in
the
simple
concept
of
article
five
that
no
nato
nation
will
have
to
fend
on
its
own
that
allies
will
stand
by
one
another
always
and
for
six
decades
nato
has
been
the
most
successful
alliance
in
human
history
today
we
confront
different
enemy
terrorists
have
taken
the
lives
of
our
citizens
in
new
york
and
in
london
and
while
seeks
religious
war
with
the
west
we
must
remember
that
they
have
killed
thousands
of
muslims
men
women
and
children
around
the
globe
our
nations
are
not
and
will
never
be
at
war
with
islam
our
fight
is
focused
on
defeating
and
its
extremist
allies
in
that
effort
we
will
not
relent
as
bin
laden
and
his
followers
have
learned
and
as
we
fight
an
enemy
that
respects
no
law
of
war
we
will
continue
to
hold
ourselves
to
higher
standard
by
living
up
to
the
values
the
rule
of
law
and
due
process
that
we
so
ardently
defend
for
almost
decade
has
been
central
front
of
these
efforts
throughout
those
years
you
the
british
people
have
been
stalwart
ally
along
with
so
many
others
who
fight
by
our
side
together
let
us
pay
tribute
to
all
of
our
men
and
women
who
have
served
and
sacrificed
over
the
last
several
years
for
they
are
part
of
an
unbroken
line
of
who
have
borne
the
heaviest
burden
for
the
freedoms
that
we
enjoy
because
of
them
we
have
broken
the
momentum
because
of
them
we
have
built
the
capacity
of
afghan
security
forces
and
because
of
them
we
are
now
preparing
to
turn
corner
in
by
to
afghan
lead
and
during
this
transition
we
will
pursue
lasting
peace
with
those
who
break
free
of
and
respect
the
afghan
constitution
and
lay
down
arms
and
we
will
ensure
that
is
never
safe
haven
for
terror
but
is
instead
country
that
is
strong
sovereign
and
able
to
stand
on
its
own
two
feet
indeed
our
efforts
in
this
young
century
have
led
us
to
new
concept
for
nato
that
will
give
us
the
capabilities
needed
to
meet
new
threats
threats
like
terrorism
and
piracy
attacks
and
ballistic
missiles
but
nato
will
continue
to
hew
to
that
original
vision
of
its
founders
allowing
us
to
rally
collective
action
for
the
of
our
people
while
building
upon
the
broader
belief
of
and
that
all
nations
have
both
rights
and
responsibilities
and
all
nations
share
common
interest
in
an
international
architecture
that
maintains
the
peace
we
also
share
common
interest
in
stopping
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
across
the
globe
nations
are
locking
down
nuclear
materials
so
they
never
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
because
of
our
leadership
from
north
korea
to
iran
sent
message
that
those
who
flaunt
their
obligations
will
face
consequences
which
is
why
america
and
the
european
union
just
recently
strengthened
our
sanctions
on
iran
in
large
part
because
of
the
leadership
of
the
united
kingdom
and
the
united
states
and
while
we
hold
others
to
account
we
will
meet
our
own
obligations
under
the
treaty
and
strive
for
world
without
nuclear
weapons
we
share
common
interest
in
resolving
conflicts
that
prolong
human
suffering
and
threaten
to
tear
whole
regions
asunder
in
sudan
after
years
of
war
and
thousands
of
deaths
we
call
on
both
north
and
south
to
pull
back
from
the
brink
of
violence
and
choose
the
path
of
peace
and
in
the
middle
east
we
stand
united
in
our
support
for
secure
israel
and
sovereign
and
we
share
common
interest
in
development
that
advances
dignity
and
security
to
succeed
we
must
cast
aside
the
impulse
to
look
at
impoverished
parts
of
the
globe
as
place
for
charity
instead
we
should
empower
the
same
forces
that
have
allowed
our
own
people
to
thrive
we
should
help
the
hungry
to
feed
themselves
the
doctors
who
care
for
the
sick
we
should
support
countries
that
confront
corruption
and
allow
their
people
to
innovate
and
we
should
advance
the
truth
that
nations
prosper
when
they
allow
women
and
girls
to
reach
their
full
potential
we
do
these
things
because
we
believe
not
simply
in
the
rights
of
nations
we
believe
in
the
rights
of
citizens
that
is
the
beacon
that
guided
us
through
our
fight
against
fascism
and
our
twilight
struggle
against
communism
and
today
that
idea
is
being
put
to
the
test
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
in
country
after
country
people
are
to
free
themselves
from
the
grip
of
an
iron
fist
and
while
these
movements
for
change
are
just
six
months
old
we
have
seen
them
play
out
before
from
eastern
europe
to
the
from
south
africa
to
asia
history
tells
us
that
democracy
is
not
easy
it
will
be
years
before
these
revolutions
reach
their
conclusion
and
there
will
be
difficult
days
along
the
way
power
rarely
gives
up
without
fight
particularly
in
places
where
there
are
divisions
of
tribe
and
divisions
of
sect
we
also
know
that
populism
can
take
dangerous
turns
from
the
extremism
of
those
who
would
use
democracy
to
deny
minority
rights
to
the
nationalism
that
left
so
many
scars
on
this
continent
in
the
century
but
make
no
mistake
what
we
saw
what
we
are
seeing
in
in
in
square
is
longing
for
the
same
freedoms
that
we
take
for
granted
here
at
home
it
was
rejection
of
the
notion
that
people
in
certain
parts
of
the
world
want
to
be
free
or
need
to
have
democracy
imposed
upon
them
it
was
rebuke
to
the
of
which
smothers
the
rights
of
individuals
and
would
thereby
subject
them
to
perpetual
poverty
and
violence
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
united
states
and
united
kingdom
stand
squarely
on
the
side
of
those
who
long
to
be
free
and
now
we
must
show
that
we
will
back
up
those
words
with
deeds
that
means
investing
in
the
future
of
those
nations
that
transition
to
democracy
starting
with
tunisia
and
egypt
by
deepening
ties
of
trade
and
commerce
by
helping
them
demonstrate
that
freedom
brings
prosperity
and
that
means
standing
up
for
universal
rights
by
sanctioning
those
who
pursue
repression
strengthening
civil
society
supporting
the
rights
of
minorities
we
do
this
knowing
that
the
west
must
overcome
suspicion
and
mistrust
among
many
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
mistrust
that
is
rooted
in
difficult
past
for
years
faced
charges
of
hypocrisy
from
those
who
do
not
enjoy
the
freedoms
that
they
hear
us
espouse
and
so
to
them
we
must
squarely
acknowledge
that
yes
we
have
enduring
interests
in
the
region
to
fight
terror
sometimes
with
partners
who
may
not
be
perfect
to
protect
against
disruptions
of
the
energy
supply
but
we
must
also
insist
that
we
reject
as
false
the
choice
between
our
interests
and
our
ideals
between
stability
and
democracy
for
our
idealism
is
rooted
in
the
realities
of
history
that
repression
offers
only
the
false
promise
of
stability
that
societies
are
more
successful
when
their
citizens
are
free
and
that
democracies
are
the
closest
allies
we
have
it
is
that
truth
that
guides
our
action
in
libya
it
would
have
been
easy
at
the
outset
of
the
crackdown
in
libya
to
say
that
none
of
this
was
our
business
that
sovereignty
is
more
important
than
the
slaughter
of
civilians
within
its
borders
that
argument
carries
weight
with
some
but
we
are
different
we
embrace
broader
responsibility
and
while
we
can
not
stop
every
injustice
there
are
circumstances
that
cut
through
our
caution
when
leader
is
threatening
to
massacre
his
people
and
the
international
community
is
calling
for
action
why
we
stopped
massacre
in
libya
and
we
will
not
relent
until
the
people
of
libya
are
protected
and
the
shadow
of
tyranny
is
lifted
we
will
proceed
with
humility
and
the
knowledge
that
we
can
not
dictate
every
outcome
abroad
ultimately
freedom
must
be
won
by
the
people
themselves
not
imposed
from
without
but
we
can
and
must
stand
with
those
who
so
struggle
because
we
have
always
believed
that
the
future
of
our
children
and
grandchildren
will
be
better
if
other
children
and
grandchildren
are
more
prosperous
and
more
free
from
the
beaches
of
normandy
to
the
to
that
is
our
interests
and
our
ideals
and
if
we
fail
to
meet
that
responsibility
who
would
take
our
place
and
what
kind
of
world
would
we
pass
on
our
action
our
leadership
is
essential
to
the
cause
of
human
dignity
and
so
we
must
act
and
lead
with
confidence
in
our
ideals
and
an
abiding
faith
in
the
character
of
our
people
who
sent
us
all
here
today
for
there
is
one
final
quality
that
believe
makes
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
indispensable
to
this
moment
in
history
and
that
is
how
we
define
ourselves
as
nations
unlike
most
countries
in
the
world
we
do
not
define
citizenship
based
on
race
or
ethnicity
being
american
or
british
is
not
about
belonging
to
certain
group
about
believing
in
certain
set
of
ideals
the
rights
of
individuals
the
rule
of
law
that
is
why
we
hold
incredible
diversity
within
our
borders
why
there
are
people
around
the
world
right
now
who
believe
that
if
they
come
to
america
if
they
come
to
new
york
if
they
come
to
london
if
they
work
hard
they
can
pledge
allegiance
to
our
flag
and
call
themselves
americans
if
they
come
to
england
they
can
make
new
life
for
themselves
and
can
sing
god
save
the
queen
just
like
any
other
citizen
yes
our
diversity
can
lead
to
tension
and
throughout
our
history
there
have
been
heated
debates
about
immigration
and
assimilation
in
both
of
our
countries
but
even
as
these
debates
can
be
difficult
we
fundamentally
that
our
patchwork
heritage
is
an
enormous
strength
that
in
world
which
will
only
grow
smaller
and
more
interconnected
the
example
of
our
two
nations
says
it
is
possible
for
people
to
be
united
by
their
ideals
instead
of
divided
by
their
differences
that
possible
for
hearts
to
change
and
old
hatreds
to
pass
that
possible
for
the
sons
and
daughters
of
former
colonies
to
sit
here
as
members
of
this
great
parliament
and
for
the
grandson
of
kenyan
who
served
as
cook
in
the
british
army
to
stand
before
you
as
president
of
the
united
states
that
is
what
defines
us
that
is
why
the
young
men
and
women
in
the
streets
of
damascus
and
cairo
still
reach
for
the
rights
our
citizens
enjoy
even
if
they
sometimes
differ
with
our
policies
as
two
of
the
most
powerful
nations
in
the
history
of
the
world
we
must
always
remember
that
the
true
source
of
our
influence
just
been
the
size
of
our
economies
or
the
reach
of
our
or
the
land
that
claimed
it
has
been
the
values
that
we
must
never
waver
in
defending
around
the
world
the
idea
that
all
beings
are
endowed
by
our
creator
with
certain
rights
that
can
not
be
denied
that
is
what
forged
our
bond
in
the
fire
of
war
bond
made
manifest
by
the
friendship
between
two
of
our
greatest
leaders
and
had
their
differences
they
were
keen
observers
of
each
blind
spots
and
shortcomings
if
not
always
their
own
and
they
were
about
their
ability
to
remake
the
world
but
what
joined
the
fates
of
these
two
men
at
that
particular
moment
in
history
was
not
simply
shared
interest
in
victory
on
the
battlefield
it
was
shared
belief
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
human
freedom
and
human
dignity
conviction
that
we
have
say
in
how
this
story
ends
this
conviction
lives
on
in
their
people
today
the
challenges
we
face
are
great
the
work
before
us
is
hard
but
we
have
come
through
difficult
decade
and
whenever
the
tests
and
trials
ahead
may
seem
too
big
or
too
many
let
us
turn
to
their
example
and
the
words
that
spoke
on
the
day
that
europe
was
freed
in
the
long
years
to
come
not
only
will
the
people
of
this
island
world
wherever
the
bird
of
freedom
chirps
in
the
human
heart
look
back
to
what
done
and
they
will
say
not
despair
do
not
with
courage
and
purpose
with
humility
and
with
hope
with
faith
in
the
promise
of
tomorrow
let
us
march
straightforward
together
enduring
allies
in
the
cause
of
world
that
is
more
peaceful
more
prosperous

more
just

the
past
four
years

going
to
be
an
outstanding
ambassador
to
israel
dan
dan
has
always
been
close
and
trusted
and
friend
and
know
that
he
will
do
terrific
job
and
at
time
when
so
many
young
people
around
the
world
are
standing
up
and
making
their
voices
heard
also
want
to
acknowledge
all
the
college
students
from
across
the
country
who
are
here
today
no
one
has
greater
stake
in
the
outcome
of
events
that
are
unfolding
today
than
your
generation
and
inspiring
to
see
you
devote
your
time
and
energy
to
help
shape
that
future
now
not
here
to
subject
you
to
long
policy
gave
one
on
thursday
in
which
said
that
the
united
states
sees
the
historic
changes
sweeping
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
as
moment
of
great
challenge
but
also
moment
of
opportunity
for
greater
peace
and
security
for
the
entire
region
including
the
state
of
israel
on
friday
was
joined
at
the
white
house
by
prime
minister
and
we
reaffirmed
we
reaffirmed
that
fundamental
truth
that
has
guided
our
presidents
and
prime
ministers
for
more
than
years
that
even
while
we
may
at
times
disagree
as
friends
sometimes
will
the
bonds
between
the
united
states
and
israel
are
unbreakable
and
the
commitment
of
the
united
states
to
the
security
of
israel
is
strong
and
secure
israel
is
in
the
national
security
interest
of
the
united
states
not
simply
because
we
share
strategic
interests
although
we
do
both
seek
region
where
families
and
children
can
live
free
from
the
threat
of
violence
not
simply
because
we
face
common
dangers
although
there
can
be
no
denying
that
terrorism
and
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
are
grave
threats
to
both
our
nations
commitment
to
security
flows
from
deeper
place
and
the
values
we
share
as
two
people
who
struggled
to
win
our
freedom
against
overwhelming
odds
we
understand
that
preserving
the
security
for
which
our
forefathers
and
fought
must
be
the
work
of
every
generation
as
two
vibrant
democracies
we
that
the
liberties
and
freedoms
we
cherish
must
be
constantly
nurtured
and
as
the
nation
that
the
state
of
israel
moments
after
its
independence
we
have
profound
commitment
to
its
survival
as
strong
secure
homeland
for
the
jewish
people
we
also
know
how
difficult
that
search
for
security
can
be
especially
for
small
nation
like
israel
living
in
very
tough
seen
it
firsthand
when
touched
my
hand
against
the
western
wall
and
placed
my
prayer
between
its
ancient
stones
thought
of
all
the
centuries
that
the
children
of
israel
had
longed
to
return
to
their
ancient
homeland
when
went
to
and
saw
the
daily
struggle
to
survive
in
the
eyes
of
an
boy
who
lost
his
leg
to
rocket
and
when
walked
among
the
hall
of
names
at
was
reminded
of
the
existential
fear
of
israelis
when
modern
dictator
seeks
nuclear
weapons
and
threatens
to
wipe
israel
off
the
face
of
the
map
face
of
the
earth
because
we
understand
the
challenges
israel
faces
and
my
administration
have
made
the
security
of
israel
priority
why
increased
cooperation
between
our
to
unprecedented
levels
why
making
our
most
advanced
technologies
available
to
our
israeli
allies
why
despite
tough
fiscal
times
increased
foreign
military
financing
to
record
levels
and
that
includes
additional
support
beyond
regular
military
aid
for
the
iron
dome
system
powerful
example
of
cooperation
powerful
example
of
cooperation
which
has
already
intercepted
rockets
from
and
helped
saved
israeli
lives
so
make
no
mistake
we
will
maintain
qualitative
military
edge
you
also
see
our
commitment
to
our
shared
security
in
our
determination
to
prevent
iran
from
acquiring
nuclear
weapons
here
in
the
united
states
imposed
the
toughest
sanctions
ever
on
the
iranian
regime
at
the
united
nations
under
our
leadership
secured
the
most
comprehensive
international
sanctions
on
the
regime
which
have
been
joined
by
allies
and
partners
around
the
world
today
iran
is
virtually
cut
off
from
large
parts
of
the
international
financial
system
and
going
to
keep
up
the
pressure
so
let
me
be
absolutely
clear
we
remain
committed
to
preventing
iran
from
acquiring
nuclear
weapons
its
illicit
nuclear
program
is
just
one
challenge
that
iran
poses
as
said
on
thursday
the
iranian
government
has
shown
its
hypocrisy
by
claiming
to
support
the
rights
of
protesters
while
treating
its
own
people
with
brutality
moreover
iran
continues
to
support
terrorism
across
the
region
including
providing
weapons
and
funds
to
terrorist
so
we
will
continue
to
work
to
prevent
these
actions
and
we
will
stand
up
to
groups
like
who
exercise
political
assassination
and
seek
to
impose
their
will
through
rockets
and
car
bombs
you
also
see
our
commitment
to
security
in
our
steadfast
opposition
to
any
attempt
to
the
state
of
israel
as
said
at
the
united
nations
last
year
existence
must
not
be
subject
for
debate
and
efforts
to
chip
away
at
legitimacy
will
only
be
met
by
the
unshakeable
opposition
of
the
united
states
so
when
the
durban
review
conference
advanced
sentiment
we
withdrew
in
the
wake
of
the
report
we
stood
up
strongly
for
right
to
defend
itself
when
an
effort
was
made
to
insert
the
united
nations
into
matters
that
should
be
resolved
through
direct
negotiations
between
israelis
and
we
vetoed
it
and
so
in
both
word
and
deed
we
have
been
unwavering
in
our
support
of
security
and
it
is
precisely
because
of
our
commitment
to
security
that
we
have
worked
to
advance
peace
between
israelis
and
now
have
said
repeatedly
that
core
issues
can
only
be
negotiated
in
direct
talks
between
the
parties
and
indicated
on
thursday
that
the
recent
agreement
between
and
poses
an
enormous
obstacle
to
peace
no
country
can
be
expected
to
negotiate
with
terrorist
sworn
to
its
destruction
and
we
will
continue
to
demand
that
accept
the
basic
responsibilities
of
peace
including
right
to
exist
and
rejecting
violence
and
adhering
to
all
existing
agreements
and
we
once
again
call
on
to
release
who
has
been
kept
from
his
family
for
five
long
years
and
yet
no
matter
how
hard
it
may
be
to
start
meaningful
negotiations
under
current
circumstances
we
must
acknowledge
that
failure
to
try
is
not
an
option
the
status
is
unsustainable
and
that
is
why
on
thursday
stated
publicly
the
principles
that
the
united
states
believes
can
provide
foundation
for
negotiations
toward
an
agreement
to
end
the
conflict
and
all
claims
the
broad
outlines
of
which
have
been
known
for
many
years
and
have
been
the
template
for
discussions
between
the
united
states
israel
and
the
since
at
least
the
administration
know
that
stating
these
principles
on
the
issues
of
territory
and
security
generated
some
controversy
over
the
past
few
days
surprised
know
very
well
that
the
easy
thing
to
do
particularly
for
president
preparing
for
is
to
avoid
any
controversy
need
to
tell
me
that
need
to
tell
me
that
but
said
to
prime
minister
believe
that
the
current
situation
in
the
middle
east
does
not
allow
for
procrastination
also
believe
that
real
friends
talk
openly
and
honestly
with
one
another
so
want
to
share
with
you
some
of
what
said
to
the
prime
minister
here
are
the
facts
we
all
must
confront
first
the
number
of
living
west
of
the
river
is
growing
rapidly
and
fundamentally
reshaping
the
demographic
realities
of
both
israel
and
the
territories
this
will
make
it
harder
and
harder
without
peace
deal
to
maintain
israel
as
both
jewish
state
and
democratic
state
second
technology
will
make
it
harder
for
israel
to
defend
itself
in
the
absence
of
genuine
peace
third
new
generation
of
arabs
is
reshaping
the
region
just
and
lasting
peace
can
no
longer
be
forged
with
one
or
two
arab
leaders
going
forward
millions
of
arab
citizens
have
to
see
that
peace
is
possible
for
that
peace
to
be
sustained
and
just
as
the
context
has
changed
in
the
middle
east
so
too
has
it
been
changing
in
the
international
community
over
the
last
several
years
reason
why
the
are
pursuing
their
interests
at
the
united
nations
they
that
there
is
an
impatience
with
the
peace
process
or
the
absence
of
one
not
just
in
the
arab
world
in
latin
america
in
asia
and
in
europe
and
that
impatience
is
growing
and
already
manifesting
itself
in
capitals
around
the
world
and
those
are
the
facts
firmly
believe
and
repeated
on
thursday
that
peace
can
not
be
imposed
on
the
parties
to
the
conflict
no
vote
at
the
united
nations
will
ever
create
an
independent
state
and
the
united
states
will
stand
up
against
efforts
to
single
israel
out
at
the
united
nations
or
in
any
international
forum
legitimacy
is
not
matter
for
debate
that
is
my
commitment
that
is
my
pledge
to
all
of
you
moreover
we
know
that
peace
demands
partner
which
is
why
said
that
israel
can
not
be
expected
to
negotiate
with
who
do
not
its
right
to
exist
and
we
will
hold
the
accountable
for
their
actions
and
for
their
rhetoric
but
the
march
to
isolate
israel
internationally
and
the
impulse
of
the
to
abandon
negotiations
will
continue
to
gain
momentum
in
the
absence
of
credible
peace
process
and
alternative
and
for
us
to
have
leverage
with
the
to
have
leverage
with
the
arab
states
and
with
the
international
community
the
basis
for
negotiations
has
to
hold
out
the
prospect
of
success
and
so
in
advance
of
trip
to
europe
in
which
the
middle
east
will
be
topic
of
acute
interest
chose
to
speak
about
what
peace
will
require
there
was
nothing
particularly
original
in
my
proposal
this
basic
framework
for
negotiations
has
long
been
the
basis
for
discussions
among
the
parties
including
previous
administrations
since
questions
have
been
raised
let
me
repeat
what
actually
said
on
thursday
not
what
was
reported
to
have
said
said
that
the
united
states
believes
that
negotiations
should
result
in
two
states
with
permanent
borders
with
israel
and
egypt
and
permanent
israeli
borders
with
the
borders
of
israel
and
should
be
based
on
the
lines
with
mutually
agreed
swaps
so
that
secure
and
borders
are
established
for
both
states
the
people
must
have
the
right
to
govern
themselves
and
reach
their
potential
in
sovereign
and
contiguous
state
as
for
security
every
state
has
the
right
to
and
israel
must
be
able
to
defend
itself
by
itself
against
any
threat
provisions
must
also
be
robust
enough
to
prevent
resurgence
of
terrorism
to
stop
the
infiltration
of
weapons
and
to
provide
effective
border
security
and
full
and
phased
withdrawal
of
israeli
military
forces
should
be
coordinated
with
the
assumption
of
security
responsibility
in
sovereign
and
state
and
the
duration
of
this
transition
period
must
be
agreed
and
the
effectiveness
of
security
arrangements
must
be
demonstrated
now
that
is
what
said
and
it
was
my
reference
to
the
lines
with
mutually
agreed
swaps
that
received
the
share
of
the
attention
including
just
now
and
since
my
position
has
been
misrepresented
several
times
let
me
reaffirm
what
lines
with
mutually
agreed
means
by
definition
it
means
that
the
parties
themselves
israelis
and
will
negotiate
border
that
is
different
than
the
one
that
existed
on
june
what
mutually
swaps
means
it
is
formula
to
all
who
have
worked
on
this
issue
for
generation
it
allows
the
parties
themselves
to
account
for
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
over
the
last
years
it
allows
the
parties
themselves
to
take
account
of
those
changes
including
the
new
demographic
realities
on
the
ground
and
the
needs
of
both
sides
the
ultimate
goal
is
two
states
for
two
people
israel
as
jewish
state
and
the
homeland
for
the
jewish
people
and
the
state
of
as
the
homeland
for
the
people
each
state
in
joined
mutual
recognition
and
peace
if
there
is
controversy
then
not
based
in
substance
what
did
on
thursday
was
to
say
publicly
what
has
long
been
acknowledged
privately
done
so
because
we
afford
to
wait
another
decade
or
another
two
decades
or
another
three
decades
to
achieve
peace
the
world
is
moving
too
fast
the
world
is
moving
too
fast
the
extraordinary
challenges
facing
israel
will
only
grow
delay
will
undermine
security
and
the
peace
that
the
israeli
people
deserve
now
know
that
some
of
you
will
disagree
with
this
assessment
respect
that
and
as
fellow
americans
and
friends
of
israel
know
we
can
have
this
discussion
ultimately
it
is
the
right
and
the
responsibility
of
the
israeli
government
to
make
the
hard
choices
that
are
necessary
to
protect
jewish
and
democratic
state
for
which
so
many
generations
have
sacrificed
and
as
friend
of
israel
committed
to
doing
our
part
to
see
that
this
goal
is
and
will
call
not
just
on
israel
but
on
the
on
the
arab
states
and
the
international
community
to
join
us
in
this
effort
because
the
burden
of
making
hard
choices
must
not
be
alone
but
even
as
we
do
all
necessary
to
ensure
security
even
as
we
are
about
the
difficult
challenges
before
us
and
even
as
we
pledge
to
stand
by
israel
through
whatever
tough
days
lie
ahead
hope
we
do
not
give
up
on
that
vision
of
peace
for
if
history
teaches
us
anything
if
the
story
of
israel
teaches
us
anything
it
is
that
with
courage
and
resolve
progress
is
possible
peace
is
possible
the
talmud
teaches
us
that
so
long
as
person
still
has
life
they
should
never
abandon
faith
and
that
lesson
seems
especially
fitting
today
for
so
long
as
there
are
those
across
the
middle
east
and
beyond
who
are
standing
up
for
the
legitimate
rights
and
freedoms
which
have
been
denied
by
their
governments
the
united
states
will
never
abandon
our
support
for
those
rights
that
are
universal
and
so
long
as
there
are
those
who
long
for
better
future
we
will
never
abandon
our
pursuit
of
just
and
lasting
peace
that
ends
this
conflict
with
two
states
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
this
is
not
idealism
it
is
not
it
is
recognition
that
genuine
peace
is
the
only
path
that
will
ultimately
provide
for
peaceful
as
the
homeland
of
the
people
and
jewish
state
of
israel
as
the
homeland
of
the
jewish
people
that
is
my
goal
and
look
forward
to
continuing
to
work
with
to
achieve
that
goal
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
israel
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
well
thank
you
and
thank
you
when
chose
as
director
of
the
said
he
was
going
to
be
strong
advocate
for
this
agency
and
would
strengthen
your
capabilities
to
meet
the
threats
of
our
time
and
when
chose
clapper
as
director
of
national
intelligence
charged
him
with
making
sure
that
our
intelligence
community
works
as
one
integrated
team
exactly
what
these
two
leaders
have
done
along
with
all
of
you
so
and
thank
you
for
your
remarkable
leadership
not
just
in
recent
weeks
but
during
the
entirety
of
your
tenure
you
have
done
great
job
this
is
my
third
visit
here
to
as
president
and
each
of
these
visits
has
marked
another
milestone
in
our
mission
to
protect
the
american
people
and
keep
our
country
safe
on
my
first
visit
just
months
after
taking
office
stood
here
and
said
that
this
agency
and
our
entire
intelligence
community
is
fundamental
to
national
security
said
that
believed
that
your
best
days
were
still
to
come
and
pledged
that
you
would
have
my
full
support
to
carry
out
your
critical
work
soon
after
that
visit
called
into
the
oval
office
and
directed
him
to
make
the
killing
or
capture
of
bin
laden
the
top
priority
in
our
war
to
defeat
and
he
came
back
here
and
you
guys
who
had
already
been
working
so
hard
on
this
issue
redoubled
your
efforts
and
that
was
true
all
across
the
intelligence
community
my
second
visit
year
later
came
under
more
circumstances
we
gathered
to
pay
tribute
to
seven
american
patriots
who
gave
their
lives
in
this
fight
at
remote
post
in
as
has
already
been
mentioned
their
stars
now
grace
this
memorial
wall
and
through
our
grief
and
our
tears
we
resolved
that
their
sacrifice
would
be
our
summons
to
carry
on
their
work
to
complete
this
mission
to
win
this
war
today
returned
just
to
say
thank
you
on
behalf
of
all
americans
and
people
around
the
world
because
you
carried
on
you
stayed
focused
on
your
mission
you
the
memory
of
your
fallen
colleagues
and
in
helping
to
locate
and
take
down
bin
laden
you
made
it
possible
for
us
to
achieve
the
most
significant
victory
yet
in
our
war
to
defeat
just
met
with
some
of
the
outstanding
leaders
and
teams
from
across
the
community
who
worked
so
long
and
so
hard
to
make
that
raid
success
and
pleased
today
that
joined
by
representatives
from
all
of
our
intelligence
agencies
and
that
folks
are
watching
this
live
back
at
all
of
those
agencies
because
this
truly
was
team
effort
not
always
the
case
in
washington
but
all
of
you
work
together
every
single
day
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
when
all
these
leaders
and
have
the
occasion
to
appear
together
publicly
and
so
thank
all
of
you
for
coming
because
think
so
important
for
the
american
people
to
see
all
of
you
here
today
part
of
the
challenge
of
intelligence
work
is
by
necessity
your
work
has
to
remain
secret
know
that
carries
heavy
burden
often
the
first
ones
to
get
the
blame
when
things
go
wrong
and
always
the
last
ones
to
get
the
credit
when
things
go
right
so
when
things
do
go
right
and
they
do
more
often
than
the
world
will
ever
know
we
ought
to
celebrate
your
success
why
came
here
wanted
every
single
one
of
you
to
know
whether
you
work
at
the
or
across
the
community
at
every
step
of
our
effort
to
take
out
bin
laden
the
work
you
did
and
the
quality
of
the
intelligence
that
you
provided
made
the
critical
difference
to
me
to
our
team
on
those
helicopters
to
our
nation
after
directed
that
getting
bin
laden
be
the
priority
you
down
even
more
building
on
years
of
painstaking
work
pulling
together
in
some
cases
the
slenderest
of
intelligence
streams
running
those
threads
to
ground
until
you
found
that
courier
and
you
tracked
him
to
that
compound
and
when
was
briefed
last
summer
you
had
built
the
strongest
intelligence
case
against
in
terms
of
where
bin
laden
was
since
in
the
months
that
followed
including
all
those
meetings
in
the
situation
room
we
did
what
sound
intelligence
demands
we
pushed
for
more
collection
we
pushed
for
more
evidence
we
questioned
our
assumptions
you
strengthened
your
analysis
you
bite
your
tongue
and
try
to
spin
the
ball
but
you
gave
it
to
me
straight
each
and
every
time
and
we
did
something
really
remarkable
in
washington
we
kept
it
secret
how
it
should
be
of
course
when
the
time
came
to
actually
make
the
decision
we
know
for
sure
that
bin
laden
was
there
the
evidence
was
circumstantial
and
the
risks
especially
to
the
lives
of
our
special
operations
forces
were
huge
and
knew
that
the
consequences
of
failure
could
be
enormous
but
made
the
decision
that
did
because
had
absolute
confidence
in
the
skill
of
our
military
personnel
and
had
confidence
in
you
put
my
bet
on
you
and
now
the
whole
world
knows
that
that
faith
in
you
was
justified
so
just
as
impressive
as
what
you
did
was
how
you
did
it
it
was
tribute
to
your
perseverance
your
relentless
focus
and
determination
over
many
years
for
the
fight
against
did
not
begin
on
among
you
are
veterans
been
pursuing
these
murderers
for
many
years
even
before
they
attacked
our
embassies
in
africa
and
struck
the
cole
in
yemen
among
you
are
young
men
and
women
for
whom
was
call
to
service
this
fight
has
defined
your
generation
and
on
this
wall
are
stars
all
your
colleagues
and
friends
more
than
dozen
who
have
given
their
lives
in
the
fight
against
and
its
violent
allies
as
the
years
wore
on
others
began
to
think
that
this
terrorist
might
never
be
brought
to
justice
but
you
never
quit
you
never
gave
up
you
pulled
together
across
this
agency
and
across
the
community
no
one
piece
of
information
and
no
one
agency
made
this
possible
you
did
it
together
national
security
agency
national
reconnaissance
office
the
national
intelligence
agency
everyone
at
and
the
national
folks
across
the
country
civilian
and
military
so
many
of
you
here
today
and
exactly
how
our
intelligence
community
is
supposed
to
work
using
every
capability
human
technical
collecting
sharing
integrating
intelligence
and
then
acting
on
it
what
made
this
one
of
the
greatest
intelligence
successes
in
american
history
and
why
intelligence
professionals
are
going
to
study
and
be
inspired
by
your
achievement
for
generations
to
come
now
make
no
mistake
this
is
not
over
because
we
not
only
took
out
the
symbol
and
operational
leader
of
we
walked
off
with
his
files
the
largest
treasure
trove
of
intelligence
ever
seized
from
terrorist
leader
many
of
you
now
are
working
around
the
clock
you
have
much
time
to
celebrate
got
to
and
evaluate
and
exploit
this
mountain
of
intelligence
so
today
every
terrorist
in
the
network
should
be
watching
their
back
because
going
to
review
every
video
we
are
going
to
examine
every
photo
going
to
read
every
one
of
those
millions
of
pages
going
to
pursue
every
lead
we
are
going
to
go
wherever
it
takes
us
going
to
finish
the
job
we
are
going
to
defeat
even
as
we
stay
focused
on
this
mission
we
need
you
to
stay
nimble
and
flexible
to
meet
the
full
range
of
threats
to
our
security
from
plots
against
our
homeland
to
nations
seeking
weapons
of
mass
destruction
to
transnational
threats
such
as
criminals
and
so
going
to
keep
relying
on
you
for
your
intelligence
the
analysis
that
comes
across
my
desk
every
single
day
and
million
americans
are
counting
on
you
to
stay
step
ahead
of
our
adversaries
and
to
keep
our
country
safe
have
never
been
more
proud
or
more
confident
in
you
than
am
today
not
just
because
this
extraordinary
success
but
because
it
reminds
us
of
who
we
are
as
people
and
as
nation
you
reminded
us
that
when
we
americans
set
our
mind
to
something
when
we
are
focused
and
when
we
are
working
together
when
not
worried
about
getting
the
credit
and
when
we
stay
true
to
our
values
even
if
it
takes
years
there
is
nothing
we
can
not
do
why
still
believe
in
what
said
my
first
visit
here
two
years
ago
your
greatest
days
are
still
to
come
and
if
any
of
you
doubt
what
this
means
wish
could
have
taken
some
of
you
on
the
trip
made
to
new
york
city
where
we
laid
wreath
at
ground
zero
and
had
chance
to
meet
firefighters
who
had
lost
an
entire
shift
police
officers
who
had
lost
their
comrades
young
woman
years
old
who
had
written
to
me
because
her
last
memory
of
her
father
was
talking
to
him
on
the
phone
while
her
mother
wept
beside
her
right
before
they
watched
the
tower
go
down
and
she
and
other
members
of
families
of
victims
talked
about
what
this
meant
it
meant
that
their
suffering
had
not
been
forgotten
and
that
the
american
community
stands
with
them
that
we
stand
with
each
other
so
most
of
you
will
never
get
headlines
for
the
work
that
you
do
you
get
parades
but
as
you
go
about
your
work
with
incredible
diligence
and
dedication
every
single
day
hope
all
of
you
understand
how
important
it
is
how
grateful
am
and
that
you
have
the
thanks
of
grateful
nation
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
please
have
seat
thank
you
very
much
want
to
begin
by
thanking
who
has
so
much
these
last
six
months
that
she
is
approaching
new
landmark
one
million
frequent
flyer
miles
count
on
every
single
day
and
believe
that
she
will
go
down
as
one
of
the
finest
secretaries
of
state
in
our
history
the
state
department
is
fitting
venue
to
mark
new
chapter
in
american
diplomacy
for
six
months
we
have
witnessed
an
extraordinary
change
taking
place
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
square
by
square
town
by
town
country
by
country
the
people
have
risen
up
to
demand
their
basic
human
rights
two
leaders
have
stepped
aside
more
may
follow
and
though
these
countries
may
be
great
distance
from
our
shores
we
know
that
our
own
future
is
bound
to
this
region
by
the
forces
of
economics
and
security
by
history
and
by
faith
today
want
to
talk
about
this
change
the
forces
that
are
driving
it
and
how
we
can
respond
in
way
that
advances
our
values
and
strengthens
our
security
now
already
done
much
to
shift
our
foreign
policy
following
decade
defined
by
two
costly
conflicts
after
years
of
war
in
iraq
removed
american
troops
and
ended
our
combat
mission
there
in
broken
the
momentum
and
this
july
we
will
begin
to
bring
our
troops
home
and
continue
transition
to
afghan
lead
and
after
years
of
war
against
and
its
affiliates
we
have
dealt
huge
blow
by
killing
its
leader
bin
laden
bin
laden
was
no
martyr
he
was
mass
murderer
who
offered
message
of
hate
an
insistence
that
muslims
had
to
take
up
arms
against
the
west
and
that
violence
against
men
women
and
children
was
the
only
path
to
change
he
rejected
democracy
and
individual
rights
for
muslims
in
of
violent
extremism
his
agenda
focused
on
what
he
could
destroy
not
what
he
could
build
bin
laden
and
his
murderous
vision
won
some
adherents
but
even
before
his
death
was
losing
its
struggle
for
relevance
as
the
overwhelming
majority
of
people
saw
that
the
slaughter
of
innocents
did
not
answer
their
cries
for
better
life
by
the
time
we
found
bin
laden
agenda
had
come
to
be
seen
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
region
as
dead
end
and
the
people
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
had
taken
their
future
into
their
own
hands
that
story
of
began
six
months
ago
in
tunisia
on
december
young
vendor
named
was
devastated
when
police
officer
confiscated
his
cart
this
was
not
unique
the
same
kind
of
humiliation
that
takes
place
every
day
in
many
parts
of
the
world
the
relentless
tyranny
of
governments
that
deny
their
citizens
dignity
only
this
time
something
different
happened
after
local
officials
refused
to
hear
his
complaints
this
young
man
who
had
never
been
particularly
active
in
politics
went
to
the
headquarters
of
the
provincial
government
doused
himself
in
fuel
and
lit
himself
on
fire
there
are
times
in
the
course
of
history
when
the
actions
of
ordinary
citizens
spark
movements
for
change
because
they
speak
to
longing
for
freedom
that
has
been
building
up
for
years
in
america
think
of
the
defiance
of
those
patriots
in
boston
who
refused
to
pay
taxes
to
king
or
the
dignity
of
parks
as
she
sat
courageously
in
her
seat
so
it
was
in
tunisia
as
that
act
of
desperation
tapped
into
the
frustration
felt
throughout
the
country
hundreds
of
protesters
took
to
the
streets
then
thousands
and
in
the
face
of
batons
and
sometimes
bullets
they
refused
to
go
home
day
after
day
week
after
week
until
dictator
of
more
than
two
decades
finally
left
power
the
story
of
this
revolution
and
the
ones
that
followed
should
not
have
come
as
surprise
the
nations
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
won
their
independence
long
ago
but
in
too
many
places
their
people
did
not
in
too
many
countries
power
has
been
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
few
in
too
many
countries
citizen
like
that
young
vendor
had
nowhere
to
turn
no
honest
judiciary
to
hear
his
case
no
independent
media
to
give
him
voice
no
credible
political
party
to
represent
his
views
no
free
and
fair
election
where
he
could
choose
his
leader
and
this
lack
of
the
chance
to
make
your
life
what
you
will
has
applied
to
the
economy
as
well
yes
some
nations
are
blessed
with
wealth
in
oil
and
gas
and
that
has
led
to
pockets
of
prosperity
but
in
global
economy
based
on
knowledge
based
on
innovation
no
development
strategy
can
be
based
solely
upon
what
comes
out
of
the
ground
nor
can
people
reach
their
potential
when
you
can
not
start
business
without
paying
bribe
in
the
face
of
these
challenges
too
many
leaders
in
the
region
tried
to
direct
their
grievances
elsewhere
the
west
was
blamed
as
the
source
of
all
ills
after
the
end
of
colonialism
antagonism
toward
israel
became
the
only
acceptable
outlet
for
political
expression
divisions
of
tribe
ethnicity
and
religious
sect
were
manipulated
as
means
of
holding
on
to
power
or
taking
it
away
from
somebody
else
but
the
events
of
the
past
six
months
show
us
that
strategies
of
repression
and
strategies
of
diversion
will
not
work
anymore
satellite
television
and
the
internet
provide
window
into
the
wider
world
world
of
astonishing
progress
in
places
like
india
and
and
brazil
cell
phones
and
social
networks
allow
young
people
to
connect
and
like
never
before
and
so
new
generation
has
emerged
and
their
voices
tell
us
that
change
can
not
be
denied
in
cairo
we
heard
the
voice
of
the
young
mother
who
said
like
can
finally
breathe
fresh
air
for
the
first
in
we
heard
the
students
who
chanted
night
must
come
to
an
in
we
heard
the
engineer
who
said
words
are
free
now
feeling
you
in
damascus
we
heard
the
young
man
who
said
the
first
yelling
the
first
shout
you
feel
those
shouts
of
human
dignity
are
being
heard
across
the
region
and
through
the
moral
force
of
nonviolence
the
people
of
the
region
have
achieved
more
change
in
six
months
than
terrorists
have
accomplished
in
decades
of
course
change
of
this
magnitude
does
not
come
easily
in
our
day
and
age
time
of
news
cycles
and
constant
communication
people
expect
the
transformation
of
the
region
to
be
resolved
in
matter
of
weeks
but
it
will
be
years
before
this
story
reaches
its
end
along
the
way
there
will
be
good
days
and
there
will
bad
days
in
some
places
change
will
be
swift
in
others
gradual
and
as
already
seen
calls
for
change
may
give
way
in
some
cases
to
fierce
contests
for
power
the
question
before
us
is
what
role
america
will
play
as
this
story
unfolds
for
decades
the
united
states
has
pursued
set
of
core
interests
in
the
region
countering
terrorism
and
stopping
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
securing
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
the
security
of
the
region
standing
up
for
security
and
pursuing
peace
we
will
continue
to
do
these
things
with
the
firm
belief
that
interests
are
not
hostile
to
hopes
essential
to
them
we
believe
that
no
one
benefits
from
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
region
or
brutal
attacks
we
believe
people
everywhere
would
see
their
economies
crippled
by
in
energy
supplies
as
we
did
in
the
gulf
war
we
will
not
tolerate
aggression
across
borders
and
we
will
keep
our
commitments
to
friends
and
partners
yet
we
must
acknowledge
that
strategy
based
solely
upon
the
narrow
pursuit
of
these
interests
will
not
fill
an
empty
stomach
or
allow
someone
to
speak
their
mind
moreover
failure
to
speak
to
the
broader
aspirations
of
ordinary
people
will
only
feed
the
suspicion
that
has
festered
for
years
that
the
united
states
pursues
our
interests
at
their
expense
given
that
this
mistrust
runs
both
ways
as
americans
have
been
seared
by
and
violent
rhetoric
and
terrorist
attacks
that
have
killed
thousands
of
our
citizens
failure
to
change
our
approach
threatens
deepening
spiral
of
division
between
the
united
states
and
the
arab
world
and
why
two
years
ago
in
cairo
began
to
broaden
our
engagement
based
upon
mutual
interests
and
mutual
respect
believed
then
and
believe
now
that
we
have
stake
not
just
in
the
stability
of
nations
but
in
the
of
individuals
the
status
is
not
sustainable
societies
held
together
by
fear
and
repression
may
offer
the
illusion
of
stability
for
time
but
they
are
built
upon
fault
lines
that
will
eventually
tear
asunder
so
we
face
historic
opportunity
we
have
the
chance
to
show
that
america
values
the
dignity
of
the
street
vendor
in
tunisia
more
than
the
raw
power
of
the
dictator
there
must
be
no
doubt
that
the
united
states
of
america
welcomes
change
that
advances
and
opportunity
yes
there
will
be
perils
that
accompany
this
moment
of
promise
but
after
decades
of
accepting
the
world
as
it
is
in
the
region
we
have
chance
to
pursue
the
world
as
it
should
be
of
course
as
we
do
we
must
proceed
with
sense
of
humility
not
america
that
put
people
into
the
streets
of
or
cairo
it
was
the
people
themselves
who
launched
these
movements
and
the
people
themselves
that
must
ultimately
determine
their
outcome
not
every
country
will
follow
our
particular
form
of
representative
democracy
and
there
will
be
times
when
our
interests
align
perfectly
with
our
vision
for
the
region
but
we
can
and
we
will
speak
out
for
set
of
core
principles
principles
that
have
guided
our
response
to
the
events
over
the
past
six
months
the
united
states
opposes
the
use
of
violence
and
repression
against
the
people
of
the
region
the
united
states
supports
set
of
universal
rights
and
these
rights
include
free
the
freedom
of
peaceful
assembly
the
freedom
of
religion
equality
for
men
and
women
under
the
rule
of
law
and
the
right
to
choose
your
own
leaders
whether
you
live
in
baghdad
or
damascus
or
and
we
support
political
and
economic
reform
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
that
can
meet
the
legitimate
aspirations
of
ordinary
people
throughout
the
region
our
support
for
these
principles
is
not
secondary
interest
today
want
to
make
it
clear
that
it
is
top
priority
that
must
be
translated
into
concrete
actions
and
supported
by
all
of
the
diplomatic
economic
and
strategic
tools
at
our
disposal
let
me
be
specific
first
it
will
be
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
promote
reform
across
the
region
and
to
support
transitions
to
democracy
that
effort
begins
in
egypt
and
tunisia
where
the
stakes
are
high
as
tunisia
was
at
the
vanguard
of
this
democratic
wave
and
egypt
is
both
longstanding
partner
and
the
arab
largest
nation
both
nations
can
set
strong
example
through
free
and
fair
elections
vibrant
civil
society
accountable
and
effective
democratic
institutions
and
responsible
regional
leadership
but
our
support
must
also
extend
to
nations
where
transitions
have
yet
to
take
place
unfortunately
in
too
many
countries
calls
for
change
have
thus
far
been
answered
by
violence
the
most
extreme
example
is
libya
where
launched
war
against
his
own
people
promising
to
hunt
them
down
like
rats
as
said
when
the
united
states
joined
an
international
coalition
to
intervene
we
can
not
prevent
every
injustice
perpetrated
by
regime
against
its
people
and
we
have
learned
from
our
experience
in
iraq
just
how
costly
and
difficult
it
is
to
try
to
impose
regime
change
by
force
no
matter
how
it
may
be
but
in
libya
we
saw
the
prospect
of
imminent
massacre
we
had
mandate
for
action
and
heard
the
libyan
call
for
help
had
we
not
acted
along
with
our
nato
allies
and
regional
coalition
partners
thousands
would
have
been
killed
the
message
would
have
been
clear
keep
power
by
killing
as
many
people
as
it
takes
now
time
is
working
against
he
does
not
have
control
over
his
country
the
opposition
has
legitimate
and
credible
interim
council
and
when
inevitably
leaves
or
is
forced
from
power
decades
of
provocation
will
come
to
an
end
and
the
transition
to
democratic
libya
can
proceed
while
libya
has
faced
violence
on
the
greatest
scale
not
the
only
place
where
leaders
have
turned
to
repression
to
remain
in
power
most
recently
the
syrian
regime
has
chosen
the
path
of
murder
and
the
mass
arrests
of
its
citizens
the
united
states
has
condemned
these
actions
and
working
with
the
international
community
we
have
stepped
up
our
sanctions
on
the
syrian
regime
including
sanctions
announced
yesterday
on
president
and
those
around
him
the
syrian
people
have
shown
their
courage
in
demanding
transition
to
democracy
president
now
has
choice
he
can
lead
that
transition
or
get
out
of
the
way
the
syrian
government
must
stop
shooting
demonstrators
and
allow
peaceful
protests
it
must
release
political
prisoners
and
stop
unjust
arrests
it
must
allow
human
rights
monitors
to
have
access
to
cities
like
and
start
serious
dialogue
to
advance
democratic
transition
otherwise
president
and
his
regime
will
continue
to
be
challenged
from
within
and
will
continue
to
be
isolated
abroad
so
far
syria
has
followed
its
iranian
ally
seeking
assistance
from
in
the
tactics
of
suppression
and
this
speaks
to
the
hypocrisy
of
the
iranian
regime
which
says
it
stand
for
the
rights
of
protesters
abroad
yet
represses
its
own
people
at
home
remember
that
the
first
peaceful
protests
in
the
region
were
in
the
streets
of
where
the
government
women
and
men
and
threw
innocent
people
into
jail
we
still
hear
the
chants
echo
from
the
rooftops
of
the
image
of
young
woman
dying
in
the
streets
is
still
seared
in
our
memory
and
we
will
continue
to
insist
that
the
iranian
people
deserve
their
universal
rights
and
government
that
does
not
smother
their
aspirations
now
our
opposition
to
intolerance
and
repressive
measures
as
well
as
its
illicit
nuclear
program
and
its
support
of
terror
is
well
known
but
if
america
is
to
be
credible
we
must
acknowledge
that
at
times
our
friends
in
the
region
have
not
all
reacted
to
the
demands
for
consistent
change
with
change
consistent
with
the
principles
that
outlined
today
true
in
yemen
where
president
needs
to
follow
through
on
his
commitment
to
transfer
power
and
true
today
in
is
longstanding
partner
and
we
are
committed
to
its
security
we
that
iran
has
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
turmoil
there
and
that
the
government
has
legitimate
interest
in
the
rule
of
law
nevertheless
we
have
insisted
both
publicly
and
privately
that
mass
arrests
and
brute
force
are
at
odds
with
the
universal
rights
of
citizens
and
we
will
and
such
steps
will
not
make
legitimate
calls
for
reform
go
away
the
only
way
forward
is
for
the
government
and
opposition
to
engage
in
dialogue
and
you
have
real
dialogue
when
parts
of
the
peaceful
opposition
are
in
jail
the
government
must
create
the
conditions
for
dialogue
and
the
opposition
must
participate
to
forge
just
future
for
all
indeed
one
of
the
broader
lessons
to
be
drawn
from
this
period
is
that
sectarian
divides
need
not
lead
to
conflict
in
iraq
we
see
the
promise
of
democracy
the
iraqi
people
have
rejected
the
perils
of
political
violence
in
of
democratic
process
even
as
taken
full
responsibility
for
their
own
security
of
course
like
all
new
democracies
they
will
face
setbacks
but
iraq
is
poised
to
play
key
role
in
the
region
if
it
continues
its
peaceful
progress
and
as
they
do
we
will
be
proud
to
stand
with
them
as
steadfast
partner
so
in
the
months
ahead
america
must
use
all
our
influence
to
encourage
reform
in
the
region
even
as
we
acknowledge
that
each
country
is
different
we
need
to
speak
honestly
about
the
principles
that
we
believe
in
with
friend
and
foe
alike
our
message
is
simple
if
you
take
the
risks
that
reform
entails
you
will
have
the
full
support
of
the
united
states
we
must
also
build
on
our
efforts
to
broaden
our
engagement
beyond
elites
so
that
we
reach
the
people
who
will
shape
the
future
particularly
young
people
we
will
continue
to
make
good
on
the
commitments
that
made
in
cairo
to
build
networks
of
entrepreneurs
and
expand
exchanges
in
education
to
foster
cooperation
in
science
and
technology
and
combat
disease
across
the
region
we
intend
to
provide
assistance
to
civil
society
including
those
that
may
not
be
officially
sanctioned
and
who
speak
uncomfortable
truths
and
we
will
use
the
technology
to
connect
with
and
listen
to
the
voices
of
the
people
for
the
fact
is
real
reform
does
not
come
at
the
ballot
box
alone
through
our
efforts
we
must
support
those
basic
rights
to
speak
your
mind
and
access
information
we
will
support
open
access
to
the
internet
and
the
right
of
journalists
to
be
heard
whether
big
news
or
lone
in
the
century
information
is
power
the
truth
can
not
be
hidden
and
the
legitimacy
of
governments
will
ultimately
depend
on
active
and
informed
citizens
such
open
discourse
is
important
even
if
what
is
said
does
not
square
with
our
let
me
be
clear
america
respects
the
right
of
all
peaceful
and
voices
to
be
heard
even
if
we
disagree
with
them
and
sometimes
we
profoundly
disagree
with
them
we
look
forward
to
working
with
all
who
embrace
genuine
and
inclusive
democracy
what
we
will
oppose
is
an
attempt
by
any
group
to
restrict
the
rights
of
others
and
to
hold
power
through
coercion
and
not
consent
because
democracy
depends
not
only
on
elections
but
also
strong
and
accountable
institutions
and
the
respect
for
the
rights
of
minorities
such
tolerance
is
particularly
important
when
it
comes
to
religion
in
square
we
heard
from
all
walks
of
life
chant
we
are
america
will
work
to
see
that
this
spirit
prevails
that
all
faiths
are
respected
and
that
bridges
are
built
among
them
in
region
that
was
the
birthplace
of
three
world
religions
intolerance
can
lead
only
to
suffering
and
stagnation
and
for
this
season
of
change
to
succeed
must
have
the
right
to
worship
freely
in
cairo
just
as
must
never
have
their
mosques
destroyed
in
what
is
true
for
religious
minorities
is
also
true
when
it
comes
to
the
rights
of
women
history
shows
that
countries
are
more
prosperous
and
more
peaceful
when
women
are
empowered
and
why
we
will
continue
to
insist
that
universal
rights
apply
to
women
as
well
as
men
by
focusing
assistance
on
child
and
maternal
health
by
helping
women
to
teach
or
start
business
by
standing
up
for
the
right
of
women
to
have
their
voices
heard
and
to
run
for
office
the
region
will
never
reach
its
full
potential
when
more
than
half
of
its
population
is
prevented
from
achieving
their
full
potential
now
even
as
we
promote
political
reform
even
as
we
promote
human
rights
in
the
region
our
efforts
stop
there
so
the
second
way
that
we
must
support
positive
change
in
the
region
is
through
our
efforts
to
advance
economic
development
for
nations
that
are
to
democracy
after
all
politics
alone
has
not
put
protesters
into
the
streets
the
tipping
point
for
so
many
people
is
the
more
constant
concern
of
putting
food
on
the
table
and
providing
for
family
too
many
people
in
the
region
wake
up
with
few
expectations
other
than
making
it
through
the
day
perhaps
hoping
that
their
luck
will
change
throughout
the
region
many
young
people
have
solid
education
but
closed
economies
leave
them
unable
to
find
job
entrepreneurs
are
brimming
with
ideas
but
corruption
leaves
them
unable
to
profit
from
those
ideas
the
greatest
untapped
resource
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
is
the
talent
of
its
people
in
the
recent
protests
we
see
that
talent
on
display
as
people
harness
technology
to
move
the
world
no
coincidence
that
one
of
the
leaders
of
square
was
an
executive
for
that
energy
now
needs
to
be
in
country
after
country
so
that
economic
growth
can
solidify
the
accomplishments
of
the
street
for
just
as
democratic
revolutions
can
be
triggered
by
lack
of
individual
opportunity
successful
democratic
transitions
depend
upon
an
expansion
of
growth
and
prosperity
so
drawing
from
what
learned
around
the
world
we
think
important
to
focus
on
trade
not
just
aid
on
investment
not
just
assistance
the
goal
must
be
model
in
which
protectionism
gives
way
to
openness
the
reigns
of
commerce
pass
from
the
few
to
the
many
and
the
economy
generates
jobs
for
the
young
support
for
democracy
will
therefore
be
based
on
ensuring
financial
stability
promoting
reform
and
integrating
competitive
markets
with
each
other
and
the
global
economy
and
going
to
start
with
tunisia
and
egypt
first
asked
the
world
bank
and
the
international
monetary
fund
to
present
plan
at
next
summit
for
what
needs
to
be
done
to
and
the
economies
of
tunisia
and
egypt
together
we
must
help
them
recover
from
the
disruptions
of
their
democratic
upheaval
and
support
the
governments
that
will
be
elected
later
this
year
and
we
are
urging
other
countries
to
help
egypt
and
tunisia
meet
its
financial
needs
second
we
do
not
want
democratic
egypt
to
be
saddled
by
the
debts
of
its
past
so
we
will
relieve
democratic
egypt
of
up
to
billion
dollars
in
debt
and
work
with
our
egyptian
partners
to
invest
these
resources
to
foster
growth
and
entrepreneurship
we
will
help
egypt
regain
access
to
markets
by
guaranteeing
billion
in
borrowing
that
is
needed
to
finance
infrastructure
and
job
creation
and
we
will
help
newly
democratic
governments
recover
assets
that
were
stolen
third
working
with
congress
to
create
enterprise
funds
to
invest
in
tunisia
and
egypt
and
these
will
be
on
funds
that
supported
the
transitions
in
eastern
europe
after
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
will
soon
launch
billion
dollars
facility
to
support
private
investment
across
the
region
and
we
will
work
with
the
allies
to
refocus
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
so
that
it
provides
the
same
support
for
democratic
transitions
and
economic
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
as
it
has
in
europe
fourth
the
united
states
will
launch
comprehensive
trade
and
investment
partnership
initiative
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
if
you
take
out
oil
exports
this
entire
region
of
over
million
people
exports
roughly
the
same
amount
as
so
we
will
work
with
the
to
facilitate
more
trade
within
the
region
build
on
existing
agreements
to
promote
integration
with
and
european
markets
and
open
the
door
for
those
countries
who
adopt
high
standards
of
reform
and
trade
to
construct
regional
trade
arrangement
and
just
as
membership
served
as
an
incentive
for
reform
in
europe
so
should
the
vision
of
modern
and
prosperous
economy
create
powerful
force
for
reform
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
prosperity
also
requires
tearing
down
walls
that
stand
in
the
way
of
progress
the
corruption
of
elites
who
steal
from
their
people
the
red
tape
that
stops
an
idea
from
becoming
business
the
patronage
that
distributes
wealth
based
on
tribe
or
sect
we
will
help
governments
meet
international
obligations
and
invest
efforts
at
by
working
with
parliamentarians
who
are
developing
reforms
and
activists
who
use
technology
to
increase
transparency
and
hold
government
accountable
politics
and
human
rights
economic
reform
let
me
conclude
by
talking
about
another
cornerstone
of
our
approach
to
the
region
and
that
relates
to
the
pursuit
of
peace
for
decades
the
conflict
between
israelis
and
arabs
has
cast
shadow
over
the
region
for
israelis
it
has
meant
living
with
the
fear
that
their
children
could
be
blown
up
on
bus
or
by
rockets
fired
at
their
homes
as
well
as
the
pain
of
knowing
that
other
children
in
the
region
are
taught
to
hate
them
for
it
has
meant
suffering
the
humiliation
of
occupation
and
never
living
in
nation
of
their
own
moreover
this
conflict
has
come
with
larger
cost
to
the
middle
east
as
it
impedes
partnerships
that
could
bring
greater
security
and
prosperity
and
empowerment
to
ordinary
people
for
over
two
years
my
administration
has
worked
with
the
parties
and
the
international
community
to
end
this
conflict
building
on
decades
of
work
by
previous
administrations
yet
expectations
have
gone
unmet
israeli
settlement
activity
continues
have
walked
away
from
talks
the
world
looks
at
conflict
that
has
grinded
on
and
on
and
on
and
sees
nothing
but
stalemate
indeed
there
are
those
who
argue
that
with
all
the
change
and
uncertainty
in
the
region
it
is
simply
not
possible
to
move
forward
now
disagree
at
time
when
the
people
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
are
casting
off
the
burdens
of
the
past
the
drive
for
lasting
peace
that
ends
the
conflict
and
resolves
all
claims
is
more
urgent
than
ever
certainly
true
for
the
two
parties
involved
for
the
efforts
to
israel
will
end
in
failure
symbolic
actions
to
isolate
israel
at
the
united
nations
in
september
create
an
independent
state
leaders
will
not
achieve
peace
or
prosperity
if
insists
on
path
of
terror
and
rejection
and
will
never
their
independence
by
denying
the
right
of
israel
to
exist
as
for
israel
our
friendship
is
rooted
deeply
in
shared
history
and
shared
values
our
commitment
to
security
is
unshakeable
and
we
will
stand
against
attempts
to
single
it
out
for
criticism
in
international
forums
but
precisely
because
of
our
friendship
important
that
we
tell
the
truth
the
status
is
unsustainable
and
israel
too
must
act
boldly
to
advance
lasting
peace
the
fact
is
growing
number
of
live
west
of
the
river
technology
will
make
it
harder
for
israel
to
defend
itself
region
undergoing
profound
change
will
lead
to
populism
in
which
millions
of
people
not
just
one
or
two
leaders
must
believe
peace
is
possible
the
international
community
is
tired
of
an
endless
process
that
never
produces
an
outcome
the
dream
of
jewish
and
democratic
state
can
not
be
fulfilled
with
permanent
occupation
now
ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
israelis
and
to
take
action
no
peace
can
be
imposed
upon
them
not
by
the
united
states
not
by
anybody
else
but
endless
delay
make
the
problem
go
away
what
america
and
the
international
community
can
do
is
to
state
frankly
what
everyone
knows
lasting
peace
will
involve
two
states
for
two
peoples
israel
as
jewish
state
and
the
homeland
for
the
jewish
people
and
the
state
of
as
the
homeland
for
the
people
each
state
enjoying
mutual
recognition
and
peace
so
while
the
core
issues
of
the
conflict
must
be
negotiated
the
basis
of
those
negotiations
is
clear
viable
secure
israel
the
united
states
believes
that
negotiations
should
result
in
two
states
with
permanent
borders
with
israel
and
egypt
and
permanent
israeli
borders
with
we
believe
the
borders
of
israel
and
should
be
based
on
the
lines
with
mutually
agreed
swaps
so
that
secure
and
borders
are
established
for
both
states
the
people
must
have
the
right
to
govern
themselves
and
reach
their
full
potential
in
sovereign
and
contiguous
state
as
for
security
every
state
has
the
right
to
and
israel
must
be
able
to
defend
itself
by
itself
against
any
threat
provisions
must
also
be
robust
enough
to
prevent
resurgence
of
terrorism
to
stop
the
infiltration
of
weapons
and
to
provide
effective
border
security
the
full
and
phased
withdrawal
of
israeli
military
forces
should
be
coordinated
with
the
assumption
of
security
responsibility
in
sovereign
state
and
the
duration
of
this
transition
period
must
be
agreed
and
the
effectiveness
of
security
arrangements
must
be
demonstrated
these
principles
provide
foundation
for
negotiations
should
know
the
territorial
outlines
of
their
state
israelis
should
know
that
their
basic
security
concerns
will
be
met
aware
that
these
steps
alone
will
not
resolve
the
conflict
because
two
wrenching
and
emotional
issues
will
remain
the
future
of
and
the
fate
of
refugees
but
moving
forward
now
on
the
basis
of
territory
and
security
provides
foundation
to
resolve
those
two
issues
in
way
that
is
just
and
fair
and
that
respects
the
rights
and
aspirations
of
both
israelis
and
now
let
me
say
this
that
negotiations
need
to
begin
with
the
issues
of
territory
and
security
does
not
mean
that
it
will
be
easy
to
come
back
to
the
table
in
particular
the
recent
announcement
of
an
agreement
between
and
raises
profound
and
legitimate
questions
for
israel
how
can
one
negotiate
with
party
that
has
shown
itself
unwilling
to
your
right
to
exist
and
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
leaders
will
have
to
provide
credible
answer
to
that
question
meanwhile
the
united
states
our
quartet
partners
and
the
arab
states
will
need
to
continue
every
effort
to
get
beyond
the
current
impasse
how
hard
this
will
be
suspicion
and
hostility
has
been
passed
on
for
generations
and
at
times
it
has
hardened
but
convinced
that
the
majority
of
israelis
and
would
rather
look
to
the
future
than
be
trapped
in
the
past
we
see
that
spirit
in
the
israeli
father
whose
son
was
killed
by
who
helped
start
an
that
brought
together
israelis
and
who
had
lost
loved
ones
that
father
said
gradually
that
the
only
hope
for
progress
was
to
the
face
of
the
we
see
it
in
the
actions
of
who
lost
three
daughters
to
israeli
shells
in
have
the
right
to
feel
angry
he
said
many
people
were
expecting
me
to
hate
my
answer
to
them
is
shall
not
hate
let
us
hope
he
said
that
is
the
choice
that
must
be
made
not
simply
in
the
conflict
but
across
the
entire
region
choice
between
hate
and
hope
between
the
shackles
of
the
past
and
the
promise
of
the
future
choice
that
must
be
made
by
leaders
and
by
the
people
and
choice
that
will
define
the
future
of
region
that
served
as
the
cradle
of
and
crucible
of
strife
for
all
the
challenges
that
lie
ahead
we
see
many
reasons
to
be
hopeful
in
egypt
we
see
it
in
the
efforts
of
young
people
who
led
protests
in
syria
we
see
it
in
the
courage
of
those
who
brave
bullets
while
chanting
in
city
threatened
with
destruction
we
see
it
in
the
courthouse
square
where
people
gather
to
celebrate
the
freedoms
that
they
had
never
known
across
the
region
those
rights
that
we
take
for
granted
are
being
claimed
with
joy
by
those
who
are
prying
loose
the
grip
of
an
iron
fist
for
the
american
people
the
scenes
of
upheaval
in
the
region
may
be
unsettling
but
the
forces
driving
it
are
not
unfamiliar
our
own
nation
was
founded
through
rebellion
against
an
empire
our
people
fought
painful
civil
war
that
extended
freedom
and
dignity
to
those
who
were
enslaved
and
would
not
be
standing
here
today
unless
past
generations
turned
to
the
moral
force
of
nonviolence
as
way
to
perfect
our
union
marching
protesting
peacefully
together
to
make
real
those
words
that
declared
our
nation
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
those
words
must
guide
our
response
to
the
change
that
is
transforming
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
words
which
tell
us
that
repression
will
fail
and
that
tyrants
will
fall
and
that
every
man
and
woman
is
endowed
with
certain
inalienable
rights
it
will
not
be
easy
no
straight
line
to
progress
and
hardship
always
accompanies
season
of
hope
but
the
united
states
of
america
was
founded
on
the
belief
that
people
should
govern
themselves
and
now
we
can
not
hesitate
to
stand
squarely
on
the
side
of
those
who
are
reaching
for
their
rights
knowing
that
their
success
will
bring
about
world
that
is
more
peaceful
more
stable
and
more
just
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
hello
memphis
congratulations
to
the
class
of
now
will
admit
being
president
is
great
job
have
very
nice
plane
have
theme
song
but
what
enjoy
most
is
having
chance
to
come
to
school
like
washington
high
school
and
share
this
day
with
its
graduates
so
could
not
be
more
pleased
to
be
here
we
got
some
wonderful
guests
who
are
here
as
well
and
just
want
to
make
mention
of
them
very
quickly
first
of
all
the
governor
of
bill
is
here
please
give
him
big
round
of
applause
three
outstanding
members
of
the
congressional
delegation
all
of
whom
care
deeply
about
education
senator
bob
senator
and
congressman
is
here
you
got
one
of
memphis
own
former
congressman
ford
is
in
the
house
and
the
mayor
of
memphis
is
here
please
give
him
big
round
of
applause
am
so
proud
of
each
and
every
one
of
you
student
thank
you
the
president
you
welcome
you
made
it
and
not
just
through
high
school
you
made
it
past
principal
spent
little
bit
of
time
with
her
now
and
you
can
tell
she
is
not
messing
around
only
been
in
memphis
couple
of
hours
but
pretty
sure
that
if
she
told
me
to
do
something
do
it
then
had
the
chance
to
meet
her
mom
and
her
daughter
amber
little
while
back
and
we
took
picture
it
turns
out
amber
actually
goes
to
another
high
school
she
was
worried
that
the
boys
would
be
afraid
to
talk
to
her
if
her
mom
was
lurking
in
the
hallways
which
is
why
my
next
job
will
be
principal
at
and
high
school
and
then
be
president
of
their
college
let
me
also
say
to
and
heard
that
you
were
little
nervous
about
speaking
today
but
now
little
nervous
speaking
after
you
because
you
both
did
terrific
jobs
we
had
some
great
performances
by
and
and
and
the
jazz
band
give
them
big
round
of
applause
last
but
not
least
want
to
all
the
people
who
helped
you
to
reach
this
milestone
the
parents
the
grandparents
the
aunts
the
uncles
the
sisters
the
brothers
the
friends
the
who
have
loved
you
and
stood
behind
you
every
step
of
the
way
congratulations
family
and
want
to
acknowledge
the
devoted
teachers
and
administrators
at
washington
who
believed
in
you
who
kept
the
heat
on
you
and
have
never
treated
teaching
as
job
but
rather
as
calling
every
commencement
is
day
of
celebration
was
just
telling
somebody
backstage
just
love
get
all
choked
up
at
so
can
tell
you
already
right
now
will
cry
at
my
children
commencement
cry
at
other
people
but
this
one
is
especially
hopeful
this
one
is
especially
hopeful
because
some
people
say
that
schools
like
just
are
supposed
to
succeed
in
america
you
hear
them
say
the
streets
are
too
rough
in
those
the
schools
are
too
broken
the
kids
do
stand
chance
we
are
here
today
because
every
single
one
of
you
stood
tall
and
said
yes
we
can
yes
we
can
learn
yes
we
can
succeed
you
decided
you
would
not
be
defined
by
where
you
come
from
but
by
where
you
want
to
go
by
what
you
want
to
achieve
by
the
dreams
you
hope
to
just
couple
of
years
ago
this
was
school
where
only
about
half
the
students
made
it
to
graduation
for
long
time
just
handful
headed
to
college
each
year
but
at
washington
you
changed
all
that
you
created
special
academies
for
ninth
graders
to
start
students
off
on
the
right
track
you
made
it
possible
for
kids
to
take
classes
and
earn
college
credits
you
even
had
team
take
part
in
robotics
competition
so
students
can
learn
with
their
hands
by
building
and
creating
and
you
did
just
create
new
curriculum
you
created
new
culture
culture
that
prizes
hard
work
and
discipline
culture
that
shows
every
student
here
that
they
matter
and
that
their
teachers
believe
in
them
as
principal
says
the
kids
have
to
know
that
you
care
before
they
care
what
you
know
and
because
you
created
this
culture
of
caring
and
learning
today
we
standing
with
very
different
washington
high
school
today
this
is
place
where
more
than
four
out
of
five
students
are
earning
diploma
place
where
percent
of
the
graduates
will
continue
their
education
where
many
will
be
the
very
first
in
their
families
to
go
to
college
today
washington
is
place
that
has
proven
why
we
accept
excuses
any
excuses
when
it
comes
to
education
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
should
never
accept
anything
less
than
the
best
that
our
children
have
to
offer
as
your
teacher
where
at
there
he
is
big
mac
and
see
why
they
call
you
big
mac
as
said
in
the
local
paper
we
need
everyone
to
broaden
their
ideas
about
what
is
possible
we
need
parents
politicians
and
the
media
to
see
how
success
is
possible
how
success
is
happening
every
day
so
that
why
came
here
today
because
if
success
can
happen
here
at
washington
it
can
happen
anywhere
in
memphis
and
if
it
can
happen
in
memphis
it
can
happen
anywhere
in
and
it
can
happen
anywhere
in
it
can
happen
all
across
america
so
ever
since
became
president
my
administration
has
been
working
hard
to
make
sure
that
we
build
on
the
progress
that
taking
place
in
schools
like
this
we
got
to
encourage
the
kind
of
change
that
led
not
by
politicians
not
by
washington
but
by
teachers
and
principals
and
parents
and
entire
communities
by
ordinary
people
standing
up
and
demanding
better
future
for
their
children
we
have
more
work
to
do
so
that
every
child
can
his
or
her
potential
and
here
in
we
been
seeing
great
progress
has
been
leader
one
of
the
first
winners
of
the
nationwide
race
to
the
top
that
we
launched
to
reward
the
kind
of
results
you
getting
here
at
washington
and
understand
this
is
just
an
issue
for
me
standing
here
as
president
because
of
the
education
that
received
as
said
my
father
left
my
family
when
was
two
years
old
and
was
raised
by
single
mom
and
sometimes
she
struggled
to
provide
for
me
and
my
sister
but
my
mother
my
grandparents
they
pushed
me
to
excel
they
refused
to
let
me
make
excuses
and
they
kept
pushing
me
especially
on
those
rare
occasions
where
slack
off
or
get
into
trouble
they
were
that
rare
actually
sure
nobody
here
has
done
anything
like
that
so
blessed
that
they
kept
pushing
so
lucky
that
my
teachers
kept
pushing
because
education
made
all
the
difference
in
my
life
the
same
is
true
for
education
made
such
difference
in
her
life
dad
was
city
worker
had
multiple
sclerosis
had
to
wake
up
every
day
and
it
took
him
couple
hours
just
to
get
ready
for
work
but
he
went
to
work
every
day
her
mom
was
secretary
went
to
work
every
day
and
kept
on
pushing
her
just
like
my
folks
pushed
me
that
what
made
difference
in
our
lives
and
it
going
to
make
an
even
greater
difference
in
your
lives
not
just
for
your
own
success
but
for
the
success
of
the
united
states
of
america
because
we
live
in
new
world
now
used
to
be
that
you
did
have
to
have
an
education
if
you
were
willing
to
work
hard
you
could
go
to
factory
somewhere
and
get
job
those
times
are
passed
believe
it
or
not
when
you
go
out
there
looking
for
job
you
not
just
competing
against
people
in
or
atlanta
you
competing
against
young
people
in
beijing
and
that
some
tough
competition
those
kids
are
hungry
they
working
hard
and
you
need
to
be
prepared
for
it
and
as
country
we
need
all
of
our
young
people
to
be
ready
we
just
have
some
young
people
successful
we
got
to
have
every
young
person
contributing
earning
those
high
school
diplomas
and
then
earning
those
college
diplomas
or
getting
certified
in
trade
or
profession
we
succeed
without
it
through
education
you
can
also
better
yourselves
in
other
ways
you
learn
how
to
learn
how
to
think
critically
and
find
solutions
to
unexpected
challenges
remember
we
used
to
ask
our
teachers
why
am
going
to
need
algebra
well
you
may
not
have
to
solve
for
to
get
good
job
or
to
be
good
parent
but
you
will
need
to
think
through
tough
problems
you
need
to
think
on
your
feet
you
need
to
know
how
to
gather
facts
and
evaluate
information
so
math
teachers
you
can
tell
your
students
that
the
president
says
they
need
algebra
education
also
teaches
you
the
value
of
discipline
that
the
greatest
rewards
come
not
from
instant
gratification
but
from
sustained
effort
and
from
hard
work
this
is
lesson
that
especially
true
today
in
culture
that
prizes
flash
over
substance
that
tells
us
that
the
goal
in
life
is
to
be
entertained
that
says
you
can
be
famous
just
for
being
famous
you
get
on
reality
show
do
know
what
you
done
suddenly
you
famous
but
that
not
going
to
lead
to
lasting
sustained
achievement
and
finally
with
the
right
education
both
at
home
and
at
school
you
can
learn
how
to
be
better
human
being
for
when
you
read
great
story
or
you
learn
about
an
important
moment
in
history
it
helps
you
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
walk
in
somebody
else
shoes
to
know
their
struggles
the
success
of
our
economy
will
depend
on
your
skills
but
the
success
of
our
community
will
depend
on
your
ability
to
follow
the
golden
rule
to
treat
others
as
you
would
like
to
be
treated
we
seen
how
important
this
is
even
in
the
past
few
weeks
as
communities
here
in
memphis
and
all
across
the
south
have
come
together
to
deal
with
and
to
help
each
other
in
the
aftermath
of
terrible
all
of
these
qualities
empathy
discipline
the
capacity
to
solve
problems
the
capacity
to
think
critically
these
skills
do
just
change
how
the
world
sees
us
they
change
how
we
see
ourselves
they
allow
each
of
us
to
seek
out
new
horizons
and
new
opportunities
with
confidence
with
the
knowledge
that
we
ready
that
we
can
face
obstacles
and
challenges
and
unexpected
setbacks
that
the
power
of
your
education
that
the
power
of
the
diploma
that
you
receive
today
and
this
is
something
that
washington
himself
understood
think
about
it
he
entered
this
world
slave
on
southern
plantation
but
he
would
leave
this
world
as
the
leader
of
growing
civil
rights
movement
and
the
president
of
the
institute
washington
believed
that
change
and
equality
would
be
won
in
the
classroom
so
he
convinced
folks
to
help
him
buy
farmland
once
he
had
the
land
he
needed
school
so
he
assigned
his
first
students
to
actually
build
the
chairs
and
the
desks
and
even
couple
of
the
classrooms
you
thought
your
teachers
were
tough
washington
ran
tight
ship
he
ride
the
train
to
and
scare
some
of
the
new
students
this
is
before
and
so
the
kids
did
him
he
walk
up
to
them
and
say
oh
you
heading
to
heard
the
work
there
is
hard
heard
they
give
the
students
too
much
to
do
hear
the
food
is
terrible
you
probably
last
three
months
but
the
students
would
reply
they
were
afraid
of
hard
work
they
were
going
to
complete
their
studies
no
matter
what
washington
threw
at
them
and
in
that
way
he
prepared
them
because
life
will
throw
some
things
at
you
the
truth
is
not
single
one
of
the
graduates
here
today
has
had
it
easy
not
single
one
of
you
had
anything
handed
to
you
on
silver
platter
you
had
to
work
for
it
you
had
to
earn
it
most
of
all
you
had
to
believe
in
yourselves
think
of
stories
and
what
he
faced
in
his
life
lost
his
father
to
violence
at
the
age
of
four
had
childhood
illness
that
could
have
been
debilitating
but
somehow
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
could
take
different
path
think
of
all
the
graduates
here
who
had
to
leave
their
homes
when
their
apartments
were
torn
down
but
who
took
two
buses
each
morning
to
come
back
to
washington
think
of
where
is
has
known
lot
of
setbacks
in
her
young
life
there
was
period
when
she
lashed
out
and
she
got
into
trouble
and
she
made
mistakes
and
when
she
first
came
to
washington
she
struggled
is
that
right
there
are
plenty
of
people
out
there
who
would
have
counted
out
lot
of
people
who
would
have
thought
of
her
as
another
statistic
but
that
not
how
the
teachers
here
at
washington
saw
her
and
that
not
how
came
to
see
herself
so
she
kept
coming
back
to
school
and
she
did
give
up
and
she
did
quit
and
in
time
she
became
great
student
and
she
remembered
what
principal
told
her
you
let
the
past
get
you
down
you
have
to
let
it
motivate
you
and
so
now
here
is
graduating
she
going
to
keep
studying
to
get
her
barber
certificate
so
she
can
cut
hair
and
save
for
college
she
working
toward
her
dream
to
becoming
lawyer
she
got
bright
future
everybody
here
has
got
unique
story
like
that
to
tell
each
of
you
knows
what
it
took
for
you
to
get
here
but
in
reaching
this
milestone
there
is
common
lesson
shared
by
every
graduate
in
this
hall
and
said
it
himself
in
recent
interview
it
not
where
you
are
or
what
you
are
it
who
you
are
yes
you
from
south
memphis
yes
you
always
been
underdogs
nobody
has
handed
you
thing
but
that
also
means
that
whatever
you
accomplish
in
your
life
you
will
have
earned
it
whatever
rewards
and
joys
you
reap
you
appreciate
them
that
much
more
because
they
will
have
come
through
your
own
sweat
and
tears
products
of
your
own
effort
and
your
own
talents
you
shown
more
grit
and
determination
in
your
childhoods
than
lot
of
adults
ever
will
that
who
you
are
so
class
of
the
hard
road
does
not
end
here
your
journey
has
just
begun
your
diploma
is
not
free
pass
it
protect
you
against
every
setback
or
challenge
or
mistake
you
make
some
promise
you
going
to
have
to
keep
working
hard
you
going
to
have
to
keep
pushing
yourselves
and
you
find
yourselves
sometime
in
situations
where
folks
have
had
an
easier
time
they
little
bit
ahead
of
you
and
you
going
to
have
to
work
harder
than
they
are
and
you
may
be
frustrated
by
that
but
if
you
do
push
yourselves
if
you
build
on
what
you
already
accomplished
here
then
could
be
more
confident
about
your
futures
hopeful
and
excited
about
what
all
of
you
can
achieve
and
know
that
armed
with
the
skills
and
experience
and

love
that
you
gained

shake
some
hands

here
for
simple
reason
to
say
thank
you
on
behalf
of
america
this
has
been
an
historic
week
in
the
life
of
our
nation
thanks
to
the
incredible
skill
and
courage
of
countless
individuals
intelligence
military
over
many
years
the
terrorist
leader
who
struck
our
nation
on
will
never
threaten
america
again
yesterday
to
new
york
city
and
along
with
some
of
our
families
laid
wreath
at
ground
zero
in
memory
of
their
loved
ones
met
with
the
first
responders
the
firefighters
the
police
officers
the
port
authority
officers
who
lost
so
many
of
their
own
when
they
rushed
into
those
burning
towers
promised
that
our
nation
will
never
forget
those
we
lost
that
dark
september
day
and
today
here
at
fort
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
the
extraordinary
special
folks
who
that
promise
it
was
chance
for
me
to
say
on
behalf
of
all
americans
and
people
around
the
world
well
job
well
done
because
success
demands
secrecy
but
will
say
this
like
all
of
you
they
could
have
chosen
life
of
ease
but
like
you
they
volunteered
they
chose
to
serve
in
time
of
war
knowing
they
could
be
sent
into
way
they
trained
for
years
they
tirelessly
for
this
mission
and
when
gave
the
order
they
were
ready
now
in
recent
days
the
whole
world
has
learned
just
how
ready
they
were
these
americans
deserve
credit
for
one
of
the
greatest
intelligence
military
operations
in
our
history
but
so
does
every
person
who
wears
uniform
the
finest
military
the
world
has
ever
known
and
that
includes
all
of
you
men
and
women
of
you
have
been
on
the
of
this
fight
for
nearly
years
you
were
there
in
those
early
days
driving
the
from
power
pushing
out
of
its
safe
havens
over
time
as
the
insurgency
grew
you
went
back
for
in
some
cases
second
time
third
time
fourth
time
when
the
decision
was
made
to
go
into
iraq
you
were
there
too
making
the
longest
air
assault
in
history
defeating
vicious
insurgency
ultimately
giving
iraqis
the
chance
to
secure
their
democracy
and
been
at
the
forefront
of
our
new
strategy
in
sending
you
more
of
you
into
way
is
the
toughest
decision
that
made
as
make
it
lightly
every
time
visit
reed
every
time
visit
reminded
of
the
wages
of
war
but
made
that
decision
because
know
that
this
mission
was
vital
to
the
security
of
the
nation
that
we
all
love
and
know
it
been
easy
for
you
and
it
certainly
been
easy
for
your
families
since
no
base
has
deployed
more
often
and
few
bases
have
sacrificed
more
than
you
we
see
it
in
our
heroic
wounded
warriors
fighting
every
day
to
recover
and
who
deserve
the
absolute
best
care
in
the
world
we
see
it
in
the
mental
and
emotional
toll
been
taken
in
some
cases
some
good
people
good
soldiers
taken
their
own
lives
so
going
to
keep
saying
to
anybody
who
is
hurting
out
there
give
up
not
alone
your
country
needs
you
here
for
you
to
keep
you
strong
and
most
of
all
we
see
the
price
of
this
war
in
the
soldiers
from
fort
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
during
this
deployment
to
and
every
memorial
ceremony
every
is
solemn
reminder
of
the
heavy
burdens
of
war
but
also
the
values
of
loyalty
and
duty
and
that
have
defined
your
lives
so
what
each
of
you
must
know
because
of
your
service
because
of
your
sacrifices
making
progress
in
in
some
of
the
toughest
parts
of
the
country
general
and
the
are
taking
insurgents
and
their
leaders
off
the
battlefield
and
helping
afghans
reclaim
their
communities
across
broken
the
momentum
in
key
regions
seized
the
momentum
pushing
them
out
of
their
strongholds
building
the
capacity
of
afghans
partnering
with
communities
and
police
and
security
forces
which
are
growing
stronger
and
most
of
all
making
progress
in
our
major
goal
our
central
goal
in
pakistan
and
and
that
is
disrupting
and
dismantling
and
we
are
going
to
ultimately
defeat
we
have
cut
off
their
head
and
we
will
ultimately
defeat
them
even
before
this
operation
put
leadership
under
more
pressure
than
at
any
time
since
on
both
sides
of
the
border
so
the
bottom
line
is
this
our
strategy
is
working
and
no
greater
evidence
of
that
than
justice
finally
being
delivered
to
bin
laden
but
want
to
fool
you
this
continues
to
be
very
tough
fight
you
know
that
but
because
of
this
progress
moving
into
new
phase
in
the
coming
months
start
transferring
responsibility
for
security
to
afghan
forces
starting
this
summer
begin
reducing
american
forces
as
we
transition
build
partnership
with
the
afghan
people
so
that
can
never
again
threaten
america
from
that
country
and
as
your
confident
that
going
to
succeed
in
this
mission
the
reason
confident
is
because
in
you
see
the
strength
of
military
and
because
in
recent
days
all
seen
the
resilience
of
the
american
spirit
now
this
week
received
letter
from
girl
in
new
jersey
named
wall
she
wrote
to
me
on
monday
after
the
news
that
bin
laden
had
been
killed
and
she
explained
how
she
still
remembers
that
september
morning
almost
years
ago
she
was
only
four
years
old
her
father
glen
was
trapped
inside
the
world
trade
and
so
in
those
final
frantic
moments
knowing
he
might
not
make
it
he
called
home
and
remembers
watching
her
mom
sobbing
as
she
spoke
to
her
husband
and
then
passed
the
phone
to
and
in
words
that
were
hard
to
hear
but
which
never
forgotten
he
said
to
her
love
you
and
will
always
be
watching
over
so
yesterday
her
mom
and
her
sister
joined
me
at
ground
zero
and
now
is
these
past
years
have
been
tough
for
her
in
her
letter
she
said
since
my
father
died
lost
part
of
me
that
can
never
be
and
she
describes
her
childhood
as
girl
struggling
to
shine
through
all
the
darkness
in
her
but
every
year
more
and
more
is
shining
through
playing
lot
of
sports
including
lacrosse
and
track
just
like
her
dad
doing
well
in
school
younger
students
looking
ahead
to
high
school
in
the
fall
and
so
yesterday
she
was
with
us
strong
confident
young
woman
her
memory
even
as
she
set
her
sights
on
the
future
and
for
her
and
for
all
of
us
this
week
has
been
reminder
of
what
about
as
people
easy
to
forget
sometimes
especially
in
times
of
hardship
times
of
uncertainty
coming
out
of
the
worst
recession
since
the
great
depression
fully
recovered
from
that
made
enormous
sacrifices
in
two
wars
but
the
essence
of
america
the
values
that
have
defined
us
for
more
than
years
they
just
endure
they
are
stronger
than
ever
still
the
america
that
does
the
hard
things
that
does
the
great
things
the
nation
that
always
dared
to
dream
the
nation
willing
to
take
risks
revolutionaries
breaking
free
from
an
empire
pioneers
heading
west
to
settle
new
frontiers
innovators
building
railways
and
laying
the
highways
and
putting
man
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
we
are
the
nation
and
the
division
that
parachuted
behind
enemy
lines
on
freeing
continent
liberating
concentration
camps
the
nation
that
all
those
years
ago
sent
your
division
to
high
school
in
arkansas
so
that
nine
black
students
could
get
an
education
that
was
you
because
we
believed
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
everyone
deserves
chance
to
their
potential
the
nation
that
has
faced
tough
times
before
tougher
times
than
these
but
when
our
union
frayed
when
the
depression
came
when
our
was
bombed
when
our
country
was
attacked
on
that
september
day
when
disaster
strikes
like
that
tornado
that
just
ripped
through
this
region
we
do
not
falter
we
turn
back
we
pick
ourselves
up
and
we
get
on
with
the
hard
task
of
keeping
our
country
strong
and
safe
see
nothing
we
do
together
when
we
remember
who
we
are
at
that
is
the
united
states
of
america
when
we
remember
that
no
problem
is
too
hard
and
no
challenge
is
too
great
and
that
is
why
am
so
confident
that
with
your
brave
service
greatest
days
are
still
to
come
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
evening
tonight
can
report
to
the
american
people
and
to
the
world
that
the
united
states
has
conducted
an
operation
that
killed
bin
laden
the
leader
of
and
terrorist
responsible
for
the
murder
of
thousands
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
it
was
nearly
years
ago
that
bright
september
day
was
darkened
by
the
worst
attack
on
the
american
people
in
our
history
the
images
of
are
seared
into
our
national
memory
hijacked
planes
cutting
through
cloudless
september
sky
the
twin
towers
collapsing
to
the
ground
black
smoke
billowing
up
from
the
pentagon
the
wreckage
of
flight
in
where
the
actions
of
heroic
citizens
saved
even
more
heartbreak
and
destruction
and
yet
we
know
that
the
worst
images
are
those
that
were
unseen
to
the
world
the
empty
seat
at
the
dinner
table
children
who
were
forced
to
grow
up
without
their
mother
or
their
father
parents
who
would
never
know
the
feeling
of
their
embrace
nearly
citizens
taken
from
us
leaving
gaping
hole
in
our
hearts
on
september
in
our
time
of
grief
the
american
people
came
together
we
offered
our
hand
and
we
offered
the
wounded
our
blood
we
reaffirmed
our
ties
to
each
other
and
our
love
of
community
and
country
on
that
day
no
matter
where
we
came
from
what
god
we
prayed
to
or
what
race
or
ethnicity
we
were
we
were
united
as
one
american
family
we
were
also
united
in
our
resolve
to
protect
our
nation
and
to
bring
those
who
committed
this
vicious
attack
to
justice
we
quickly
learned
that
the
attacks
were
carried
out
by
an
headed
by
bin
laden
which
had
openly
declared
war
on
the
united
states
and
was
committed
to
killing
innocents
in
our
country
and
around
the
globe
and
so
we
went
to
war
against
to
protect
our
citizens
our
friends
and
our
allies
over
the
last
years
thanks
to
the
tireless
and
heroic
work
of
our
military
and
our
professionals
made
great
strides
in
that
effort
disrupted
terrorist
attacks
and
strengthened
our
homeland
in
we
removed
the
government
which
had
given
bin
laden
and
safe
haven
and
support
and
around
the
globe
we
worked
with
our
friends
and
allies
to
capture
or
kill
scores
of
terrorists
including
several
who
were
part
of
the
plot
yet
bin
laden
avoided
capture
and
escaped
across
the
afghan
border
into
pakistan
meanwhile
continued
to
operate
from
along
that
border
and
operate
through
its
affiliates
across
the
world
and
so
shortly
after
taking
office
directed
the
director
of
the
to
make
the
killing
or
capture
of
bin
laden
the
top
priority
of
our
war
against
even
as
we
continued
our
broader
efforts
to
disrupt
dismantle
and
defeat
his
network
then
last
august
after
years
of
painstaking
work
by
our
intelligence
community
was
briefed
on
possible
lead
to
bin
laden
it
was
far
from
certain
and
it
took
many
months
to
run
this
thread
to
ground
met
repeatedly
with
my
national
security
team
as
we
developed
more
information
about
the
possibility
that
we
had
located
bin
laden
hiding
within
compound
deep
inside
of
pakistan
and
finally
last
week
determined
that
we
had
enough
intelligence
to
take
action
and
an
operation
to
get
bin
laden
and
bring
him
to
justice
today
at
my
direction
the
united
states
launched
targeted
operation
against
that
compound
in
pakistan
small
team
of
americans
carried
out
the
operation
with
extraordinary
courage
and
capability
no
americans
were
harmed
they
took
care
to
avoid
civilian
casualties
after
firefight
they
killed
bin
laden
and
took
custody
of
his
body
for
over
two
decades
bin
laden
has
been
leader
and
symbol
and
has
continued
to
plot
attacks
against
our
country
and
our
friends
and
allies
the
death
of
bin
laden
marks
the
most
significant
achievement
to
date
in
our
effort
to
defeat
yet
his
death
does
not
mark
the
end
of
our
effort
no
doubt
that
will
continue
to
pursue
attacks
against
us
we
must
and
we
will
remain
vigilant
at
home
and
abroad
as
we
do
we
must
also
reaffirm
that
the
united
states
is
not
and
never
will
be
at
war
with
islam
made
clear
just
as
president
bush
did
shortly
after
that
our
war
is
not
against
islam
bin
laden
was
not
muslim
leader
he
was
mass
murderer
of
muslims
indeed
has
slaughtered
scores
of
muslims
in
many
countries
including
our
own
so
his
demise
should
be
welcomed
by
all
who
believe
in
peace
and
human
dignity
over
the
years
repeatedly
made
clear
that
we
would
take
action
within
pakistan
if
we
knew
where
bin
laden
was
that
is
what
done
but
important
to
note
that
our
cooperation
with
pakistan
helped
lead
us
to
bin
laden
and
the
compound
where
he
was
hiding
indeed
bin
laden
had
declared
war
against
pakistan
as
well
and
ordered
attacks
against
the
people
tonight
called
president
and
my
team
has
also
spoken
with
their
counterparts
they
agree
that
this
is
good
and
historic
day
for
both
of
our
nations
and
going
forward
it
is
essential
that
pakistan
continue
to
join
us
in
the
fight
against
and
its
affiliates
the
american
people
did
not
choose
this
fight
it
came
to
our
shores
and
started
with
the
senseless
slaughter
of
our
citizens
after
nearly
years
of
service
struggle
and
sacrifice
we
know
well
the
costs
of
war
these
efforts
weigh
on
me
every
time
as
have
to
sign
letter
to
family
that
has
lost
loved
one
or
look
into
the
eyes
of
service
member
been
gravely
wounded
so
americans
understand
the
costs
of
war
yet
as
country
we
will
never
tolerate
our
security
being
threatened
nor
stand
idly
by
when
our
people
have
been
killed
we
will
be
relentless
in
of
our
citizens
and
our
friends
and
allies
we
will
be
true
to
the
values
that
make
us
who
we
are
and
on
nights
like
this
one
we
can
say
to
those
families
who
have
lost
loved
ones
to
terror
justice
has
been
done
tonight
we
give
thanks
to
the
countless
intelligence
and
professionals
worked
tirelessly
to
achieve
this
outcome
the
american
people
do
not
see
their
work
nor
know
their
names
but
tonight
they
feel
the
satisfaction
of
their
work
and
the
result
of
their
pursuit
of
justice
we
give
thanks
for
the
men
who
carried
out
this
operation
for
they
exemplify
the
professionalism
patriotism
and
unparalleled
courage
of
those
who
serve
our
country
and
they
are
part
of
generation
that
has
borne
the
heaviest
share
of
the
burden
since
that
september
day
finally
let
me
say
to
the
families
who
lost
loved
ones
on
that
we
have
never
forgotten
your
loss
nor
wavered
in
our
commitment
to
see
that
we
do
whatever
it
takes
to
prevent
another
attack
on
our
shores
and
tonight
let
us
think
back
to
the
sense
of
unity
that
prevailed
on
know
that
it
has
at
times
frayed
yet
achievement
is
testament
to
the
greatness
of
our
country
and
the
determination
of
the
american
people
the
cause
of
securing
our
country
is
not
complete
but
tonight
we
are
once
again
reminded
that
america
can
do
whatever
we
set
our
mind
to
that
is
the
story
of
our
history
whether
the
pursuit
of
prosperity
for
our
people
or
the
struggle
for
equality
for
all
our
citizens
our
commitment
to
stand
up
for
our
values
abroad
and
our
sacrifices
to
make
the
world
safer
place
let
us
remember
that
we
can
do
these
things
not
just
because
of
wealth
or
power
but
because
of
who
we
are
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all
thank
you
may
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
all
right
everybody
please
have
seat
my
fellow
americans
it
is
wonderful
to
be
here
at
the
white
house
dinner
what
week
as
some
of
you
heard
the
state
of
hawaii
released
my
official
birth
certificate
hopefully
this
puts
all
doubts
to
rest
but
just
in
case
there
are
any
lingering
questions
tonight
prepared
to
go
step
further
tonight
for
the
first
time
am
releasing
my
official
birth
video
now
warn
you
no
one
has
seen
this
footage
in
years
not
even
me
but
take
look
oh
well
back
to
square

want
to
make

to
the
fox

is
fair

say
that
when

comes
to
my
presidency
the
honeymoon
is
over
for
example
some
people
now
suggest
that
too
professorial
and
like
to
address
that
by
assigning
all
of
you
some
reading
that
will
help
you
draw
your
own
conclusions
others
say
that
arrogant
but
found
really
great
tool
for
this
my
poll
numbers
even
let

my
key
core
constituency

serious
issue

laughter

here
though

could
really
hurt
mitt
heard
he
passed
universal
health
care
when
he
was
governor
of
someone
should
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
and
know
just
the
guy
to
do
it
trump
is
here
tonight
now
know
that
taken
some
flak
lately
but
no
one
is
happier
no
one
is
prouder
to
put
this
birth
certificate
matter
to
rest
than
the
and
because
he
can
finally
get
back
to
focusing
on
the
issues
that
matter
like
did
we
fake
the
moon
landing
what
really
happened
in
and
where
are
and
but
all
kidding
aside
obviously
we
all
know
about
your
credentials
and
breadth
of
experience
for
example
no
seriously
just
recently
in
an
episode
of
celebrity
apprentice
at
the
the
cooking
team
cooking
did
not
impress
the
judges
from
steaks
and
there
was
lot
of
blame
to
go
around
but
you
trump
that
the
real
problem
was
lack
of
leadership
and
so
ultimately
you
blame
or
you
fired
and
these
are
the
kind
of
decisions
that
would
keep
me
up
at
night
well
handled
sir
well
handled
say
what
you
will
about
trump
he
certainly
would
bring
some
change
to
the
white
house
see
what
got
up
there
so
yes
this
has
been
quite
year
in
politics
but
also
in
the
movies
many
people
for
instance
were
inspired
by
the
wonderful
film
well
some
of
you
may
not
know
this
but
there
now
sequel
in
the
works
that
touches
close
to
home
and
because
this
is
crowd
tonight
can
offer
sneak
peek
so
can
we
show
the
trailer
please
coming
to
near
you
let
me
close
on
serious
note
we
are
having
good
time
but
as
has
been
true
for
the
last
several
years
we
have
incredible
young
men
and
women
who
are
serving
in
uniform
overseas
in
the
most
extraordinary
of
circumstances
and
we
are
reminded
of
their
courage
and
their
we
also
need
to
remember
our
in
alabama
and
across
the
south
that
have
been
devastated
by
terrible
storms
from
last
week
and
were
down
there
yesterday
and
spent
lot
of
time
with
some
of
the
folks
who
have
been
affected
the
devastation
is
unimaginable
and
is
heartbreaking
and
going
to
be
long
road
back
and
so
we
need
to
keep
those
americans
in
our
thoughts
and
in
our
prayers
but
we
also
need
to
stand
with
them
in
the
hard
months
and
perhaps
years
to
come
intend
to
make
sure
that
the
federal
government
does
that
and
got
faith
that
the
journalists
in
this
room
will
do
their
part
for
the
people
who
have
been
affected
by
this
disaster
by
reporting
on
their
progress
and
letting
the
rest
of
america
know
when
they
will
need
more
help
those
are
stories
that
need
telling
and
what
all
of
you
do
best
whether
rushing
to
the
site
of
devastating
storm
in
alabama
or
braving
danger
to
cover
revolution
in
the
middle
east
you
know
in
the
last
months
seen
journalists
threatened
arrested
beaten
attacked
and
in
some
cases
even
killed
simply
for
doing
their
best
to
bring
us
the
story
to
give
people
voice
and
to
hold
leaders
accountable
and
through
it
all
seen
daring
men
and
women
risk
their
lives
for
the
simple
idea
that
no
one
should
be
silenced
and
everyone
deserves
to
know
the
truth
what
you
do
at
your
best
that
what
journalism
is
the
principle
that
you
uphold
it
is
always
important
but
especially
important
in
times
of
challenge
like
the
moment
that
america
and
the
world
is
facing
now
so
thank
you
for
your
service
and
the
contributions
that
you
make
and
want
to
close
by
not
only
your
service
but
also
to
remember
those
that
have
been
lost
as
consequence
of
the
extraordinary
reporting
that
done
over
recent
weeks
they
help
too
to
defend
our
freedoms
and
allow
democracy
to
flourish
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank

reaching
this
day

thank
you
for
allowing
me
the
profound
of
being
part
of
it
and
thank
you
for
my
first
honorary
associate
degree
one
of
the
perks
of
this
job
is
that
degrees
come
free
these
days
not
that
it
impresses
anybody
at
home
now
just
says
doctor
go
take
that
dog
for
it
is
such
thrill
to
be
at
one
of
the
largest
most
diverse
institutions
of
higher
learning
in
america
one
that
just
this
week
was
named
one
of
the
top
community
colleges
in
the
nation
more
than
students
study
across
your
eight
campuses
you
come
from
countries
represented
by
the
flags
that
just
marched
across
this
stage
you
speak
languages
about
percent
of
you
are
minorities
and
because
more
than
percent
of
you
find
job
in
your
field
of
study
fitting
that
your
motto
is
changes
as
someone
only
here
because
of
the
chances
my
education
gave
me
agree
more
opportunity
changes
everything
america
will
only
be
as
strong
in
this
new
century
as
the
opportunities
that
we
provide
you
the
opportunities
that
we
provide
to
all
our
young
people
latino
black
white
asian
native
american
everybody
america
will
only
be
as
strong
as
our
pursuit
of
scientific
research
and
our
leadership
in
technology
and
innovation
and
believe
that
community
colleges
like
this
one
are
critical
pathways
to
the
middle
class
that
equip
students
with
the
skills
and
the
education
necessary
to
compete
and
win
in
this
economy
and
why
made
community
colleges
of
my
education
agenda
along
with
helping
more
students
afford
college
be
prouder
of
the
work
done
in
community
colleges
and
your
accomplishment
today
is
vital
to
america
reclaiming
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
by
so
am
proud
of
you
am
proud
of
you
know
that
for
many
of
you
reaching
this
day
easy
audience
no
the
president
see
got
some
amens
there
perhaps
the
first
in
your
family
to
go
to
college
some
of
you
have
had
to
overcome
big
obstacles
defeat
your
own
doubts
prove
yourself
to
everyone
who
ever
believed
that
you
make
it
because
of
what
you
look
like
or
where
you
came
from
and
of
course
of
course
for
so
many
of
you
this
day
represents
the
of
your
dreams
when
you
were
born
this
is
their
achievement
as
well
so
give
it
up
for
your
parents
and
your
grandparents
your
cousins
and
your
uncles
and
your
aunties
this
is
their
day
too
this
is
their
day
too
see
the
diploma
about
to
receive
stands
for
something
more
than
the
investment
you
made
in
yourselves
the
result
of
an
investment
made
by
generations
before
you
an
investment
in
that
radical
yet
simple
idea
that
america
is
place
the
place
where
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
the
ideal
that
has
made
this
country
the
idea
represented
by
that
one
flag
that
all
of
you
cheered
for
what
has
made
us
shining
light
to
the
world
and
preserving
this
idea
keeping
the
american
dream
alive
from
one
generation
to
the
next
never
been
an
easy
task
an
even
greater
test
in
times
of
rapid
change
and
all
of
you
are
graduating
at
moment
when
change
is
coming
faster
than
ever
before
emerging
from
an
economic
downturn
like
we
seen
since
the
massive
shifts
in
technology
have
shifted
profoundly
what
our
economy
looks
like
massive
shifts
abroad
have
swift
and
dramatic
impacts
not
only
overseas
but
also
here
at
home
from
markets
on
wall
street
to
wallets
on
main
street
just
as
advances
in
technology
have
the
power
to
make
our
lives
better
they
also
force
us
to
compete
with
other
nations
like
never
before
tackling
big
challenges
like
terrorism
and
climate
change
require
sustained
national
effort
and
yet
too
often
our
politics
seems
as
broken
as
divided
as
ever
so
know
that
for
many
of
you
an
intimidating
time
to
be
marching
out
into
the
world
everything
seems
so
unsettled
the
future
may
seem
unclear
but
as
you
make
your
way
in
this
ever
changing
world
you
should
take
comfort
in
knowing
that
as
country
navigated
tougher
times
before
sailed
stormier
seas
earlier
today
spent
some
time
in
alabama
and
some
of
you
have
seen
what
happened
there
as
consequence
of
the
that
struck
the
mayor
and
visited
community
where
the
devastation
from
this
storm
was
simply
heartbreaking
entire
homes
and
blocks
just
gone
wiped
away
some
families
lost
everything
some
families
lost
family
but
what
was
striking
is
the
way
that
damaged
community
has
come
together
how
rallied
around
one
another
the
mayor
there
young
man
doing
wonderful
work
mayor
he
put
it
best
he
told
me
that
when
disasters
like
this
strike
all
our
grievances
seem
to
go
away
all
our
differences
seem
to
matter
all
our
political
disagreements
seem
so
petty
we
help
each
other
we
support
one
another
as
one
country
as
one
people
the
american
spirit
no
matter
how
hard
we
are
tested
we
look
to
our
faith
and
our
faith
in
one
another
no
matter
what
the
challenge
always
carried
the
american
dream
forward
been
true
throughout
our
history
when
bombs
fell
on
pearl
when
an
iron
curtain
fell
over
europe
when
the
threat
of
nuclear
war
loomed
just
miles
from
this
city
when
brilliant
september
morning
was
darkened
by
terror
in
none
of
those
instances
did
we
falter
we
endured
we
carried
the
dream
forward
gone
through
periods
of
great
economic
turmoil
from
an
economy
where
most
people
worked
on
farms
to
one
where
most
people
worked
in
factories
to
now
one
by
information
and
technology
through
it
all
persevered
adapted
prospered
workers
found
their
voice
and
the
right
to
for
fair
wages
and
safe
working
conditions
we
carried
forward
when
waves
of
irish
and
italian
immigrants
were
derided
as
criminals
and
outcasts
when
were
discriminated
against
or
jews
had
to
succumb
to
quotas
or
muslims
were
blamed
for
ills
when
blacks
were
treated
as
citizens
and
marriages
like
my
own
were
illegal
in
much
of
the
country
we
stop
we
accept
inequality
we
fought
we
overcame
we
carried
the
dream
forward
we
have
carried
this
dream
forward
through
times
when
our
politics
seemed
broken
this
is
not
the
first
time
where
it
looked
like
politicians
were
going
crazy
in
heated
debates
over
our
founding
some
warned
independence
would
doom
america
to
scene
of
bloody
discord
and
desolation
for
that
was
the
warning
about
independence
one
of
our
greatest
presidents
thomas
was
an
and
with
think
about
that
even
gotten
that
one
yet
lincoln
lincoln
they
were
both
vilified
in
their
own
times
as
tyrants
power
hungry
bent
on
destroying
democracy
and
of
course
this
state
has
seen
its
fair
share
of
tightly
contested
elections
and
made
it
through
those
moments
none
of
it
was
easy
lot
of
it
was
messy
sometimes
there
was
violence
sometimes
it
took
years
even
decades
for
us
to
find
our
way
through
but
the
thing
we
made
it
through
we
made
it
through
because
in
each
of
those
moments
we
made
choice
rather
than
turn
inward
and
wall
off
america
from
the
rest
of
the
world
chosen
to
stand
up
forcefully
for
the
ideals
and
the
rights
we
believe
are
universal
for
all
men
and
women
rather
than
settle
for
an
america
where
everybody
is
left
to
fend
for
themselves
where
we
think
only
about
our
own
needs
instead
of
the
country
that
leaving
to
our
children
we
have
chosen
to
build
nation
where
everybody
has
shot
at
opportunity
where
everyone
can
succeed
chosen
to
invest
in
our
people
and
in
their
future
building
public
schools
sending
generation
to
college
on
the
bill
laying
highways
and
building
ports
all
across
the
country
rather
than
turn
on
each
other
in
times
of
cultural
upheaval
chosen
to
march
to
to
to
turn
out
to
petition
our
government
for
rights
and
voting
rights
and
civil
rights
even
in
the
face
of
fierce
resistance
because
we
are
americans
and
no
matter
who
we
are
or
what
we
look
like
we
believe
that
in
this
country
all
are
equal
all
are
free
rather
than
give
in
to
the
voices
suggesting
we
set
our
sights
lower
downsize
our
dreams
or
settle
for
something
less
chosen
again
and
again
to
make
america
bigger
bolder
more
diverse
more
generous
more
hopeful
because
throughout
our
history
what
has
distinguished
us
from
all
other
nations
is
not
just
our
wealth
not
just
our
power
been
our
deep
commitment
to
individual
freedom
and
personal
responsibility
but
also
our
unshakeable
commitment
to
one
another
recognition
that
we
share
future
that
we
rise
or
fall
together
that
we
are
part
of
common
enterprise
that
is
greater
somehow
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
so
yes
class
of
change
will
be
constant
in
your
lives
and
that
can
be
scary
that
can
be
hard
and
sometimes
be
tempted
to
turn
inward
to
say
good
enough
for
me
is
good
sometimes
be
tempted
to
turn
on
one
another
to
say
problems
are
the
fault
of
those
who
look
like
me
or
sound
like
sometime
be
tempted
to
give
into
those
voices
that
warn
hard
try
you
but
have
faith
you
will
reject
those
voices
have
faith
you
will
reject
those
impulses
your
generation
was
born
into
world
with
fewer
walls
world
educated
in
an
era
of
information
tempered
by
war
and
economic
turmoil
and
as
our
globe
has
grown
smaller
and
more
connected
shed
the
heavy
weights
of
earlier
generations
your
generation
has
grown
up
more
accepting
and
tolerant
of
people
for
who
they
are
regardless
of
race
or
gender
or
religious
belief
regardless
of
creed
or
sexual
orientation
how
grown
up
you
see
our
diversity
as
strength
not
weakness
and
believe
those
life
experiences
have
fortified
you
as
earlier
generations
were
fortified
to
meet
the
tests
of
our
time
everything
have
seen
of
your
generation
has
shown
me
that
you
believe
as
deeply
as
any
previous
generation
that
america
can
always
change
for
the
better
class
of
you
and
your
generation
are
now
responsible
for
our
future
only
going
to
be
president
little
bit
longer
you
are
going
to
be
leaders
for
many
years
to
come
you
will
have
to
make
choices
to
keep
our
dream
alive
for
the
next
generation
choices
about
whether
stack
the
deck
against
workers
and
the
middle
class
or
whether
we
make
sure
america
remains
place
where
if
you
work
hard
you
can
get
ahead
going
to
have
to
make
choice
about
whether
say
we
afford
to
educate
our
young
people
and
send
them
to
college
or
whether
we
continue
to
be
country
that
makes
investments
that
are
necessary
to
keep
those
young
people
competitive
in
this
new
century
it
will
be
up
to
you
to
choose
whether
remain
vulnerable
to
swings
in
oil
prices
or
whether
we
invest
in
the
clean
energy
that
can
break
our
dependence
on
oil
and
protect
our
planet
it
will
be
your
choice
as
to
whether
we
break
our
promise
to
seniors
and
the
poor
and
the
disabled
and
tell
them
to
fend
for
themselves
or
whether
we
keep
strengthening
our
social
safety
net
and
our
health
care
system
and
it
will
be
up
to
you
whether
turn
on
one
another
or
whether
we
stay
true
to
our
values
of
fairness
and
opportunity
understanding
that
we
are
nation
of
immigrants
immigrants
that
built
this
country
into
an
economic
powerhouse
and
beacon
of
hope
around
the
world
know
this
last
issue
generates
some
passion
know
that
several
young
people
here
have
recently
identified
themselves
as
undocumented
some
were
brought
here
as
young
children
and
discovered
the
truth
only
as
adults
and
put
their
futures
on
the
line
in
hopes
it
will
spur
the
rest
of
us
to
live
up
to
our
most
cherished
values
strongly
believe
we
should
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
fix
it
so
that
it
meets
our
economic
and
security
needs
and
want
to
work
with
democrats
and
republicans
yes
to
protect
our
borders
and
enforce
our
laws
and
address
the
status
of
millions
of
undocumented
workers
and
will
keep
fighting
alongside
many
of
you
to
make
the
dream
act
the
law
of
the
land
like
all
of
this
movements
towards
justice
it
will
be
difficult
and
it
will
take
time
know
some
here
wish
that
could
just
bypass
congress
and
change
the
law
myself
but
not
how
democracy
works
see
democracy
is
hard
but
right
changing
our
laws
means
doing
the
hard
work
of
changing
minds
and
changing
votes
one
by
one
and
am
convinced
we
can
change
the
laws
because
we
should
all
be
able
to
agree
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
expel
talented
young
people
from
our
country
they
grew
up
as
americans
they
pledge
allegiance
to
our
flag
and
if
they
are
trying
to
serve
in
our
military
or
earn
degree
they
are
contributing
to
our
future
and
we
welcome
those
contributions
we
raise
the
statue
of
liberty
with
its
back
to
the
world
we
raised
it
with
its
light
to
the
world
whether
your
ancestors
came
here
on
the
mayflower
or
slave
ship
whether
they
signed
in
at
island
or
they
crossed
the
we
are
one
people
we
need
one
another
our
patriotism
is
not
rooted
in
ethnicity
but
in
shared
belief
of
the
enduring
and
permanent
promise
of
this
country
the
promise
redeemed
by
your
graduation
today
the
promise
that
drew
so
many
of
you
to
this
college
and
your
parents
to
this
country
and
the
promise
that
drew
my
own
father
here
know
him
well
my
father
and
he
lived
troubled
life
but
know
that
when
he
was
around
your
age
he
dreamed
of
something
more
than
his
lot
in
life
he
dreamed
of
that
magical
place
he
dreamed
of
coming
to
study
in
america
and
when
was
around
your
age
back
to
his
home
country
of
kenya
for
the
first
time
to
learn
his
story
and
went
to
tiny
village
called
where
his
stepmother
still
lives
in
the
house
where
he
grew
up
and
visited
his
grave
and
asked
her
if
there
was
anything
left
for
me
to
know
him
by
and
she
opened
trunk
and
she
took
out
stack
of
letters
and
this
is
an
elderly
woman
who
read
or
write
but
she
had
saved
these
letters
more
than
of
them
written
in
his
hand
and
addressed
to
colleges
and
universities
all
across
america
they
that
different
from
the
letters
that
wrote
when
was
trying
to
get
into
college
or
the
ones
that
you
wrote
when
you
were
hoping
to
come
here
they
were
written
in
the
simple
sometimes
awkward
sometimes
grammatically
incorrect
unmistakably
hopeful
voice
of
somebody
who
is
just
desperate
for
chance
just
desperate
to
live
his
unlikely
dream
and
somebody
at
the
university
of
hawaii
halfway
around
the
world
chose
to
give
him
that
chance
and
because
that
person
gave
young
man
chance
he
met
young
woman
from
they
had
son
in
the
land
where
all
things
are
possible
and
one
of
my
earliest
memories
from
growing
up
in
hawaii
is
of
sitting
on
my
shoulders
to
see
the
astronauts
from
one
of
the
apollo
space
missions
come
ashore
after
successful
splashdown
you
remember
that
no
matter
how
young
you
are
as
child
one
of
those
unforgettable
moments
when
you
first
the
miracle
that
is
what
this
country
is
capable
of
and
remember
waving
little
american
flag
on
top
of
my
shoulders
thinking
about
those
astronauts
and
thinking
about
space
and
today
on
this
day
more
than
years
later
took
my
daughters
to
the
kennedy
space
and
even
though
we
get
to
see
the
space
shuttle
endeavour
launch
we
met
some
of
the
astronauts
and
we
toured
the
space
shuttle
atlantis
and
looking
at
my
daughters
thought
of
how
things
come
full
circle
thought
of
all
that
achieved
as
nation
since
was
their
age
little
brown
boy
sitting
on
my
shoulders
and
thought
about
all
want
us
to
achieve
by
the
time
they
have
children
of
their
own
my
proof
that
the
idea
of
america
endures
my
evidence
that
our
brave
on
this
earth
continues
and
every
single
day
walk
into
the
oval
office
and
for
all
the
days
of
my
life
will
always
remember
that
in
no
other
nation
on
earth
could
my
story
be
possible
could
your
stories
be
possible
that
is
something
celebrate
that
is
something
that
drives
every
decision
make
so
what
ask
of
you
graduates
as
you
walk
out
of
here
today
is
this
pursue
success
do
not
falter
when
you
make
it
pull
somebody
else
up
preserve
our
dream
remember
your
life
is
richer
when
people
around
you
have
shot
at
opportunity
as
well
strive
to
widen
that
circle
of
possibility
strive
to
forge
that
big
generous
optimistic
vision
of
america
that
we
inherited
strive
to
carry
that
dream
forward
to
future
generations
thank
you
congratulations
may
god
bless
you
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
well
and
want
to
express
first
of
all
our
deepest
condolences
to
not
just
the
city
of
but
the
state
of
alabama
and
all
the
other
states
that
have
been
affected
by
this
unbelievable
storm
we
just
took
tour
and
got
to
say
never
seen
devastation
like
this
it
is
heartbreaking
we
were
just
talking
to
some
residents
here
who
were
lucky
enough
to
escape
alive
but
have
lost
everything
they
mentioned
that
their
had
lost
two
of
their
grandchildren
in
the
process
what
seeing
here
is
the
consequence
of
just
few
minutes
of
this
extraordinarily
powerful
storm
sweeping
through
this
community
and
as
the
governor
was
mentioning
typically
gets
tornado
during
the
season
but
this
is
something
that
think
anybody
has
seen
before
in
addition
to
keeping
all
the
families
been
affected
in
our
thoughts
and
prayers
obviously
our
biggest
priority
now
is
to
help
this
community
recover
want
to
thank
mayor
for
his
extraordinary
leadership
chief
know
is
having
to
dealing
with
lot
of
difficulties
one
of
the
challenges
that
the
mayor
was
explaining
is
is
that
the
assets
of
the
city
fire
station
that
we
passed
on
the
way
in
police
resources
emergency
resources
those
too
have
been
affected
fortunately
the
governor
has
done
an
extraordinary
job
with
his
team
in
making
sure
that
the
resources
of
the
state
are
and
have
been
brought
in
here
very
pleased
that
got
director
in
who
is
as
experienced
as
anybody
in
responding
to
disasters
even
of
this
magnitude
and
already
provided
the
disaster
designations
already
provided
the
disaster
designations
that
are
required
to
make
sure
that
the
maximum
federal
help
comes
here
as
quickly
as
possible
is
working
with
the
teams
on
the
ground
to
make
sure
that
we
are
seamlessly
coordinating
between
the
state
local
and
federal
governments
and
want
to
just
make
commitment
to
the
communities
here
that
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
help
these
communities
rebuild
we
bring
those
who
have
been
lost
back
alongside
god
at
this
point
we
can
help
maybe
little
bit
with
the
families
dealing
with
the
grief
of
having
loved
one
lost
but
the
property
damage
which
is
obviously
extensive
that
something
that
we
can
do
something
about
and
so
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
partner
with
you
mayor
with
you
governor
as
the
governor
was
pointing
out
this
community
was
hit
as
bad
as
any
place
but
there
are
communities
all
across
alabama
and
all
across
this
region
that
have
been
affected
and
going
to
be
making
that
same
commitment
to
make
sure
that
doing
whatever
we
can
to
make
sure
that
people
are
okay
that
bee
likes
you
governor
wasp
the
president
okay
got
it
there
you
go
governor
no
he
got
him
away
you
get
him
mayor
the
secret
service
when
you
need
them
the
president
finally
let
me
just
say
this
as
you
walk
around
we
were
just
talking
to
three
young
people
over
there
college
students
here
at
the
university
of
alabama
who
are
volunteering
now
to
help
clean
up
one
of
the
young
ladies
there
she
actually
lived
in
this
apartment
here
at
the
time
the
storm
happened
what
struck
by
is
resilience
and
the
way
that
the
community
has
come
together
and
obviously
that
testimony
to
the
leadership
of
the
governor
and
the
mayor
but
also
inherent
as
part
of
the
american
spirit
we
go
through
hard
times
but
no
matter
how
hard
we
may
be
tested
we
maintain
our
faith
and
we
look
to
each
other
to
make
sure
that
supporting
each
other
and
helping
each
other
sure
that
that
spirit
is
going
to
continue
until
this
city
is
all
the
way
back
so
mayor
he
was
pointing
out
that
lot
of
national
media
down
here
now
and
the
mayor
expressed
the
concern
that
perhaps
the
media
will
move
on
in
day
or
week
or
month
and
that
folks
will
forget
happened
here
and
want
to
assure
him
that
the
american
people
all
across
the
country
are
with
him
and
his
community
and
going
to
make
sure
that
not
forgotten
and
that
we
do
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
that
we
rebuild
so
with
that
governor
would
you
like
to
say
few
words
governor
would
and
president
would
like
to
personally
thank
you
and
for
coming
and
visiting
alabama
because
you
know
as
you
fly
over
this
and
did
yesterday
as
you
fly
over
it
from
the
air
it
does
not
do
it
justice
until
here
on
the
ground
and
just
want
you
to
know
how
much
appreciate
that
we
asked
for
the
state
we
declared
state
of
emergency
early
on
even
before
the
first
hit
and
then
we
our
national
guard
the
first
day
we
then
asked
the
president
for
aid
and
we
asked
him
to
expedite
that
and
they
have
done
that
and
just
want
you
to
know
how
much
appreciate
that
president
because
all
these
people
appreciate
that
so
much
we
have
eight
counties
across
the
state
that
have
been
hit
by
major
this
probably
is
the
worst
one
but
we
have
others
as
you
go
across
the
state
you
see
the
same
evidence
of
all
across
the
state
and
so
there
are
people
that
are
hurting
we
have
now
confirmed
deaths
in
alabama
we
have
injured
we
have
number
of
people
missing
at
the
present
time
going
to
continue
to
work
in
mode
but
now
more
in
recovery
mode
thank
you
president
if
keep
him
off
of
me
the
president
going
to
keep
my
eye
on
you
looking
out
for
each
other
that
governor
yes
sir
yes
sir
but
am
let
me
say
am
so
proud
of
our
first
responders
in
this
state
they
have
done
an
outstanding
job
our
mayors
our
county
commissioners
our
police
our
firemen
they
have
all
just
done
fantastic
job
our
people
they
have
just
we
have
got
great
team
all
worked
together
and
now
we
have
the
federal
government
helping
us
and
you
know
that
just
shows
when
locals
and
state
and
federal
government
works
together
we
can
get
things
accomplished
and
that
what
going
to
do
and
so
president
welcome
to
alabama
but
not
under
these
circumstances
we
want
you
to
come
back
and
maybe
go
to
football
game
over
here
at
later
day
and
when
things
are
better
but
thank
you
for
your
help
the
president
will
gladly
come
back
governor
thank
you
sir
the
president
mayor
if
like
to
say
few
words
mayor
president
governor
thank
you
for
coming
today
the
last
hours
have
been
probably
the
most
trying
time
in
this
history
but
going
to
see
new
story
being
written
here
in
and
in
the
years
to
come
these
chapters
are
going
to
be
with
hope
and
opportunity
since
this
tragedy
began
been
using
romans
when
paul
wrote
under
persecution
in
our
confident
well
today
president
your
visit
here
has
brought
confident
hope
to
this
community
and
in
the
days
weeks
and
months
to
come
going
to
be
story
that
going
to
be
very
proud
of
and
you
can
talk
about
across
this
land
thank
you
again
for
coming
today
the
president
well
thank
you
for
your
leadership
and
two
last
points
want
to
make
first
of
all
got
our
congressional
delegation
here
and
am
absolutely
confident
that
they
will
make
sure
that
the
resources
are
available
to
help
rebuild
to
all
the
local
officials
who
are
here
know
that
been
personally
affected
but
know
that
going
to
provide
the
leadership
in
this
community
working
with
the
mayor
and
the
governor
to
do
what
is
needed
and
finally
think
the
mayor
said
something
very
profound
as
we
were
driving
over
here
he
said
what
amazing
is
when
something
like
this
happens
folks
forget
all
their
petty
differences
politics
differences
of
religion
or
race
all
that
fades
away
when
we
are
confronted
with
the
awesome
power
of
nature
and
reminded
that
all
we
have
is
each
other
and
so
hopefully
that
spirit
continues
and
grows
if
nothing
else
comes
out
of
this
tragedy
hope
that
that
one
of
the
things
that
comes
out
so
thank
you
very
much
everybody
now
let
me
just
comment
first
of
all
on
the
fact
that
get
the
networks
to
break
in
on
all
kinds
of
other
discussions
was
just
back
there
listening
to
chuck
he
was
saying
amazing
that
not
going
to
be
talking
about
national
security
would
not
have
the
networks
breaking
in
if
was
talking
about
that
chuck
and
you
know
it
as
many
of
you
have
been
briefed
we
provided
additional
information
today
about
the
site
of
my
birth
now
this
issue
has
been
going
on
for
two
two
and
half
years
now
think
it
started
during
the
campaign
and
have
to
say
that
over
the
last
two
and
half
years
have
watched
with
bemusement
been
puzzled
at
the
degree
to
which
this
thing
just
kept
on
going
we
had
every
official
in
hawaii
democrat
and
republican
every
news
outlet
that
has
investigated
this
confirm
that
yes
in
fact
was
born
in
hawaii
august
in
hospital
we
posted
the
certification
that
is
given
by
the
state
of
hawaii
on
the
internet
for
everybody
to
see
click
to
enlarge
people
have
provided
affidavits
that
they
in
fact
have
seen
this
birth
certificate
and
yet
this
thing
just
keeps
on
going
now
normally
would
not
comment
on
something
like
this
because
obviously
lot
of
stuff
swirling
in
the
press
on
at
any
given
day
and
got
other
things
to
do
but
two
weeks
ago
when
the
republican
house
had
put
forward
budget
that
will
have
huge
consequences
potentially
to
the
country
and
when
gave
about
my
budget
and
how
felt
that
we
needed
to
invest
in
education
and
infrastructure
and
making
sure
that
we
had
strong
safety
net
for
our
seniors
even
as
we
were
closing
the
deficit
during
that
entire
week
the
dominant
news
story
about
these
huge
monumental
choices
that
we
going
to
have
to
make
as
nation
it
was
about
my
birth
certificate
and
that
was
true
on
most
of
the
news
outlets
that
were
represented
here
and
so
just
want
to
make
larger
point
here
we
got
some
enormous
challenges
out
there
there
are
lot
of
folks
out
there
who
are
still
looking
for
work
everybody
is
still
suffering
under
high
gas
prices
we
going
to
have
to
make
series
of
very
difficult
decisions
about
how
we
invest
in
our
future
but
also
get
hold
of
our
deficit
and
our
debt
how
do
we
do
that
in
balanced
way
and
this
is
going
to
generate
huge
and
serious
debates
important
debates
and
there
are
going
to
be
some
fierce
disagreements
and
good
how
democracy
is
supposed
to
work
and
am
confident
that
the
american
people
and
political
leaders
can
come
together
in
bipartisan
way
and
solve
these
problems
we
always
have
but
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
if
we
are
distracted
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
if
we
spend
time
vilifying
each
other
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
if
we
just
make
stuff
up
and
pretend
that
facts
are
not
facts
not
going
to
be
able
to
solve
our
problems
if
we
get
distracted
by
sideshows
and
carnival
barkers
we
live
in
serious
time
right
now
and
we
have
the
potential
to
deal
with
the
issues
that
we
confront
in
way
that
will
make
our
kids
and
our
and
our
great
proud
and
have
every
confidence
that
america
in
the
century
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
out
on
top
just
like
we
always
have
but
going
to
have
to
get
serious
to
do
it
know
that
going
to
be
segment
of
people
for
which
no
matter
what
we
put
out
this
issue
will
not
be
put
to
rest
but
speaking
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
american
people
as
well
as
to
the
press
we
do
not
have
time
for
this
kind
of
silliness
got
better
stuff
to
do
got
better
stuff
to
do
got
big
problems
to
solve
and
confident
we
can
solve
them
but
going
to
have
to
focus
on
them
not
on
this
thanks
very
much
everybody
will
be
candidate
for
in
and
am
going
to
need
each
and
every
one
of
you
to
get
involved
and
know
that
lot
of
you
who
were
involved
in
the
campaign
earlier
over
the
last
two
years
you
probably
felt
some
frustration
there
have
been
times
where
you
wanted
washington
to
change
lot
more
quickly
than
it
has
and
it
keeps
on
slipping
into
those
same
old
bad
habits
but
want
everybody
here
to
remember
everything
we
accomplished
over
the
last
two
years
and
the
record
of
accomplishment
in
making
difference
for
ordinary
people
making
sure
that
they
can
get
the
health
care
that
they
need
making
sure
that
they
are
able
to
find
job
or
get
trained
for
job
for
the
future
all
those
things
are
happening
because
of
you
and
so
if
you
been
feeling
impatient
and
understand
that
if
if
you
feeling
frustrated
sometimes
that
should
be
reason
to
pull
back
that
reason
for
us
to
get
even
more
involved
because
we
know
if
we
done
this
much
over
the
last
two
years
imagine
what
we
can
do
over
the
next
six
as
long
as
we
keep
our
focus
on
the
future
as
long
as
we
keep
working
together
looking
forward
to
with
all
of
you
and
and
hope
you
are
too
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
at
want
you
to
know
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
worked
so
hard
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
keep
the
government
open
was
so
that
could
show
up
here
today
wanted
to
make
sure
that
all
of
you
had
one
more
excuse
to
skip
class
welcome
want
to
give
special
thanks
to
the
president
of
just
saw
him
where
is
he
there
he
is
right
there
we
got
lot
of
distinguished
guests
here
couple
of
people
want
to
acknowledge
first
of
all
my
outstanding
vice
president
is
here
our
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
in
the
house
jack
the
director
of
the
office
of
and
budget
gene
chair
of
the
national
economic
council
is
here
members
of
our
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
are
here
including
the
two
outstanding
chairs
and
are
here
and
we
have
number
of
members
of
congress
here
today
grateful
for
all
of
you
taking
the
time
to
attend
what
been
debating
here
in
washington
over
the
last
few
weeks
will
affect
the
lives
of
the
students
here
and
families
all
across
america
in
potentially
profound
ways
this
debate
over
budgets
and
deficits
is
about
more
than
just
numbers
on
page
about
more
than
just
cutting
and
spending
about
the
kind
of
future
that
we
want
about
the
kind
of
country
that
we
believe
in
and
what
want
to
spend
some
time
talking
about
today
from
our
first
days
as
nation
we
have
put
our
faith
in
free
markets
and
free
enterprise
as
the
engine
of
wealth
and
prosperity
more
than
citizens
of
any
other
country
we
are
rugged
individualists
people
with
healthy
of
too
much
government
but
always
been
another
thread
running
through
our
history
belief
that
all
connected
and
that
there
are
some
things
we
can
only
do
together
as
nation
we
believe
in
the
words
of
our
first
republican
president
abraham
lincoln
that
through
government
we
should
do
together
what
we
can
not
do
as
well
for
ourselves
and
so
built
strong
military
to
keep
us
secure
and
public
schools
and
universities
to
educate
our
citizens
laid
down
and
highways
to
facilitate
travel
and
commerce
supported
the
work
of
scientists
and
researchers
whose
discoveries
have
saved
lives
unleashed
repeated
technological
revolutions
and
led
to
countless
new
jobs
and
entire
new
industries
each
of
us
has
from
these
investments
and
more
prosperous
country
as
result
part
of
this
american
belief
that
all
connected
also
expresses
itself
in
conviction
that
each
one
of
us
deserves
some
basic
measure
of
security
and
dignity
we
that
no
matter
how
responsibly
we
live
our
lives
hard
times
or
bad
luck
crippling
illness
or
layoff
may
strike
any
one
of
us
but
for
the
grace
of
god
go
we
say
to
ourselves
and
so
we
contribute
to
programs
like
and
social
security
which
guarantee
us
health
care
and
measure
of
basic
income
after
lifetime
of
hard
work
unemployment
insurance
which
protects
us
against
unexpected
job
loss
and
which
provides
care
for
millions
of
seniors
in
nursing
homes
poor
children
those
with
disabilities
better
country
because
of
these
commitments
go
further
we
would
not
be
great
country
without
those
commitments
now
for
much
of
the
last
century
our
nation
found
way
to
afford
these
investments
and
priorities
with
the
taxes
paid
by
its
citizens
as
country
that
values
fairness
wealthier
individuals
have
traditionally
borne
greater
share
of
this
burden
than
the
middle
class
or
those
less
fortunate
everybody
pays
but
the
wealthier
have
borne
little
more
this
is
not
because
we
begrudge
those
done
well
we
rightly
celebrate
their
success
instead
basic
reflection
of
our
belief
that
those
benefited
most
from
our
way
of
life
can
afford
to
give
back
little
bit
more
moreover
this
belief
hindered
the
success
of
those
at
the
top
of
the
income
scale
they
continue
to
do
better
and
better
with
each
passing
year
now
at
certain
times
particularly
during
war
or
recession
our
nation
has
had
to
borrow
money
to
pay
for
some
of
our
priorities
and
as
most
families
understand
little
credit
card
debt
going
to
hurt
if
temporary
but
as
far
back
as
the
america
started
amassing
debt
at
more
alarming
levels
and
our
leaders
began
to
that
larger
challenge
was
on
the
horizon
they
knew
that
eventually
the
baby
boom
generation
would
retire
which
meant
much
bigger
portion
of
our
citizens
would
be
relying
on
programs
like
social
security
and
possibly
like
parents
with
young
children
who
know
they
have
to
start
saving
for
the
college
years
america
had
to
start
borrowing
less
and
saving
more
to
prepare
for
the
retirement
of
an
entire
generation
to
meet
this
challenge
our
leaders
came
together
three
times
during
the
to
reduce
our
deficit
three
times
they
forged
historic
agreements
that
required
tough
decisions
made
by
the
first
president
bush
then
made
by
president
by
democratic
congresses
and
by
republican
congress
all
three
agreements
asked
for
shared
responsibility
and
shared
sacrifice
but
they
largely
protected
the
middle
class
they
largely
protected
our
commitment
to
seniors
they
protected
our
key
investments
in
our
future
as
result
of
these
bipartisan
efforts
finances
were
in
great
shape
by
the
year
we
went
from
deficit
to
surplus
america
was
actually
on
track
to
becoming
completely
debt
free
and
we
were
prepared
for
the
retirement
of
the
baby
but
after
democrats
and
republicans
committed
to
fiscal
discipline
during
the
we
lost
our
way
in
the
decade
that
followed
we
increased
spending
dramatically
for
two
wars
and
an
expensive
prescription
drug
program
but
we
pay
for
any
of
this
new
spending
instead
we
made
the
problem
worse
with
trillions
of
dollars
in
tax
cuts
tax
cuts
that
went
to
every
millionaire
and
billionaire
in
the
country
tax
cuts
that
will
force
us
to
borrow
an
average
of
billion
every
year
over
the
next
decade
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
much
damage
this
caused
to
our
consider
this
in
the
last
decade
if
we
had
simply
found
way
to
pay
for
the
tax
cuts
and
the
prescription
drug
benefit
our
deficit
would
currently
be
at
low
historical
levels
in
the
coming
years
but
not
what
happened
and
so
by
the
time
took
office
we
once
again
found
ourselves
deeply
in
debt
and
unprepared
for
baby
boom
retirement
that
is
now
starting
to
take
place
when
took
office
our
projected
deficit
annually
was
more
than
trillion
on
top
of
that
we
faced
terrible
financial
crisis
and
recession
that
like
most
recessions
led
us
to
temporarily
borrow
even
more
in
this
case
we
took
series
of
emergency
steps
that
saved
millions
of
jobs
kept
credit
flowing
and
provided
working
families
extra
money
in
their
pocket
it
was
absolutely
the
right
thing
to
do
but
these
steps
were
expensive
and
added
to
our
deficits
in
the
short
term
so
how
our
fiscal
challenge
was
created
how
we
got
here
and
now
that
our
economic
recovery
is
gaining
strength
democrats
and
republicans
must
come
together
and
restore
the
fiscal
responsibility
that
served
us
so
well
in
the
we
have
to
live
within
our
means
we
have
to
reduce
our
deficit
and
we
have
to
get
back
on
path
that
will
allow
us
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
we
have
to
do
it
in
way
that
protects
the
recovery
protects
the
investments
we
need
to
grow
create
jobs
and
helps
us
win
the
future
now
before
get
into
how
we
can
achieve
this
goal
some
of
you
particularly
the
younger
people
here
you
do
qualify
laughter
some
of
you
might
be
wondering
is
this
so
important
why
does
this
matter
to
me
well
why
even
after
our
economy
recovers
our
government
will
still
be
on
track
to
spend
more
money
than
it
takes
in
throughout
this
decade
and
beyond
that
means
have
to
keep
borrowing
more
from
countries
like
china
that
means
more
of
your
tax
dollars
each
year
will
go
towards
paying
off
the
interest
on
all
the
loans
that
we
keep
taking
out
by
the
end
of
this
decade
the
interest
that
we
owe
on
our
debt
could
rise
to
nearly
trillion
think
about
that
that
the
interest
just
the
interest
payments
then
as
the
baby
start
to
retire
in
greater
numbers
and
health
care
costs
continue
to
rise
the
situation
will
get
even
worse
by
the
amount
of
taxes
we
currently
pay
will
only
be
enough
to
finance
our
health
care
programs
and
social
security
and
the
interest
we
owe
on
our
debt
it
every
other
national
priority
education
transportation
even
our
national
security
will
have
to
be
paid
for
with
borrowed
money
now
ultimately
all
this
rising
debt
will
cost
us
jobs
and
damage
our
economy
it
will
prevent
us
from
making
the
investments
we
need
to
win
the
future
we
be
able
to
afford
good
schools
new
research
or
the
repair
of
roads
all
the
things
that
create
new
jobs
and
businesses
here
in
america
businesses
will
be
less
likely
to
invest
and
open
shop
in
country
that
seems
unwilling
or
unable
to
balance
its
books
and
if
our
creditors
start
worrying
that
we
may
be
unable
to
pay
back
our
debts
that
could
drive
up
interest
rates
for
everybody
who
borrows
money
making
it
harder
for
businesses
to
expand
and
hire
or
families
to
take
out
mortgage
the
good
news
that
have
to
be
our
future
that
have
to
be
the
country
that
we
leave
our
children
we
can
solve
this
problem
we
came
together
as
democrats
and
republicans
to
meet
this
challenge
before
we
can
do
it
again
but
that
starts
by
being
honest
about
causing
our
deficit
you
see
most
americans
tend
to
dislike
government
spending
in
the
abstract
but
like
the
stuff
that
it
buys
most
of
us
regardless
of
party
affiliation
believe
that
we
should
have
strong
military
and
strong
most
americans
believe
we
should
invest
in
education
and
medical
research
most
americans
think
we
should
protect
commitments
like
social
security
and
and
without
even
looking
at
poll
my
finely
honed
political
instincts
tell
me
that
almost
nobody
believes
they
should
be
paying
higher
taxes
laughter
so
because
all
this
spending
is
popular
with
both
republicans
and
democrats
alike
and
because
nobody
wants
to
pay
higher
taxes
politicians
are
often
eager
to
feed
the
impression
that
solving
the
problem
is
just
matter
of
eliminating
waste
and
abuse
hear
that
phrase
lot
just
need
to
eliminate
waste
and
the
implication
is
that
tackling
the
deficit
issue
require
tough
choices
or
politicians
suggest
that
we
can
somehow
close
our
entire
deficit
by
eliminating
things
like
foreign
aid
even
though
foreign
aid
makes
up
about
percent
of
our
entire
federal
budget
so
the
truth
around
of
our
budget
is
spent
on
social
security
and
national
security
programs
like
unemployment
insurance
student
loans
benefits
and
tax
credits
for
working
families
take
up
another
percent
left
after
interest
on
the
debt
is
just
percent
for
everything
else
percent
for
all
of
our
national
priorities
education
clean
energy
medical
research
transportation
our
national
parks
food
safety
keeping
our
air
and
water
clean
you
name
it
all
of
that
accounts
for
percent
of
our
budget
now
up
till
now
the
debate
here
in
washington
the
cuts
proposed
by
lot
of
folks
in
washington
have
focused
exclusively
on
that
percent
but
cuts
to
that
percent
alone
solve
the
problem
so
any
serious
plan
to
tackle
our
deficit
will
require
us
to
put
everything
on
the
table
and
take
on
excess
spending
wherever
it
exists
in
the
budget
serious
plan
require
us
to
balance
our
budget
overnight
in
fact
economists
think
that
with
the
economy
just
starting
to
grow
again
we
need
approach
but
it
does
require
tough
decisions
and
support
from
our
leaders
in
both
parties
now
above
all
it
will
require
us
to
choose
vision
of
the
america
we
want
to
see
five
years
years
years
down
the
road
now
to
their
credit
one
vision
has
been
presented
and
championed
by
republicans
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
embraced
by
several
of
their
presidential
candidates
plan
that
aims
to
reduce
our
deficit
by
trillion
over
the
next
years
and
one
that
addresses
the
challenge
of
and
in
the
years
after
that
these
are
both
worthy
goals
worthy
goals
for
us
to
achieve
but
the
way
this
plan
achieves
those
goals
would
lead
to
fundamentally
different
america
than
the
one
known
certainly
in
my
lifetime
in
fact
think
it
would
be
fundamentally
different
than
what
known
throughout
our
history
percent
cut
in
clean
energy
percent
cut
in
education
percent
cut
in
transportation
cuts
in
college
grants
that
will
grow
to
more
than
per
year
the
proposal
these
the
kind
of
cuts
you
make
when
trying
to
get
rid
of
some
waste
or
find
extra
savings
in
the
budget
these
the
kinds
of
cuts
that
the
fiscal
commission
proposed
these
are
the
kinds
of
cuts
that
tell
us
we
afford
the
america
that
believe
in
and
think
you
believe
in
believe
it
paints
vision
of
our
future
that
is
deeply
pessimistic
vision
that
says
if
our
roads
crumble
and
our
bridges
collapse
we
afford
to
fix
them
if
there
are
bright
young
americans
who
have
the
drive
and
the
will
but
not
the
money
to
go
to
college
we
afford
to
send
them
go
to
china
and
see
businesses
opening
research
labs
and
solar
facilities
south
korean
children
are
outpacing
our
kids
in
math
and
science
scrambling
to
figure
out
how
they
put
more
money
into
education
brazil
is
investing
billions
in
new
infrastructure
and
can
run
half
their
cars
not
on
but
on
and
yet
we
are
presented
with
vision
that
says
the
american
people
the
united
states
of
america
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
afford
any
of
this
vision
that
says
america
afford
to
keep
the
promise
made
to
care
for
our
seniors
it
says
that
years
from
now
if
eligible
for
you
should
have
to
pay
nearly
more
than
you
would
today
it
says
instead
of
guaranteed
health
care
you
will
get
voucher
and
if
that
voucher
worth
enough
to
buy
the
insurance
available
in
the
open
marketplace
well
tough
luck
on
your
own
put
simply
it
ends
as
we
know
it
vision
that
says
up
to
million
americans
have
to
lose
their
health
insurance
in
order
for
us
to
reduce
the
deficit
who
are
these
million
americans
many
are
grandparents
may
be
one
of
yours
who
be
able
to
afford
nursing
home
care
without
many
are
poor
children
some
are
families
who
have
children
with
autism
or
syndrome
some
of
these
kids
with
disabilities
are
the
disabilities
are
so
severe
that
they
require
care
these
are
the
americans
be
telling
to
fend
for
themselves
and
worst
of
all
this
is
vision
that
says
even
though
americans
afford
to
invest
in
education
at
current
levels
or
clean
energy
even
though
we
afford
to
maintain
our
commitment
on
and
we
can
somehow
afford
more
than
trillion
in
new
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthy
think
about
that
in
the
last
decade
the
average
income
of
the
bottom
percent
of
all
working
americans
actually
declined
meanwhile
the
top
percent
saw
their
income
rise
by
an
average
of
more
than
quarter
of
million
dollars
each
who
needs
to
pay
less
taxes
they
want
to
give
people
like
me
tax
cut
paid
for
by
asking
seniors
each
to
pay
more
in
health
costs
not
right
and
not
going
to
happen
as
long
as
president
applause
this
vision
is
less
about
reducing
the
deficit
than
it
is
about
changing
the
basic
social
compact
in
america
own
budget
director
said
nothing
or
about
this
plan
nothing
serious
about
plan
that
claims
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
spending
trillion
dollars
on
tax
cuts
for
millionaires
and
billionaires
and
do
think
anything
courageous
about
asking
for
sacrifice
from
those
who
can
least
afford
it
and
have
any
clout
on
capitol
hill
that
not
vision
of
the
america
know
the
america
know
is
generous
and
compassionate
land
of
opportunity
and
optimism
yes
we
take
responsibility
for
ourselves
but
we
also
take
responsibility
for
each
other
for
the
country
we
want
and
the
future
that
we
share
nation
that
built
railroad
across
continent
and
brought
light
to
communities
shrouded
in
darkness
we
sent
generation
to
college
on
the
bill
and
we
saved
millions
of
seniors
from
poverty
with
social
security
and
we
have
led
the
world
in
scientific
research
and
technological
breakthroughs
that
have
transformed
millions
of
lives
who
we
are
this
is
the
america
that
know
we
have
to
choose
between
future
of
debt
and
one
where
we
forfeit
our
investment
in
our
people
and
our
country
to
meet
our
fiscal
challenge
we
will
need
to
make
reforms
we
will
all
need
to
make
sacrifices
but
we
do
not
have
to
sacrifice
the
america
we
believe
in
and
as
long
as
president
we
so
today
proposing
more
balanced
approach
to
achieve
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
over
years
an
approach
that
borrows
from
the
recommendations
of
the
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
that
appointed
last
year
and
it
builds
on
the
roughly
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
already
proposed
in
my
budget
an
approach
that
puts
every
kind
of
spending
on
the
table
but
one
that
protects
the
middle
class
our
promise
to
seniors
and
our
investments
in
the
future
the
first
step
in
our
approach
is
to
keep
annual
domestic
spending
low
by
building
on
the
savings
that
both
parties
agreed
to
last
week
that
step
alone
will
save
us
about
billion
over
years
we
will
make
the
tough
cuts
necessary
to
achieve
these
savings
including
in
programs
that
care
deeply
about
but
will
not
sacrifice
the
core
investments
that
we
need
to
grow
and
create
jobs
we
will
invest
in
medical
research
we
will
invest
in
clean
energy
technology
we
will
invest
in
new
roads
and
airports
and
broadband
access
we
will
invest
in
education
we
will
invest
in
job
training
we
will
do
what
we
need
to
do
to
compete
and
we
will
win
the
future
the
second
step
in
our
approach
is
to
find
additional
savings
in
our
budget
now
as
have
no
greater
responsibility
than
protecting
our
national
security
and
will
never
accept
cuts
that
compromise
our
ability
to
defend
our
homeland
or
interests
around
the
world
but
as
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
admiral
has
said
the
greatest
threat
to
national
security
is
debt
so
just
as
we
must
find
more
savings
in
domestic
programs
we
must
do
the
same
in
and
we
can
do
that
while
still
keeping
ourselves
safe
over
the
last
two
years
secretary
bob
gates
has
courageously
taken
on
wasteful
spending
saving
billion
in
current
and
future
spending
believe
we
can
do
that
again
we
need
to
not
only
eliminate
waste
and
improve
efficiency
and
effectiveness
but
going
to
have
to
conduct
fundamental
review
of
missions
capabilities
and
our
role
in
changing
world
intend
to
work
with
secretary
gates
and
the
joint
chiefs
on
this
review
and
will
make
specific
decisions
about
spending
after
complete
the
third
step
in
our
approach
is
to
further
reduce
health
care
spending
in
our
budget
now
here
the
difference
with
the
house
republican
plan
could
not
be
clearer
their
plan
essentially
lowers
the
health
care
bills
by
asking
seniors
and
poor
families
to
pay
them
instead
our
approach
lowers
the
health
care
bills
by
reducing
the
cost
of
health
care
itself
already
the
reforms
we
passed
in
the
health
care
law
will
reduce
our
deficit
by
trillion
my
approach
would
build
on
these
reforms
we
will
reduce
wasteful
subsidies
and
erroneous
payments
we
will
cut
spending
on
prescription
drugs
by
using
purchasing
power
to
drive
greater
efficiency
and
speed
generic
brands
of
medicine
onto
the
market
we
will
work
with
governors
of
both
parties
to
demand
more
efficiency
and
accountability
from
we
will
change
the
way
we
pay
for
health
care
not
by
the
procedure
or
the
number
of
days
spent
in
hospital
but
with
new
incentives
for
doctors
and
hospitals
to
prevent
injuries
and
improve
results
and
we
will
slow
the
growth
of
costs
by
strengthening
an
independent
commission
of
doctors
nurses
medical
experts
and
consumers
who
will
look
at
all
the
evidence
and
recommend
the
best
ways
to
reduce
unnecessary
spending
while
protecting
access
to
the
services
that
seniors
need
now
we
believe
the
reforms
proposed
to
strengthen
and
will
enable
us
to
keep
these
commitments
to
our
citizens
while
saving
us
billion
by
and
an
additional
trillion
in
the
decade
after
that
but
if
wrong
and
costs
rise
faster
than
we
expect
then
this
approach
will
give
the
independent
commission
the
authority
to
make
additional
savings
by
further
improving
but
let
me
be
absolutely
clear
will
preserve
these
health
care
programs
as
promise
we
make
to
each
other
in
this
society
will
not
allow
to
become
voucher
program
that
leaves
seniors
at
the
mercy
of
the
insurance
industry
with
shrinking
benefit
to
pay
for
rising
costs
will
not
tell
families
with
children
who
have
disabilities
that
they
have
to
fend
for
themselves
we
will
reform
these
programs
but
we
will
not
abandon
the
fundamental
commitment
this
country
has
kept
for
generations
that
includes
by
the
way
our
commitment
to
social
security
while
social
security
is
not
the
cause
of
our
deficit
it
faces
real
challenges
in
country
growing
older
as
said
in
the
state
of
the
union
both
parties
should
work
together
now
to
strengthen
social
security
for
future
generations
but
we
have
to
do
it
without
putting
at
risk
current
or
the
most
vulnerable
or
people
with
disabilities
without
slashing
benefits
for
future
generations
and
without
subjecting
guaranteed
retirement
income
to
the
whims
of
the
stock
market
and
it
can
be
done
the
fourth
step
in
our
approach
is
to
reduce
spending
in
the
tax
code
tax
expenditures
in
december
agreed
to
extend
the
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthiest
americans
because
it
was
the
only
way
could
prevent
tax
hike
on
americans
but
we
can
not
afford
trillion
worth
of
tax
cuts
for
every
millionaire
and
billionaire
in
our
society
we
afford
it
and
refuse
to
renew
them
again
beyond
that
the
tax
code
is
also
loaded
up
with
spending
on
things
like
deductions
and
while
agree
with
the
goals
of
many
of
these
deductions
from
to
charitable
giving
we
ignore
the
fact
that
they
provide
millionaires
an
average
tax
break
of
but
do
nothing
for
the
typical
family
that
so
my
budget
calls
for
limiting
deductions
for
the
wealthiest
percent
of
americans
reform
that
would
reduce
the
deficit
by
billion
over
years
but
to
reduce
the
deficit
believe
we
should
go
further
and
why
calling
on
congress
to
reform
our
individual
tax
code
so
that
it
is
fair
and
simple
so
that
the
amount
of
taxes
you
pay
determined
by
what
kind
of
accountant
you
can
afford
believe
reform
should
protect
the
middle
class
promote
economic
growth
and
build
on
the
fiscal
model
of
reducing
tax
expenditures
so
that
enough
savings
to
both
lower
rates
and
lower
the
deficit
and
as
called
for
in
the
state
of
the
union
we
should
reform
our
corporate
tax
code
as
well
to
make
our
businesses
and
our
economy
more
competitive
so
this
is
my
approach
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
trillion
over
the
next
years
an
approach
that
achieves
about
trillion
in
spending
cuts
across
the
budget
it
will
lower
our
interest
payments
on
the
debt
by
trillion
it
calls
for
tax
reform
to
cut
about
trillion
in
tax
expenditures
spending
in
the
tax
code
and
it
achieves
these
goals
while
protecting
the
middle
class
protecting
our
commitment
to
seniors
and
protecting
our
investments
in
the
future
now
in
the
coming
years
if
the
recovery
speeds
up
and
our
economy
grows
faster
than
our
current
projections
we
can
make
even
greater
progress
than
pledged
here
but
just
to
hold
washington
and
to
hold
me
accountable
and
make
sure
that
the
debt
burden
continues
to
decline
my
plan
includes
debt
if
by
our
debt
is
not
projected
to
fall
as
share
of
the
economy
if
we
hit
our
targets
if
congress
has
failed
to
act
then
my
plan
will
require
us
to
come
together
and
make
up
the
additional
savings
with
more
spending
cuts
and
more
spending
reductions
in
the
tax
code
that
should
be
an
incentive
for
us
to
act
boldly
now
instead
of
kicking
our
problems
further
down
the
road
so
this
is
our
vision
for
america
this
is
my
vision
for
america
vision
where
we
live
within
our
means
while
still
investing
in
our
future
where
everyone
makes
sacrifices
but
no
one
bears
all
the
burden
where
we
provide
basic
measure
of
security
for
our
citizens
and
we
provide
rising
opportunity
for
our
children
there
will
be
those
who
vigorously
disagree
with
my
approach
can
guarantee
that
as
well
laughter
some
will
argue
we
should
not
even
consider
ever
ever
raising
taxes
even
if
only
on
the
wealthiest
americans
just
an
article
of
faith
to
them
say
that
at
time
when
the
tax
burden
on
the
wealthy
is
at
its
lowest
level
in
half
century
the
most
fortunate
among
us
can
afford
to
pay
little
more
need
another
tax
cut
warren
need
another
tax
cut
not
if
we
have
to
pay
for
it
by
making
seniors
pay
more
for
or
by
cutting
kids
from
head
start
or
by
taking
away
college
scholarships
that
be
here
without
and
that
some
of
you
would
not
be
here
without
and
the
thing
believe
that
most
wealthy
americans
would
agree
with
me
they
want
to
give
back
to
their
country
country
done
so
much
for
them
just
washington
asked
them
to
others
will
say
that
we
even
talk
about
cutting
spending
until
the
economy
is
fully
recovered
these
are
mostly
folks
in
my
party
sympathetic
to
this
view
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
supported
the
payroll
tax
cuts
we
passed
in
december
also
why
we
have
to
use
scalpel
and
not
machete
to
reduce
the
deficit
so
that
we
can
keep
making
the
investments
that
create
jobs
but
doing
nothing
on
the
deficit
is
just
not
an
option
our
debt
has
grown
so
large
that
we
could
do
real
damage
to
the
economy
if
we
begin
process
now
to
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
finally
there
are
those
who
believe
we
make
any
reforms
to
or
social
security
out
of
fear
that
any
talk
of
change
to
these
programs
will
immediately
usher
in
the
sort
of
steps
that
the
house
republicans
have
proposed
and
understand
those
fears
but
guarantee
that
if
we
make
any
changes
at
all
we
be
able
to
keep
our
commitment
to
retiring
generation
that
will
live
longer
and
will
face
higher
health
care
costs
than
those
who
came
before
indeed
to
those
in
my
own
party
say
that
if
we
truly
believe
in
progressive
vision
of
our
society
we
have
an
obligation
to
prove
that
we
can
afford
our
commitments
if
we
believe
the
government
can
make
difference
in
lives
we
have
the
obligation
to
prove
that
it
works
by
making
government
smarter
and
leaner
and
more
effective
of
course
there
are
those
who
simply
say
no
way
we
can
come
together
at
all
and
agree
on
solution
to
this
challenge
say
the
politics
of
this
city
are
just
too
broken
the
choices
are
just
too
hard
the
parties
are
just
too
far
apart
and
after
few
years
on
this
job
have
some
sympathy
for
this
view
laughter
but
also
know
that
come
together
before
and
met
big
challenges
and
tip
came
together
to
save
social
security
for
future
generations
the
first
president
bush
and
democratic
congress
came
together
to
reduce
the
deficit
president
and
republican
congress
battled
each
other
ferociously
disagreed
on
just
about
everything
but
they
still
found
way
to
balance
the
budget
and
in
the
last
few
months
both
parties
have
come
together
to
pass
historic
tax
relief
and
spending
cuts
and
know
there
are
republicans
and
democrats
in
congress
who
want
to
see
balanced
approach
to
deficit
reduction
and
even
those
republicans
disagree
with
most
strongly
believe
are
sincere
about
wanting
to
do
right
by
their
country
we
may
disagree
on
our
visions
but
truly
believe
they
want
to
do
the
right
thing
so
believe
we
can
and
must
come
together
again
this
morning
met
with
democratic
and
republican
leaders
in
congress
to
discuss
the
approach
that
laid
out
today
and
in
early
may
the
vice
president
will
begin
regular
meetings
with
leaders
in
both
parties
with
the
aim
of
reaching
final
agreement
on
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
and
get
it
done
by
the
end
of
june
expect
the
details
in
any
final
agreement
to
look
exactly
like
the
approach
laid
out
today
this
democracy
not
how
things
work
eager
to
hear
other
ideas
from
all
ends
of
the
political
spectrum
and
though
sure
the
criticism
of
what
said
here
today
will
be
fierce
in
some
quarters
and
my
critique
of
the
house
republican
approach
has
been
strong
americans
deserve
and
will
demand
that
we
all
make
an
effort
to
bridge
our
differences
and
find
common
ground
this
larger
debate
that
having
this
larger
debate
about
the
size
and
the
role
of
government
it
has
been
with
us
since
our
founding
days
and
during
moments
of
great
challenge
and
change
like
the
one
that
living
through
now
the
debate
gets
sharper
and
it
gets
more
vigorous
not
bad
thing
in
fact
good
thing
as
country
that
prizes
both
our
individual
freedom
and
our
obligations
to
one
another
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
debates
that
we
can
have
but
no
matter
what
we
argue
no
matter
where
we
stand
always
held
certain
beliefs
as
americans
we
believe
that
in
order
to
preserve
our
own
freedoms
and
pursue
our
own
happiness
we
just
think
about
ourselves
we
have
to
think
about
the
country
that
made
these
liberties
possible
we
have
to
think
about
our
fellow
citizens
with
whom
we
share
community
and
we
have
to
think
about
required
to
preserve
the
american
dream
for
future
generations
this
sense
of
responsibility
to
each
other
and
to
our
country
this
partisan
feeling
it
democratic
or
republican
idea
patriotism
the
other
day
received
letter
from
man
in
florida
he
started
off
by
telling
me
he
vote
for
me
and
he
always
agreed
with
me
but
even
though
worried
about
our
economy
and
the
state
of
our
politics
what
he
said
he
said
still
believe
believe
in
that
great
country
that
my
grandfather
told
me
about
believe
that
somewhere
lost
in
this
quagmire
of
petty
bickering
on
every
news
station
the
is
still
need
to
use
our
dollars
here
rebuilding
refurbishing
and
restoring
all
that
our
ancestors
struggled
to
create
and
we
as
people
must
do
this
together
no
matter
the
of
the
state
one
comes
from
or
the
side
of
the
aisle
one
might
sit
still
still
believe
as
well
and
know
that
if
we
can
come
together
and
uphold
our
responsibilities
to
one
another
and
to
this
larger
enterprise
that
is
america
we
will
keep
the
dream
of
our
founding
alive
in
our
time
and
we
will
pass
it
on
to
our
children
we
will
pass
on
to
our
children
country
that
we
believe
in
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
at
we
got
number
of
acknowledgements
first
of
all
just
want
to
thank
president
for

most
importantly
the
students

the
had
tough
loss
coach
coach
is
here
too
and
love
coach
love
his
dad
and
the
great
tradition
that
had
and
it
turned
out
was
pretty
good
had
winning
that
game
in
my
bracket
so
all
hurting
here
but
that
what
next
year
is
for
we
meet
here
at
tumultuous
time
for
the
world
in
matter
of
months
seen
regimes
toppled
we
seen
democracy
take
root
in
north
africa
and
in
the
middle
east
witnessed
terrible
earthquake
catastrophic
tsunami
nuclear
emergency
that
has
battered
one
of
our
strongest
allies
and
closest
friends
in
the
economy
led
an
international
effort
in
libya
to
prevent
massacre
and
maintain
stability
throughout
the
broader
region
and
as
americans
heartbroken
by
the
lives
that
have
been
lost
as
result
of
these
events
deeply
moved
by
the
thirst
for
freedom
in
so
many
nations
and
moved
by
the
strength
and
the
perseverance
of
the
people
and
natural
think
to
feel
anxious
about
what
all
of
this
means
for
us
and
one
big
area
of
concern
has
been
the
cost
and
security
of
our
energy
obviously
the
situation
in
the
middle
east
implicates
our
energy
security
the
situation
in
japan
leads
us
to
ask
questions
about
our
energy
sources
in
an
economy
that
relies
so
heavily
on
oil
rising
prices
at
the
pump
affect
everybody
workers
farmers
truck
drivers
restaurant
owners
students
who
are
lucky
enough
to
have
car
businesses
see
rising
prices
at
the
pump
hurt
their
bottom
line
families
feel
the
pinch
when
they
fill
up
their
tank
and
for
americans
that
are
already
struggling
to
get
by
hike
in
gas
prices
really
makes
their
lives
that
much
harder
it
hurts
if
somebody
who
works
in
relatively
job
and
got
to
commute
to
work
it
takes
up
big
chunk
of
your
income
you
may
not
be
able
to
buy
as
many
groceries
you
may
have
to
cut
back
on
medicines
in
order
to
fill
up
the
gas
tank
so
this
is
something
that
everybody
is
affected
by
now
the
thing
we
have
been
down
this
road
before
remember
it
was
just
three
years
ago
that
gas
prices
topped
gallon
remember
because
was
in
the
middle
of
presidential
campaign
working
folks
certainly
remember
because
it
hit
lot
of
people
pretty
hard
and
because
we
were
at
the
height
of
political
season
you
had
all
kinds
of
slogans
and
gimmicks
and
outraged
politicians
they
were
waving
their
plans
for
gallon
gas
you
remember
that
baby
and
we
were
going
through
all
that
and
none
of
it
was
really
going
to
do
anything
to
solve
the
problem
there
was
lot
of
hue
and
cry
lot
of
fulminating
and
but
nothing
actually
happened
imagine
that
in
washington
the
truth
is
none
of
these
gimmicks
none
of
these
slogans
made
bit
of
difference
when
gas
prices
finally
did
fall
it
was
mostly
because
the
global
recession
had
led
to
less
demand
for
oil
companies
were
producing
less
the
demand
for
petroleum
went
down
prices
went
down
now
that
the
economy
is
recovering
demand
is
back
up
add
the
turmoil
in
the
middle
east
and
not
surprising
that
oil
prices
are
higher
and
every
time
the
price
of
barrel
of
oil
on
the
world
market
rises
by
gallon
of
gas
goes
up
by
about
cents
the
point
is
the
ups
and
downs
in
gas
prices
historically
have
tended
to
be
temporary
but
when
you
look
at
the
trends
there
are
going
to
be
more
ups
in
gas
prices
than
downs
in
gas
prices
and
because
got
countries
like
india
and
china
that
are
growing
at
rapid
clip
and
as
billion
more
people
start
consuming
more
goods
they
want
cars
just
like
got
cars
they
want
to
use
energy
to
make
their
lives
little
easier
just
like
got
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
demand
will
go
up
lot
faster
than
supply
just
fact
so
the
bottom
line
there
are
no
quick
fixes
anybody
who
tells
you
otherwise
telling
you
the
truth
and
we
will
keep
on
being
victim
to
shifts
in
the
oil
market
until
we
finally
get
serious
about
policy
for
secure
affordable
energy
future
going
to
have
to
think
long
term
which
is
why
came
here
to
talk
to
young
people
here
at
because
you
have
more
of
stake
in
us
getting
our
energy
policy
right
than
just
about
anybody
now
source
of
concern
though
known
about
the
dangers
of
our
oil
dependence
for
decades
nixon
talked
about
freeing
ourselves
from
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
every
president
since
that
time
has
talked
about
freeing
ourselves
from
dependence
on
foreign
oil
politicians
of
every
stripe
have
promised
energy
independence
but
that
promise
has
so
far
gone
unmet
talked
about
reducing
dependence
on
oil
when
was
running
for
president
and
proud
of
the
historic
progress
that
made
over
the
last
two
years
towards
that
goal
and
talk
about
that
little
bit
but
got
to
be
honest
run
into
the
same
political
gridlock
the
same
inertia
that
has
held
us
back
for
decades
that
has
to
change
that
has
to
change
we
can
not
keep
going
from
shock
when
gas
prices
go
up
to
trance
when
they
go
back
down
we
go
back
to
doing
the
same
things
been
doing
until
the
next
time
price
spike
and
then
shocked
again
we
rush
to
propose
action
when
gas
prices
are
high
and
then
hit
the
snooze
button
when
they
fall
again
we
keep
on
doing
that
the
united
states
of
america
can
not
afford
to
bet
our
prosperity
our
security
on
resource
that
will
eventually
run
out
and
even
before
it
runs
out
will
get
more
and
more
expensive
to
extract
from
the
ground
we
afford
it
when
the
costs
to
our
economy
our
country
and
our
planet
are
so
high
not
when
your
generation
needs
us
to
get
this
right
time
to
do
what
we
can
to
secure
our
energy
future
and
today
want
to
announce
new
goal
one
that
is
reasonable
one
that
is
achievable
and
one
that
is
necessary
when
was
elected
to
this
office
america
imported
million
barrels
of
oil
day
by
little
more
than
decade
from
now
we
will
have
cut
that
by
that
is
something
that
we
can
achieve
we
can
cut
our
oil
dependence
we
can
cut
our
oil
dependence
by
third
set
this
goal
knowing
that
still
going
to
have
to
import
some
oil
it
will
remain
an
important
part
of
our
energy
portfolio
for
quite
some
time
until
gotten
alternative
energy
strategies
fully
in
force
and
when
it
comes
to
the
oil
we
import
from
other
nations
obviously
got
to
look
at
like
canada
and
mexico
that
are
stable
and
steady
and
reliable
sources
we
also
have
to
look
at
other
countries
like
brazil
part
of
the
reason
went
down
there
is
to
talk
about
energy
with
the
they
recently
discovered
significant
new
oil
reserves
and
we
can
share
american
technology
and
with
them
as
they
develop
these
resources
but
our
best
opportunities
to
enhance
our
energy
security
can
be
found
in
our
own
backyard
because
we
boast
one
critical
renewable
resource
that
the
rest
of
the
world
match
american
ingenuity
american
ingenuity
american
to
make
ourselves
more
secure
to
control
our
energy
future
going
to
have
to
harness
all
of
that
ingenuity
task
we
be
finished
with
by
the
end
of
my
presidency
or
even
by
the
end
of
the
next
presidency
but
if
we
continue
the
work
that
already
begun
over
the
last
two
years
we
just
spark
new
jobs
industries
and
innovations
we
will
leave
your
generation
and
future
generations
with
country
that
is
safer
that
is
healthier
and
more
prosperous
so
today
my
administration
is
releasing
blueprint
for
secure
energy
future
that
outlines
comprehensive
national
energy
policy
one
that
been
pursuing
since
the
day
took
office
and
cutting
our
oil
dependence
by
third
is
part
of
that
plan
here
at
like
to
talk
in
broad
strokes
about
how
we
can
achieve
these
goals
now
meeting
the
goal
of
cutting
our
oil
dependence
depends
largely
on
two
things
first
finding
and
producing
more
oil
at
home
second
reducing
our
overall
dependence
on
oil
with
cleaner
alternative
fuels
and
greater
efficiency
this
begins
by
continuing
to
increase
oil
supply
even
for
those
of
you
who
are
interested
in
seeing
reduction
in
our
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
and
know
how
passionate
young
people
are
about
issues
like
climate
change
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
is
that
for
quite
some
time
america
is
going
to
be
still
dependent
on
oil
in
making
its
economy
work
now
last
year
american
oil
production
reached
its
highest
level
since
and
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
decade
oil
we
imported
accounted
for
less
than
half
of
the
liquid
fuel
we
consumed
so
that
was
good
trend
to
keep
reducing
that
reliance
on
imports
my
administration
is
encouraging
offshore
oil
exploration
and
production
as
long
as
safe
and
responsible
think
anybody
here
has
forgotten
what
happened
last
year
where
we
had
to
deal
with
the
largest
oil
spill
in
our
history
know
some
of
the
fishermen
down
in
the
gulf
coast
forgotten
it
and
what
we
learned
from
that
disaster
helped
us
put
in
place
smarter
standards
of
safety
and
responsibility
for
example
if
going
to
drill
in
got
to
prove
before
you
start
drilling
that
you
can
actually
contain
an
underwater
spill
just
common
sense
and
lately
been
hearing
folks
saying
well
the
administration
they
put
restrictions
on
how
oil
companies
operate
offshore
well
yes
because
we
just
spent
all
that
time
energy
and
money
trying
to
clean
up
big
mess
and
do
know
about
you
but
do
have
amnesia
remember
these
things
and
think
it
was
important
for
us
to
make
sure
that
we
prevent
something
like
that
from
happening
again
now
today
working
to
expedite
new
drilling
permits
for
companies
that
meet
these
higher
standards
since
they
were
put
in
approved
new
permits
approved
seven
permits
in
recent
weeks
when
it
comes
to
drilling
offshore
my
administration
approved
more
than
two
permits
last
year
for
every
new
well
that
the
industry
started
to
drill
so
any
claim
that
my
administration
is
responsible
for
gas
prices
because
oil
production
any
claim
like
that
is
simply
untrue
it
might
make
for
useful
sound
bite
but
it
track
with
reality
what
is
true
is
said
if
going
to
drill
offshore
got
to
have
plan
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
kind
of
catastrophe
that
we
had
last
year
and
think
that
anybody
who
should
dispute
that
the
right
strategy
to
pursue
moreover
actually
pushing
the
oil
industry
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
already
got
right
now
the
industry
holds
tens
of
millions
of
acres
of
leases
where
not
producing
single
drop
just
sitting
on
supplies
of
american
energy
that
are
ready
to
be
tapped
why
part
of
our
plan
is
to
provide
new
and
better
incentives
that
promote
rapid
responsible
development
of
these
resources
also
exploring
and
assessing
new
frontiers
for
oil
and
gas
development
from
alaska
to
the
and
south
atlantic
states
because
producing
more
oil
in
america
can
help
lower
oil
prices
can
help
create
jobs
and
can
enhance
our
energy
security
but
got
to
do
it
in
the
right
way
now
even
if
we
increase
domestic
oil
production
that
is
not
going
to
be
the
solution
to
our
energy
challenge
give
out
this
statistic
all
the
time
and
forgive
me
for
repeating
it
again
america
holds
about
percent
of
the
proven
oil
reserves
what
that
means
is
is
that
even
if
we
drilled
every
drop
of
oil
out
of
every
single
one
of
the
reserves
that
we
possess
offshore
and
onshore
it
still
be
enough
to
meet
our
needs
we
consume
about
percent
of
the
oil
we
only
have
percent
of
the
reserves
even
if
we
doubled
oil
production
still
really
short
so
the
only
way
for
energy
supply
to
be
truly
secure
is
by
permanently
reducing
our
dependence
on
oil
going
to
have
to
find
ways
to
boost
our
efficiency
so
we
use
less
oil
got
to
discover
and
produce
cleaner
renewable
sources
of
energy
that
also
produce
less
carbon
pollution
which
is
threatening
our
climate
and
got
to
do
it
quickly
now
in
terms
of
new
sources
of
energy
we
have
few
different
options
the
first
is
natural
gas
recent
innovations
have
given
us
the
opportunity
to
tap
large
reserves
perhaps
worth
of
reserves
hundred
years
worth
of
reserves
in
the
shale
under
our
feet
but
just
as
is
true
in
terms
of
us
extracting
oil
from
the
ground
got
to
make
sure
that
extracting
natural
gas
safely
without
polluting
our
water
supply
why
asked
secretary
my
energy
secretary
to
work
with
other
agencies
the
natural
gas
industry
states
and
environmental
experts
to
improve
the
safety
of
this
process
and
is
the
right
guy
to
do
this
got
prize
in
physics
he
actually
deserved
his
prize
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
he
likes
to
do
for
fun
on
the
weekend
he
goes
into
his
garage
and
he
tinkers
around
and
figures
out
how
to
extract
natural
gas
going
to
embarrass
him
further
last
year
when
we
were
trying
to
fill
figure
out
how
to
close
the
cap
sent
down
to
sit
in
the
offices
and
he
essentially
designed
the
cap
that
ultimately
worked
and
he
drew
up
the
specs
for
it
and
had
build
it
construct
it
so
this
is
somebody
who
knows
what
doing
so
for
those
of
you
who
are
studying
physics
it
may
actually
pay
off
someday
but
the
potential
for
natural
gas
is
enormous
and
this
is
an
area
where
actually
been
some
broad
bipartisan
agreement
last
year
more
than
members
of
congress
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
produced
legislation
providing
incentives
to
use
natural
gas
in
our
vehicles
instead
of
oil
and
that
big
deal
getting
members
of
congress
to
agree
on
anything
is
big
deal
and
they
were
even
joined
by
businessman
who
made
his
fortune
on
oil
but
who
is
out
there
making
the
simple
point
that
we
simply
drill
our
way
out
of
our
energy
problems
so
ask
members
of
congress
and
all
the
interested
parties
involved
to
keep
at
it
pass
bill
that
helps
us
achieve
the
goal
of
extracting
natural
gas
in
safe
environmentally
sound
way
now
another
substitute
for
oil
that
holds
tremendous
promise
is
renewable
not
just
ethanol
but
made
from
things
like
and
wood
chips
and
biomass
if
anybody
doubts
the
potential
of
these
fuels
consider
brazil
as
said
was
just
there
last
week
half
of
vehicles
can
run
on
half
of
their
fleet
of
can
run
on
instead
of
petroleum
just
last
week
our
air
force
our
own
air
force
used
an
advanced
blend
to
fly
raptor
an
raptor
faster
than
the
speed
of
sound
think
about
that
mean
if
an
raptor
can
fly
at
the
speed
of
faster
than
the
speed
of
sound
on
biomass
then
know
the
old
beater
that
got
that
driving
around
in
can
probably
do
so
too
no
reason
why
we
have
our
cars
do
the
same
in
fact
the
air
force
is
aiming
to
get
half
of
its
domestic
jet
fuel
from
alternative
sources
by
and
directing
the
navy
and
the
department
of
energy
and
agriculture
to
work
with
the
private
sector
to
create
advanced
that
can
power
not
just
fighter
jets
but
also
trucks
and
commercial
airliners
so
no
reason
we
be
using
these
renewable
fuels
throughout
america
and
why
investing
in
things
like
stations
and
research
into
the
next
generation
of
one
of
the
biggest
problems
we
have
with
alternative
energy
is
not
just
producing
the
energy
but
also
distributing
it
got
gas
stations
all
around
the
country
so
whenever
you
need
gas
you
know
you
can
fill
up
it
matter
where
you
are
well
got
to
have
that
same
kind
of
distribution
network
when
it
comes
to
our
renewable
energy
sources
so
that
when
you
are
converting
to
different
kind
of
car
that
runs
on
different
kind
of
energy
going
to
be
able
to
have
that
same
convenience
otherwise
the
market
work
it
grow
over
the
next
two
years
help
entrepreneurs
break
ground
for
four
each
with
capacity
of
more
than
million
gallons
per
year
and
going
forward
we
should
look
for
ways
to
reform
incentives
to
make
sure
that
meeting
challenges
and
that
also
saving
taxpayers
money
so
as
we
replace
oil
with
fuels
like
natural
gas
and
we
can
also
reduce
our
dependence
by
making
cars
and
trucks
that
use
less
oil
in
the
first
place
seventy
percent
of
our
petroleum
consumption
goes
to
transportation
percent
and
by
the
way
so
does
the
second
biggest
chunk
of
most
budgets
goes
into
transportation
and
why
one
of
the
best
ways
to
make
our
economy
less
dependent
on
oil
and
save
folks
more
money
is
to
make
our
transportation
sector
more
efficient
now
we
went
through
years
where
we
raise
fuel
efficiency
standards
on
cars
and
part
of
what
happened
in
the
auto
industry
was
because
oil
appeared
relatively
cheap
the
auto
industry
decided
just
going
to
make
our
money
on
and
not
going
to
worry
about
fuel
efficiency
thirty
years
of
lost
time
when
it
comes
to
technology
that
could
improve
the
efficiency
of
cars
so
last
year
we
established
national
fuel
efficiency
standard
for
cars
and
trucks
we
did
this
last
year
without
legislation
we
just
got
all
the
parties
together
and
we
got
them
to
agree
environmental
groups
industry
so
that
means
our
cars
will
be
getting
better
gas
mileage
saving
billion
barrels
of
oil
over
the
life
of
the
program
billion
our
consumers
will
save
money
from
fewer
trips
to
the
pump
on
average
over
time
you
will
save
because
of
these
higher
fuel
efficiency
standards
and
our
will
build
more
innovative
products
right
now
there
are
even
cars
rolling
off
the
assembly
lines
in
detroit
with
combustion
engines
not
talking
about
hybrids
combustion
engines
that
get
more
than
miles
per
gallon
so
we
know
how
to
do
it
we
know
how
to
make
our
cars
more
efficient
but
going
forward
going
to
continue
to
work
with
the
with
the
with
states
to
ensure
the
cars
and
trucks
of
tomorrow
are
built
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
going
to
be
top
priority
for
us
this
summer
going
to
propose
the
fuel
efficiency
standards
for
trucks
and
this
fall
announce
the
next
round
of
fuel
standards
for
cars
that
builds
on
what
already
done
and
by
the
way
the
federal
government
is
going
to
need
to
lead
by
example
the
fleet
of
cars
and
trucks
we
use
in
the
federal
government
is
one
of
the
largest
in
the
country
got
lot
of
cars
and
why
already
doubled
the
number
of
alternative
vehicles
in
the
federal
fleet
and
why
today
am
directing
agencies
to
purchase
percent
alternative
fuel
hybrid
or
electric
vehicles
by
all
of
them
should
be
alternative
fuel
going
forward
partner
with
private
companies
that
want
to
upgrade
their
large
fleets
and
this
means
by
the
way
that
you
students
as
consumers
or
future
consumers
of
cars
got
to
make
sure
that
you
are
boosting
demand
for
alternative
vehicles
going
to
have
responsibility
as
well
because
if
vehicles
are
manufactured
but
you
guys
buying
them
then
folks
will
keep
on
making
cars
that
have
the
same
fuel
efficiency
so
got
power
in
this
process
and
the
decisions
you
make
individually
in
your
lives
will
say
something
about
how
serious
we
are
when
it
comes
to
energy
independence
also
made
historic
investments
in
rail
and
mass
transit
because
part
of
making
our
transportation
sector
cleaner
and
more
efficient
involves
offering
all
americans
whether
they
are
urban
suburban
or
rural
the
choice
to
be
mobile
without
having
to
get
in
car
and
pay
for
gas
still
there
are
few
breakthroughs
as
promising
for
increasing
fuel
efficiency
and
reducing
our
dependence
on
oil
as
electric
vehicles
soon
after
took
office
set
goal
of
having
one
million
electric
vehicles
on
our
roads
by
created
incentives
for
american
companies
to
develop
these
vehicles
and
for
americans
who
want
them
to
buy
them
so
new
manufacturing
plants
are
opening
over
the
next
few
years
and
modest
billion
investment
in
competitive
grants
for
companies
to
develop
the
next
generation
of
batteries
for
these
cars
has
big
new
american
industry
pretty
soon
america
will
be
home
to
percent
of
global
manufacturing
capacity
for
these
advanced
batteries
and
for
those
of
you
who
are
wondering
what
that
means
the
thing
been
holding
back
electric
vehicles
is
the
battery
that
stores
that
electricity
that
energy
and
the
more
efficient
the
more
lightweight
we
can
make
those
batteries
the
easier
it
is
to
manufacture
those
cars
at
competitive
price
and
if
we
can
have
that
industry
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
that
means
jobs
if
those
batteries
are
made
here
the
cars
are
made
here
those
cars
are
made
here
putting
americans
back
to
work
now
to
make
sure
we
stay
on
this
goal
going
to
need
to
do
more
by
offering
more
powerful
incentives
to
consumers
and
by
rewarding
the
communities
that
pave
the
way
for
the
adoption
of
these
vehicles
now
one
other
thing
about
electric
cars
and
you
do
need
to
talk
to
about
this
it
turns
out
electric
cars
run
on
electricity
and
so
even
if
we
reduce
our
oil
dependency
and
producing
all
these
great
electric
cars
going
to
have
to
have
plan
to
change
the
way
we
generate
electricity
in
america
so
that
cleaner
and
safer
and
healthier
we
know
that
ushering
in
clean
energy
economy
has
the
potential
of
creating
untold
numbers
of
new
jobs
and
new
businesses
right
here
in
the
united
states
but
going
to
have
to
think
about
how
do
we
produce
electricity
more
efficiently
now
in
addition
to
producing
it
we
actually
also
have
to
think
about
making
sure
not
wasting
energy
do
know
how
doing
on
the
campus
president
but
every
institution
and
every
household
has
to
start
thinking
about
how
are
we
reducing
the
amount
of
energy
that
using
and
doing
it
in
more
efficient
ways
today
our
homes
and
businesses
consume
percent
of
the
energy
that
we
use
and
it
costs
us
billions
of
dollars
in
energy
bills
manufacturers
that
require
large
amounts
of
energy
to
make
their
products
they
challenged
by
rising
energy
costs
and
so
you
separate
the
issue
of
oil
dependence
from
the
issue
of
how
we
are
producing
generally
more
energy
generally
and
why
proposed
new
programs
to
help
americans
upgrade
their
homes
and
businesses
and
plants
with
new
building
materials
new
lighting
new
windows
new
heating
and
cooling
systems
investments
that
will
save
consumers
and
business
owners
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
year
and
free
up
money
for
investment
and
hiring
and
creating
new
jobs
and
hiring
more
workers
and
putting
contractors
to
work
as
well
the
nice
thing
about
energy
efficiency
is
we
already
have
the
technology
we
have
to
create
something
new
we
just
have
to
help
businesses
and
homeowners
put
in
place
the
installation
the
windows
the
lighting
get
their
money
back
you
will
save
money
on
your
electricity
bill
that
pays
for
those
improvements
that
you
made
but
lot
of
people
may
not
have
the
money
up
front
and
so
got
to
give
them
some
incentives
to
do
that
and
just
like
the
fuels
we
use
in
our
cars
going
to
have
to
find
cleaner
renewable
sources
of
electricity
today
about
of
our
electricity
come
from
clean
energy
sources
but
we
can
do
better
than
that
think
that
with
the
right
incentives
in
place
we
can
double
our
use
of
clean
energy
and
why
in
my
state
of
the
union
address
back
in
january
called
for
new
clean
energy
standard
for
america
by
percent
of
our
electricity
needs
to
come
from
wide
range
of
clean
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
efficient
natural
gas
and
yes
going
to
have
to
examine
how
do
we
make
clean
coal
and
nuclear
power
work
now
in
light
of
the
ongoing
events
in
japan
want
to
just
take
minute
to
talk
about
nuclear
power
right
now
america
gets
about
of
our
electricity
from
nuclear
energy
and
important
to
that
nuclear
energy
emit
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
so
those
of
us
who
are
concerned
about
climate
change
got
to
that
nuclear
power
if
safe
can
make
significant
contribution
to
the
climate
change
question
and
determined
to
ensure
that
safe
so
in
light
of
happened
in
japan
requested
comprehensive
safety
review
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
to
make
sure
that
all
of
our
existing
nuclear
energy
facilities
are
safe
and
going
incorporate
those
conclusions
and
lessons
from
japan
in
design
and
the
building
of
the
next
generation
of
plants
but
we
simply
take
it
off
the
table
my
administration
is
leading
global
discussions
towards
new
international
framework
in
which
all
countries
who
are
operating
nuclear
plants
are
making
sure
that
not
spreading
dangerous
nuclear
materials
and
technology
but
more
broadly
clean
energy
standard
can
expand
the
scope
of
clean
energy
investments
because
what
it
does
is
it
gives
companies
the
certainty
that
they
need
to
invest
essentially
what
it
does
is
it
says
to
companies
you
know
what
you
will
have
customer
if
producing
clean
energy
utilities
they
need
to
buy
certain
amount
of
clean
energy
in
their
overall
portfolio
and
that
means
that
innovators
are
willing
to
make
those
big
capital
investments
and
got
to
start
now
because
think
about
this
in
the
america
was
home
to
more
than
percent
of
the
wind
capacity
percent
of
the
solar
capacity
we
were
the
leaders
in
wind
we
were
the
leaders
in
solar
we
owned
the
clean
energy
economy
in
the
guess
what
today
china
has
the
most
wind
capacity
germany
has
the
most
solar
capacity
both
invest
more
in
clean
energy
than
we
do
even
though
we
are
larger
economy
and
substantially
larger
user
of
energy
fallen
behind
on
what
is
going
to
be
the
key
to
our
future
other
countries
are
now
exporting
technology
we
pioneered
and
going
after
the
jobs
that
come
with
it
because
they
know
that
the
countries
that
lead
the
century
clean
energy
economy
will
be
the
countries
that
lead
the
century
global
economy
want
america
to
be
that
nation
want
america
to
win
the
future
so
clean
energy
standard
will
help
drive
private
investment
in
innovation
but
want
to
make
this
point
government
funding
will
still
be
critical
over
the
past
two
years
the
historic
investments
my
administration
has
made
in
clean
and
renewable
energy
research
and
technology
have
helped
private
sector
companies
grow
and
hire
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
workers
visited
gleaming
new
solar
arrays
that
are
among
the
largest
in
the
world
tested
an
electric
vehicle
fresh
off
the
assembly
line
mean
really
test
it
was
able
to
drive
like
five
feet
before
secret
service
said
to
stop
toured
factories
that
used
to
be
shuttered
where
now
building
advanced
wind
blades
that
are
as
long
as
and
building
the
towers
that
support
them
and
seen
the
scientists
that
are
searching
for
the
next
big
breakthrough
in
energy
none
of
this
would
have
happened
without
government
support
understand
got
tight
fiscal
situation
so
fair
to
ask
how
do
we
pay
for
investment
in
energy
and
as
we
debate
our
national
priorities
and
our
budget
in
congress
going
to
have
to
make
some
tough
choices
going
to
have
to
cut
what
we
need
to
invest
in
what
we
do
need
unfortunately
some
folks
want
to
cut
critical
investments
in
clean
energy
they
want
to
cut
our
research
and
development
into
new
technologies
the
resources
necessary
even
to
promptly
issue
new
permits
for
offshore
drilling
these
cuts
would
eliminate
thousands
of
private
sector
jobs
it
would
terminate
scientists
and
engineers
it
would
end
fellowships
for
researchers
some
who
may
be
here
at
graduate
students
and
other
talent
that
we
desperately
need
to
get
into
this
area
in
the
century
that
make
sense
already
paying
price
for
our
inaction
every
time
we
fill
up
at
the
pump
every
time
we
lose
job
or
business
to
countries
that
are
investing
more
than
we
do
in
clean
energy
when
it
comes
to
our
air
our
water
and
the
climate
change
that
threatens
the
planet
that
you
will
inherit
already
paying
price
these
are
costs
that
we
are
already
bearing
and
if
we
do
nothing
the
price
will
only
go
up
so
at
moments
like
these
sacrificing
these
investments
in
research
and
development
in
supporting
clean
energy
technologies
that
would
weaken
our
energy
economy
and
make
us
more
dependent
on
oil
not
game
plan
to
win
the
future
vision
to
keep
us
mired
in
the
past
will
not
accept
that
outcome
for
the
united
states
of
america
we
are
not
going
to
do
that
let
me
close
by
speaking
directly
to
the
students
here
the
next
generation
who
are
going
to
be
writing
the
next
great
chapter
in
the
american
story
the
issue
of
energy
independence
is
one
that
america
has
been
talking
about
since
before
your
parents
were
your
age
since
before
you
were
born
and
you
also
happen
to
go
to
school
in
town
that
for
long
time
has
suffered
from
chronic
unwillingness
to
come
together
and
make
tough
choices
and
so
forgive
you
for
thinking
that
maybe
there
much
we
can
do
to
rise
to
this
challenge
maybe
some
of
you
are
feeling
kind
of
cynical
or
about
whether
actually
going
to
solve
this
problem
but
everything
have
seen
and
experienced
with
your
generation
convinces
me
otherwise
think
that
precisely
because
you
are
coming
of
age
at
time
of
such
rapid
and
sometimes
unsettling
change
born
into
world
with
fewer
walls
educated
in
an
era
of
constant
information
tempered
by
war
and
economic
turmoil
because
the
world
in
which
coming
of
age
think
you
believe
as
deeply
as
any
of
our
previous
generations
that
america
can
change
and
it
can
change
for
the
better
we
need
that
we
need
you
to
dream
big
we
need
you
to
summon
that
same
spirit
of
unbridled
optimism
and
that
bold
willingness
to
tackle
tough
challenges
and
see
those
challenges
through
that
led
previous
generations
to
rise
to
greatness
to
save
democracy
to
touch
the
moon
to
connect
the
world
with
our
own
science
and
our
own
imagination
what
america
is
capable
of
that
what
you
have
to
push
america
to
do
and
it
will
be
you
that
pushes
it
that
history
of
ours
of
meeting
challenges
that
your
birthright
you
understand
that
no
problem
out
there
that
is
not
within
our
power
to
solve
want
to
leave
this
challenge
for
future
presidents
want
to
leave
it
for
my
children
want
to
leave
it
for
your
children
so
yes
solving
it
will
take
time
and
it
will
take
effort
it
will
require
our
brightest
scientists
our
most
creative
companies
it
will
require
all
of
us
democrats
republicans
and
everybody
in
between
to
do
our
part
but
with
confidence
in
america
and
in
ourselves
and
in
one
another
know
this
is
challenge
that
we
will
solve
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
tonight
like
to
update
the
american
people
on
the
international
effort
that
we
have
led
in
libya
what
done
what
we
plan
to
do
and
why
this
matters
to
us
want
to
begin
by
paying
tribute
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
once
again
have
acted
with
courage
professionalism
and
patriotism
they
have
moved
with
incredible
speed
and
strength
because
of
them
and
our
dedicated
diplomats
coalition
has
been
forged
and
countless
lives
have
been
saved
meanwhile
as
we
speak
our
troops
are
supporting
our
ally
japan
leaving
iraq
to
its
people
stopping
the
momentum
in
and
going
after
all
across
the
globe
as
grateful
to
our
soldiers
sailors
airmen
marines
coast
guardsmen
and
to
their
families
and
know
all
americans
share
in
that
sentiment
for
generations
the
united
states
of
america
has
played
unique
role
as
an
anchor
of
global
security
and
as
an
advocate
for
human
freedom
mindful
of
the
risks
and
costs
of
military
action
we
are
naturally
reluctant
to
use
force
to
solve
the
many
challenges
but
when
our
interests
and
values
are
at
stake
we
have
responsibility
to
act
what
happened
in
libya
over
the
course
of
these
last
six
weeks
libya
sits
directly
between
tunisia
and
egypt
two
nations
that
inspired
the
world
when
their
people
rose
up
to
take
control
of
their
own
destiny
for
more
than
four
decades
the
libyan
people
have
been
ruled
by
tyrant
he
has
denied
his
people
freedom
exploited
their
wealth
murdered
opponents
at
home
and
abroad
and
innocent
people
around
the
world
including
americans
who
were
killed
by
libyan
agents
last
month
grip
of
fear
appeared
to
give
way
to
the
promise
of
freedom
in
cities
and
towns
across
the
country
libyans
took
to
the
streets
to
claim
their
basic
human
rights
as
one
libyan
said
the
first
time
we
finally
have
hope
that
our
nightmare
of
years
will
soon
be
faced
with
this
opposition
began
attacking
his
people
as
president
my
immediate
concern
was
the
safety
of
our
citizens
so
we
evacuated
our
embassy
and
all
americans
who
sought
our
assistance
then
we
took
series
of
swift
steps
in
matter
of
days
to
answer
aggression
we
froze
more
than
billion
of
assets
joining
with
other
nations
at
the
united
nations
security
council
we
broadened
our
sanctions
imposed
an
arms
embargo
and
enabled
and
those
around
him
to
be
held
accountable
for
their
crimes
made
it
clear
that
had
lost
the
confidence
of
his
people
and
the
legitimacy
to
lead
and
said
that
he
needed
to
step
down
from
power
in
the
face
of
the
condemnation
chose
to
escalate
his
attacks
launching
military
campaign
against
the
libyan
people
innocent
people
were
targeted
for
killing
hospitals
and
ambulances
were
attacked
journalists
were
arrested
sexually
assaulted
and
killed
supplies
of
food
and
fuel
were
choked
off
water
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
in
was
shut
off
cities
and
towns
were
shelled
mosques
were
destroyed
and
apartment
buildings
reduced
to
rubble
military
jets
and
helicopter
gunships
were
unleashed
upon
people
who
had
no
means
to
defend
themselves
against
assaults
from
the
air
confronted
by
this
brutal
repression
and
looming
humanitarian
crisis
ordered
warships
into
the
european
allies
declared
their
willingness
to
commit
resources
to
stop
the
killing
the
libyan
opposition
and
the
arab
league
appealed
to
the
world
to
save
lives
in
libya
and
so
at
my
direction
america
led
an
effort
with
our
allies
at
the
united
nations
security
council
to
pass
historic
resolution
that
zone
to
stop
the
attacks
from
the
air
and
further
all
necessary
measures
to
protect
the
libyan
people
ten
days
ago
having
tried
to
end
the
violence
without
using
force
the
international
community
offered
final
chance
to
stop
his
campaign
of
killing
or
face
the
consequences
rather
than
stand
down
his
forces
continued
their
advance
bearing
down
on
the
city
of
home
to
nearly
men
women
and
children
who
sought
their
freedom
from
fear
at
this
point
the
united
states
and
the
world
faced
choice
declared
he
would
show
to
his
own
people
he
compared
them
to
rats
and
threatened
to
go
door
to
door
to
inflict
punishment
in
the
past
we
have
seen
him
hang
civilians
in
the
streets
and
kill
over
thousand
people
in
single
day
now
we
saw
regime
forces
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
we
knew
that
if
we
wanted
if
we
waited
one
more
day
city
nearly
the
size
of
could
suffer
massacre
that
would
have
reverberated
across
the
region
and
stained
the
conscience
of
the
world
it
was
not
in
our
national
interest
to
let
that
happen
refused
to
let
that
happen
and
so
nine
days
ago
after
consulting
the
bipartisan
leadership
of
congress
military
action
to
stop
the
killing
and
enforce
security
council
resolution
we
struck
regime
forces
approaching
to
save
that
city
and
the
people
within
it
we
hit
troops
in
allowing
the
opposition
to
drive
them
out
we
hit
air
defenses
which
paved
the
way
for
zone
we
targeted
tanks
and
military
assets
that
had
been
choking
off
towns
and
cities
and
we
cut
off
much
of
their
source
of
supply
and
tonight
can
report
that
we
have
stopped
deadly
advance
in
this
effort
the
united
states
has
not
acted
alone
instead
we
have
been
joined
by
strong
and
growing
coalition
this
includes
our
closest
allies
nations
like
the
united
kingdom
france
canada
denmark
norway
italy
spain
greece
and
turkey
all
of
whom
have
fought
by
our
sides
for
decades
and
it
includes
arab
partners
like
qatar
and
the
united
arab
emirates
who
have
chosen
to
meet
their
responsibilities
to
defend
the
libyan
people
to
then
in
just
one
month
the
united
states
has
worked
with
our
international
partners
to
broad
coalition
secure
an
international
mandate
to
protect
civilians
stop
an
advancing
army
prevent
massacre
and
establish
zone
with
our
allies
and
partners
to
lend
some
perspective
on
how
rapidly
this
military
and
diplomatic
response
came
together
when
people
were
being
in
bosnia
in
the
it
took
the
international
community
more
than
year
to
intervene
with
air
power
to
protect
civilians
it
took
us
days
moreover
accomplished
these
objectives
consistent
with
the
pledge
that
made
to
the
american
people
at
the
outset
of
our
military
operations
said
that
role
would
be
limited
that
we
would
not
put
ground
troops
into
libya
that
we
would
focus
our
unique
capabilities
on
the
front
end
of
the
operation
and
that
we
would
transfer
responsibility
to
our
allies
and
partners
tonight
we
are
fulfilling
that
pledge
our
most
effective
alliance
nato
has
taken
command
of
the
enforcement
of
the
arms
embargo
and
the
zone
last
night
nato
decided
to
take
on
the
additional
responsibility
of
protecting
libyan
civilians
this
transfer
from
the
united
states
to
nato
will
take
place
on
going
forward
the
lead
in
enforcing
the
zone
and
protecting
civilians
on
the
ground
will
transition
to
our
allies
and
partners
and
am
fully
confident
that
our
coalition
will
keep
the
pressure
on
remaining
forces
in
that
effort
the
united
states
will
play
supporting
role
including
intelligence
logistical
support
search
and
rescue
assistance
and
capabilities
to
jam
regime
communications
because
of
this
transition
to
broader
coalition
the
risk
and
cost
of
this
operation
to
our
military
and
to
american
taxpayers
will
be
reduced
significantly
so
for
those
who
doubted
our
capacity
to
carry
out
this
operation
want
to
be
clear
the
united
states
of
america
has
done
what
we
said
we
would
do
not
to
say
that
our
work
is
complete
in
addition
to
our
nato
responsibilities
we
will
work
with
the
international
community
to
provide
assistance
to
the
people
of
libya
who
need
food
for
the
hungry
and
medical
care
for
the
wounded
we
will
safeguard
the
more
than
billion
that
was
frozen
from
the
regime
so
that
available
to
rebuild
libya
after
all
the
money
belong
to
or
to
us
it
belongs
to
the
libyan
people
and
make
sure
they
receive
it
tomorrow
secretary
will
go
to
london
where
she
will
meet
with
the
libyan
opposition
and
consult
with
more
than
nations
these
discussions
will
focus
on
what
kind
of
political
effort
is
necessary
to
pressure
while
also
supporting
transition
to
the
future
that
the
libyan
people
deserve
because
while
our
military
mission
is
narrowly
focused
on
saving
lives
we
continue
to
pursue
the
broader
goal
of
libya
that
belongs
not
to
dictator
but
to
its
people
now
despite
the
success
of
our
efforts
over
the
past
week
know
that
some
americans
continue
to
have
questions
about
our
efforts
in
libya
has
not
yet
stepped
down
from
power
and
until
he
does
libya
will
remain
dangerous
moreover
even
after
does
leave
power
years
of
tyranny
has
left
libya
fractured
and
without
strong
civil
institutions
the
transition
to
legitimate
government
that
is
responsive
to
the
libyan
people
will
be
difficult
task
and
while
the
united
states
will
do
our
part
to
help
it
will
be
task
for
the
international
community
and
more
importantly
task
for
the
libyan
people
themselves
in
fact
much
of
the
debate
in
washington
has
put
forward
false
choice
when
it
comes
to
libya
on
the
one
hand
some
question
why
america
should
intervene
at
all
even
in
limited
ways
in
this
distant
land
they
argue
that
there
are
many
places
in
the
world
where
innocent
civilians
face
brutal
violence
at
the
hands
of
their
government
and
america
should
not
be
expected
to
police
the
world
particularly
when
we
have
so
many
pressing
needs
here
at
home
true
that
america
can
not
use
our
military
wherever
repression
occurs
and
given
the
costs
and
risks
of
intervention
we
must
always
measure
our
interests
against
the
need
for
action
but
that
can
not
be
an
argument
for
never
acting
on
behalf
of
right
in
this
particular
country
libya
at
this
particular
moment
we
were
faced
with
the
prospect
of
violence
on
horrific
scale
we
had
unique
ability
to
stop
that
violence
an
international
mandate
for
action
broad
coalition
prepared
to
join
us
the
support
of
arab
countries
and
plea
for
help
from
the
libyan
people
themselves
we
also
had
the
ability
to
stop
forces
in
their
tracks
without
putting
american
troops
on
the
ground
to
brush
aside
responsibility
as
leader
and
more
profoundly
our
responsibilities
to
our
fellow
human
beings
under
such
circumstances
would
have
been
betrayal
of
who
we
are
some
nations
may
be
able
to
turn
blind
eye
to
atrocities
in
other
countries
the
united
states
of
america
is
different
and
as
president
refused
to
wait
for
the
images
of
slaughter
and
mass
graves
before
taking
action
moreover
america
has
an
important
strategic
interest
in
preventing
from
overrunning
those
who
oppose
him
massacre
would
have
driven
thousands
of
additional
refugees
across
borders
putting
enormous
strains
on
the
peaceful
yet
fragile
transitions
in
egypt
and
tunisia
the
democratic
impulses
that
are
dawning
across
the
region
would
be
eclipsed
by
the
darkest
form
of
dictatorship
as
repressive
leaders
concluded
that
violence
is
the
best
strategy
to
cling
to
power
the
writ
of
the
united
nations
security
council
would
have
been
shown
to
be
little
more
than
empty
words
crippling
that
future
credibility
to
uphold
global
peace
and
security
so
while
will
never
the
costs
involved
in
military
action
am
convinced
that
failure
to
act
in
libya
would
have
carried
far
greater
price
for
america
now
just
as
there
are
those
who
have
argued
against
intervention
in
libya
there
are
others
who
have
suggested
that
we
broaden
our
military
mission
beyond
the
task
of
protecting
the
libyan
people
and
do
whatever
it
takes
to
bring
down
and
usher
in
new
government
of
course
there
is
no
question
that
libya
and
the
world
would
be
better
off
with
out
of
power
along
with
many
other
world
leaders
have
embraced
that
goal
and
will
actively
pursue
it
through
means
but
broadening
our
military
mission
to
include
regime
change
would
be
mistake
the
task
that
assigned
our
forces
to
protect
the
libyan
people
from
immediate
danger
and
to
establish
zone
carries
with
it
mandate
and
international
support
also
what
the
libyan
opposition
asked
us
to
do
if
we
tried
to
overthrow
by
force
our
coalition
would
splinter
we
would
likely
have
to
put
troops
on
the
ground
to
accomplish
that
mission
or
risk
killing
many
civilians
from
the
air
the
dangers
faced
by
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
would
be
far
greater
so
would
the
costs
and
our
share
of
the
responsibility
for
what
comes
next
to
be
blunt
we
went
down
that
road
in
iraq
thanks
to
the
extraordinary
sacrifices
of
our
troops
and
the
determination
of
our
diplomats
we
are
hopeful
about
future
but
regime
change
there
took
eight
years
thousands
of
american
and
iraqi
lives
and
nearly
trillion
dollars
that
is
not
something
we
can
afford
to
repeat
in
libya
as
the
bulk
of
our
military
effort
down
what
we
can
do
and
will
do
is
support
the
aspirations
of
the
libyan
people
we
have
intervened
to
stop
massacre
and
we
will
work
with
our
allies
and
partners
to
maintain
the
safety
of
civilians
we
will
deny
the
regime
arms
cut
off
its
supplies
of
cash
assist
the
opposition
and
work
with
other
nations
to
hasten
the
day
when
leaves
power
it
may
not
happen
overnight
as
badly
weakened
tries
desperately
to
hang
on
to
power
but
it
should
be
clear
to
those
around
and
to
every
libyan
that
history
is
not
on
side
with
the
time
and
space
that
we
have
provided
for
the
libyan
people
they
will
be
able
to
determine
their
own
destiny
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
let
me
close
by
addressing
what
this
action
says
about
the
use
of
military
power
and
broader
leadership
in
the
world
under
my
presidency
as
have
no
greater
responsibility
than
keeping
this
country
safe
and
no
decision
weighs
on
me
more
than
when
to
deploy
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
made
it
clear
that
will
never
hesitate
to
use
our
military
swiftly
decisively
and
unilaterally
when
necessary
to
defend
our
people
our
homeland
our
allies
and
our
core
interests
that
why
going
after
wherever
they
seek
foothold
that
is
why
we
continue
to
fight
in
even
as
we
have
ended
our
combat
mission
in
iraq
and
removed
more
than
troops
from
that
country
there
will
be
times
though
when
our
safety
is
not
directly
threatened
but
our
interests
and
our
values
are
sometimes
the
course
of
history
poses
challenges
that
threaten
our
common
humanity
and
our
common
security
responding
to
natural
disasters
for
example
or
preventing
genocide
and
keeping
the
peace
ensuring
regional
security
and
maintaining
the
flow
of
commerce
these
may
not
be
problems
alone
but
they
are
important
to
us
problems
worth
solving
and
in
these
circumstances
we
know
that
the
united
states
as
the
most
powerful
nation
will
often
be
called
upon
to
help
in
such
cases
we
should
not
be
afraid
to
act
but
the
burden
of
action
should
not
be
alone
as
we
have
in
libya
our
task
is
instead
to
the
international
community
for
collective
action
because
contrary
to
the
claims
of
some
american
leadership
is
not
simply
matter
of
going
it
alone
and
bearing
all
of
the
burden
ourselves
real
leadership
creates
the
conditions
and
coalitions
for
others
to
step
up
as
well
to
work
with
allies
and
partners
so
that
they
bear
their
share
of
the
burden
and
pay
their
share
of
the
costs
and
to
see
that
the
principles
of
justice
and
human
dignity
are
upheld
by
all
the
kind
of
leadership
shown
in
libya
of
course
even
when
we
act
as
part
of
coalition
the
risks
of
any
military
action
will
be
high
those
risks
were
when
one
of
our
planes
malfunctioned
over
libya
yet
when
one
of
our
airmen
parachuted
to
the
ground
in
country
whose
leader
has
so
often
the
united
states
in
region
that
has
such
difficult
history
with
our
country
this
american
did
not
find
enemies
instead
he
was
met
by
people
who
embraced
him
one
young
libyan
who
came
to
his
aid
said
are
your
friends
we
are
so
grateful
to
those
men
who
are
protecting
the
this
voice
is
just
one
of
many
in
region
where
new
generation
is
refusing
to
be
denied
their
rights
and
opportunities
any
longer
yes
this
change
will
make
the
world
more
complicated
for
time
progress
will
be
uneven
and
change
will
come
differently
to
different
countries
there
are
places
like
egypt
where
this
change
will
inspire
us
and
raise
our
hopes
and
then
there
will
be
places
like
iran
where
change
is
fiercely
suppressed
the
dark
forces
of
civil
conflict
and
sectarian
war
will
have
to
be
averted
and
difficult
political
and
economic
concerns
will
have
to
be
addressed
the
united
states
will
not
be
able
to
dictate
the
pace
and
scope
of
this
change
only
the
people
of
the
region
can
do
that
but
we
can
make
difference
believe
that
this
movement
of
change
can
not
be
turned
back
and
that
we
must
stand
alongside
those
who
believe
in
the
same
core
principles
that
have
guided
us
through
many
storms
our
opposition
to
violence
directed
at
own
people
our
support
for
set
of
universal
rights
including
the
freedom
for
people
to
express
themselves
and
choose
their
leaders
our
support
for
governments
that
are
ultimately
responsive
to
the
aspirations
of
the
people
born
as
we
are
out
of
revolution
by
those
who
longed
to
be
free
we
welcome
the
fact
that
history
is
on
the
move
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
and
that
young
people
are
leading
the
way
because
wherever
people
long
to
be
free
they
will
find
friend
in
the
united
states
ultimately
it
is
that
faith
those
ideals
that
are
the
true
measure
of
american
leadership
my
fellow
americans
know
that
at
time
of
upheaval
overseas
when
the
news
is
filled
with
conflict
and
change
it
can
be
tempting
to
turn
away
from
the
world
and
as
said
before
our
strength
abroad
is
anchored
in
our
strength
here
at
home
that
must
always
be
our
north
star
the
ability
of
our
people
to
reach
their
potential
to
make
wise
choices
with
our
resources
to
enlarge
the
prosperity
that
serves
as
for
our
power
and
to
live
the
values
that
we
hold
so
dear
but
let
us
also
remember
that
for
generations
we
have
done
the
hard
work
of
protecting
our
own
people
as
well
as
millions
around
the
globe
we
have
done
so
because
we
know
that
our
own
future
is
safer
our
own
future
is
brighter
if
more
of
mankind
can
live
with
the
bright
light
of
freedom
and
dignity
tonight
let
us
give
thanks
for
the
americans
who
are
serving
through
these
trying
times
and
the
coalition
that
is
carrying
our
effort
forward
and
let
us
look
to
the
future
with
confidence
and
hope
not
only
for
our
own
country
but
for
all
those
yearning
for
freedom
around
the
world
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america

you

you
please
please
everyone

seated
thank
you
it
is
wonderful
to
be
here
in
santiago
and
want
to
first
of
all
thank
your
president
president
for
his
outstanding
leadership
and
the
hospitality
that
extended
not
only
to
me
but
also
to
my
wife
my
daughters
and
most
importantly
my
to
the
people
of
santiago
to
the
people
of
thank

so
much
for
your
wonderful
welcome
and
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
let
me
thank
you
for
your
friendship
and
the
strong
bonds
between
our
people
there
are
several
people
that
just
want
to
acknowledge
very
briefly
we
have
the
president
of
the
development
bank
who
is
here
we
also
have
who
is
the
executive
secretary
of
the
economic
commission
for
latin
america
and
the
throughout
our
history
this
land
has
been
called
fin
the
end
of
the
world
but
come
here
today
because
in
the
century
this
nation
is
vital
part
of
our
interconnected
world
in
an
age
when
peoples
are
intertwined
like
never
before
shows
that
we
need
not
be
divided
by
race
or
religion
or
ethnic
conflict
welcomed
immigrants
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
even
as
you
celebrate
proud
indigenous
heritage
at
time
when
people
around
the
world
are
reaching
for
their
freedoms
shows
that
yes
it
is
possible
to
transition
from
dictatorship
to
democracy
and
to
do
so
peacefully
indeed
our
surroundings
today
just
steps
from
where
lost
its
democracy
decades
ago
is
testament
to
progress
and
its
undying
democratic
spirit
despite
barriers
of
distance
and
geography
integrated
into
the
global
economy
trading
with
countries
all
over
the
world
and
in
this
internet
age
becoming
the
most
digitally
connected
country
in
latin
america
and
in
world
of
sometimes
wrenching
pain
as
seeing
today
in
japan
it
is
the
character
of
this
country
that
inspires
original
guiding
stars
said
struggle
and
but
he
added
is
no
such
thing
as
lone
struggle
no
such
thing
as
lone
the
chilean
people
have
shown
this
time
and
again
including
your
recovery
from
the
terrible
earthquake
here
one
year
ago
credit
for
success
belongs
to
the
chilean
people
whose
courage
sacrifices
and
perseverance
built
this
nation
into
the
leader
that
it
is
and
we
are
very
to
be
joined
today
by
four
leaders
who
have
guided
this
nation
through
years
of
great
progress
presidents
lagos
and
of
course
your
current
president
thank
you
all
to
the
former
presidents
for
being
here
as
well
as
president
so
could
not
imagine
more
fitting
place
to
discuss
the
new
era
of
partnership
that
the
united
states
is
pursuing
not
only
with
but
across
the
and
grateful
that
joined
by
leaders
and
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
from
across
the
region
within
my
first
days
in
office
one
of
my
first
foreign
trips
as
president
to
trinidad
and
tobago
to
meet
with
leaders
from
across
the
hemisphere
at
the
summit
of
the
and
there
pledged
to
seek
partnerships
of
equality
and
shared
responsibility
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
but
also
on
shared
values
now
know
not
the
first
president
from
the
united
states
to
pledge
new
spirit
of
partnership
with
our
latin
american
words
are
easy
and
know
that
there
have
been
times
where
perhaps
the
united
states
took
this
region
for
granted
even
now
know
our
headlines
are
often
dominated
by
events
in
other
parts
of
the
world
but
never
forget
every
day
the
future
is
being
forged
by
the
countries
and
peoples
of
latin
america
for
latin
america
is
not
the
old
stereotype
of
region
of
in
perpetual
conflict
or
trapped
in
endless
cycles
of
poverty
the
world
must
now
latin
america
for
the
dynamic
and
growing
region
that
it
truly
is
latin
america
is
at
peace
civil
wars
have
ended
have
been
pushed
back
old
border
disputes
have
been
resolved
in
great
sacrifices
by
citizens
and
security
forces
have
restored
level
of
security
not
seen
in
decades
and
just
as
old
conflicts
have
receded
so
too
have
the
ideological
battles
that
often
them
the
old
stale
debates
between
economies
and
unbridled
capitalism
between
the
abuses
of
paramilitaries
and
insurgents
between
those
who
believe
that
the
united
states
causes
all
the
problems
and
those
who
believe
that
the
united
states
ignores
all
the
problems
those
are
false
choices
and
they
reflect
realities
today
latin
america
is
democratic
virtually
all
the
people
of
latin
america
have
gone
from
living
under
dictatorships
to
living
in
democracies
across
the
region
we
see
vibrant
democracies
from
mexico
to
to
seen
historic
peaceful
transfers
of
power
from
to
uruguay
to
paraguay
the
work
of
perfecting
our
democracies
of
course
is
never
truly
done
but
this
is
the
outstanding
progress
been
made
here
in
the
today
latin
america
is
growing
having
made
tough
but
necessary
reforms
nations
like
peru
and
brazil
are
seeing
impressive
growth
as
result
latin
america
weathered
the
global
economic
downturn
better
than
other
regions
across
the
region
tens
of
millions
of
people
have
been
lifted
from
extreme
poverty
from
to
santiago
to
new
middle
class
is
demanding
more
of
themselves
and
more
of
their
governments
latin
america
is
coming
together
to
address
shared
challenges
and
mexico
are
sharing
their
expertise
in
security
with
nations
in
central
america
when
coup
in
threatened
democratic
progress
the
nations
of
the
hemisphere
unanimously
invoked
the
democratic
charter
helping
to
lay
the
foundation
for
the
return
to
the
rule
of
law
the
contributions
of
latin
american
countries
have
been
critical
in
haiti
as
has
latin
american
diplomacy
in
the
lead
up
to
election
in
haiti
and
increasingly
latin
america
is
contributing
to
global
prosperity
and
security
as
contributors
to
united
nations
peacekeeping
missions
latin
american
nations
have
helped
to
prevent
conflicts
from
africa
to
asia
at
the
nations
like
mexico
brazil
now
have
greater
voice
in
global
economic
under
mexican
leadership
the
world
made
progress
at
in
our
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
nations
like
have
played
leading
role
in
strengthening
civil
society
groups
around
the
world
so
this
is
the
latin
america
that
see
today
region
on
the
move
proud
of
its
progress
and
ready
to
assume
greater
role
in
world
affairs
and
for
all
these
reasons
believe
that
latin
america
is
more
important
to
the
prosperity
and
security
of
the
united
states
than
ever
before
with
no
other
region
does
the
united
states
have
so
many
connections
and
nowhere
do
we
see
that
more
than
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
hispanic
americans
across
the
united
states
who
enrich
our
society
grow
our
economy
and
strengthen
our
nation
every
single
day
and
believe
latin
america
is
only
going
to
become
more
important
to
the
united
states
especially
to
our
economy
trade
between
the
united
states
and
latin
america
has
surged
we
buy
more
of
your
products
more
of
your
goods
than
any
other
country
and
we
invest
more
in
this
region
than
any
other
country
for
instance
we
export
more
than
three
times
as
much
to
latin
america
as
we
do
to
china
our
exports
to
this
region
which
are
growing
faster
than
our
exports
to
the
rest
of
the
world
will
soon
support
more
than
million
jobs
in
other
words
when
latin
america
is
more
prosperous
the
united
states
is
more
prosperous
but
even
more
than
interests
bound
by
shared
values
in
each
journey
we
see
reflections
of
our
own
colonists
who
broke
free
from
empires
pioneers
who
opened
new
frontiers
citizens
who
have
struggled
to
expand
our
promise
to
all
people
men
and
women
white
black
and
brown
people
of
faith
who
must
remember
that
all
of
us
especially
the
most
fortunate
among
us
must
do
our
part
especially
for
the
least
among
us
citizens
who
know
that
ensuring
that
democracies
deliver
for
our
people
must
be
the
work
of
all
this
is
our
common
history
this
is
our
common
heritage
we
are
all
americans
across
the
parents
want
their
children
to
be
able
to
run
and
play
and
know
that
come
home
safely
young
people
all
desperately
want
an
education
fathers
want
the
dignity
that
comes
from
work
and
women
want
the
same
opportunities
as
their
husbands
entrepreneurs
want
the
chance
to
start
that
new
business
and
people
everywhere
want
to
be
treated
with
the
respect
to
which
every
human
being
is
entitled
these
are
the
hopes
simple
yet
profound
that
beat
in
the
hearts
of
millions
across
the
but
if
honest
also
admit
that
that
these
dreams
are
still
beyond
the
reach
of
too
many
that
progress
in
the
has
not
come
fast
enough
not
for
the
millions
who
endure
the
injustice
of
extreme
poverty
not
for
the
children
in
and
the
who
just
want
the
same
chance
as
everybody
else
not
for
the
communities
that
are
caught
in
the
brutal
grips
of
cartels
and
gangs
where
the
police
are
and
too
many
people
live
in
fear
and
despite
this
democratic
progress
stark
inequalities
endure
in
political
and
economic
power
that
is
too
often
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
few
instead
of
serving
the
many
in
the
corruption
that
too
often
still
stifles
economic
growth
and
development
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
and
in
some
leaders
who
cling
to
bankrupt
ideologies
to
justify
their
own
power
and
who
seek
to
silence
their
opponents
because
those
opponents
have
the
audacity
to
demand
their
universal
rights
these
too
are
realities
that
we
must
face
of
course
we
are
not
the
first
generation
to
face
these
challenges
fifty
years
ago
this
month
president
john
kennedy
proposed
an
ambitious
alliance
for
progress
it
was
even
by
standards
massive
investment
billions
of
dollars
to
meet
the
basic
needs
of
people
across
the
region
such
program
was
right
it
was
appropriate
for
that
era
but
the
realities
of
our
time
and
the
new
capabilities
and
confidence
of
latin
america
demand
something
different
president
challenge
endures
build
hemisphere
where
all
people
can
hope
for
sustainable
suitable
standard
of
living
and
all
can
live
out
their
lives
in
dignity
and
in
but
half
century
later
we
must
give
meaning
to
this
work
in
our
own
way
in
new
way
believe
that
in
the
today
there
are
no
senior
partners
and
there
are
no
junior
partners
there
are
only
equal
partners
of
course
equal
partnerships
in
turn
demands
sense
of
shared
responsibility
we
have
obligations
to
each
other
and
today
the
united
states
is
working
with
the
nations
of
this
hemisphere
to
meet
our
responsibilities
in
several
key
areas
first
partnering
to
address
the
concerns
that
people
across
the
say
they
worry
about
the
most
and
that
the
security
of
their
families
and
communities
criminal
gangs
and
are
not
only
threat
to
the
security
of
our
citizens
threat
to
development
because
they
scare
away
investment
that
economies
need
to
prosper
and
they
are
direct
threat
to
democracy
because
they
fuel
the
corruption
that
rots
institutions
from
within
so
with
our
partners
from
to
mexico
and
new
regional
initiatives
in
central
america
and
the
confronting
this
challenge
together
from
every
direction
increased
our
support
the
equipment
training
and
technologies
that
security
forces
border
security
and
police
need
to
keep
communities
safe
improving
coordination
and
sharing
more
information
so
that
those
who
traffic
in
drugs
and
in
human
beings
have
fewer
places
to
hide
and
putting
unprecedented
pressure
on
cartel
finances
including
in
the
united
states
but
never
break
the
grip
of
the
cartels
and
the
gangs
unless
we
also
address
the
social
and
economic
forces
that
fuel
criminality
we
need
to
reach
youth
before
they
turn
to
drugs
and
crime
so
joining
with
partners
across
the
to
expand
policing
strengthen
juvenile
justice
systems
and
invest
in
crime
and
drug
prevention
programs
as
the
nations
of
central
american
develop
new
regional
security
strategy
the
united
states
stands
ready
to
do
our
part
through
new
partnership
that
puts
the
focus
where
it
should
be
on
the
security
of
citizens
and
with
regional
and
international
partners
make
sure
our
support
is
not
just
but
is
and
said
before
and
will
repeat
as
president
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
shares
and
accepts
our
share
of
responsibility
for
drug
violence
after
all
the
demand
for
drugs
including
in
the
united
states
drives
this
crisis
and
why
developed
new
drug
control
strategy
that
focused
on
reducing
the
demand
for
drugs
through
education
and
prevention
and
treatment
and
would
point
out
that
even
during
difficult
fiscal
times
in
the
united
states
proposed
increasing
our
commitment
to
these
efforts
by
some
billion
this
year
alone
also
doing
more
to
stem
the
southbound
flow
of
guns
into
the
region
screening
all
southbound
rail
cargo
seizing
many
more
guns
bound
for
mexico
and
putting
more
behind
bars
and
every
gun
or
that
we
take
off
the
streets
is
one
less
threat
to
the
families
and
communities
of
the
as
we
work
to
ensure
the
security
of
our
citizens
partnering
in
second
area
and
that
promoting
prosperity
and
opportunity
been
so
impressed
with
president
pledge
to
lift
everyone
out
of
extreme
poverty
by
that
an
ambitious
goal
and
an
appropriate
goal
and
with
this
trip
working
to
expand
some
of
the
trade
and
investment
that
might
help
achieve
this
goal
across
the
region
moving
ahead
with
agreements
to
bring
our
people
and
businesses
closer
together
moving
forward
with
our
partnership
which
includes
and
peru
to
create
new
trade
opportunities
in
the
markets
of
the
and
as
directed
my
administration
has
intensified
our
efforts
to
move
forward
on
trade
agreements
with
panama
and
consistent
with
our
values
and
with
our
interests
also
encouraging
the
next
generation
of
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
so
work
with
the
development
bank
to
increase
lending
expanded
credit
under
new
growth
fund
for
the
supporting
reforms
to
tax
systems
which
are
critical
for
economic
growth
and
public
investment
creating
new
to
entrepreneurship
training
for
those
who
must
share
in
economic
growth
including
women
and
members
of
and
indigenous
communities
and
coming
together
as
hemisphere
to
create
clean
energy
jobs
and
pursue
more
secure
and
sustainable
energy
futures
and
if
anybody
doubts
the
urgency
of
climate
change
they
look
they
should
look
no
further
than
the
from
the
stronger
storms
in
the
to
glacier
melt
in
the
andes
to
the
loss
of
forests
and
farmland
across
the
region
under
the
energy
and
climate
partnership
of
the
that
proposed
countries
have
stepped
forward
each
providing
leadership
and
expertise
brazil
has
expertise
in
in
geothermal
mexico
on
energy
efficiency
is
connecting
grids
in
central
america
to
make
electricity
more
reliable
these
are
exactly
the
kind
of
partnerships
that
we
need
joining
with
to
unleash
the
progress
that
none
of
us
can
achieve
alone
the
same
philosophy
behind
two
additional
initiatives
that
announcing
today
which
will
help
our
countries
educate
and
innovate
for
the
future
first
launching
new
initiative
to
harness
the
power
of
social
media
and
networks
to
help
students
scientists
academics
and
entrepreneurs
collaborate
and
develop
the
new
ideas
and
products
that
will
keep
america
the
competitive
in
global
economy
and
proud
to
announce
that
the
united
states
will
work
with
partners
in
this
region
including
the
private
sector
to
increase
the
number
of
students
studying
in
latin
america
to
and
the
number
of
latin
america
students
studying
in
the
united
states
to
staying
competitive
also
of
course
demands
that
we
address
immigration
an
issue
that
evokes
great
passions
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
the
as
president
made
it
clear
that
immigration
strengthens
the
united
states
we
are
nation
of
immigrants
which
is
why
have
consistently
spoken
out
against
sentiment
also
nation
of
laws
which
is
why
will
not
waver
in
my
determination
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
committed
to
comprehensive
reform
that
secures
our
borders
enforces
our
laws
and
addresses
the
millions
of
undocumented
workers
who
are
living
in
the
shadows
of
the
united
states
believe
though
that
this
challenge
will
be
with
us
for
very
long
time
so
long
as
people
believe
that
the
only
way
to
provide
for
their
families
is
to
leave
their
families
and
head
north
and
why
the
united
states
has
to
continue
to
partner
with
countries
that
pursue
the
economic
growth
that
gives
people
and
nations
path
out
of
poverty
and
what
seeing
here
in
as
part
of
our
new
approach
to
development
working
with
partners
like
and
who
are
committed
to
building
their
own
capacity
from
helping
farmers
improve
crop
yields
to
helping
health
care
systems
to
deliver
better
care
which
leads
me
to
the
final
area
where
we
must
continue
to
partner
and
strengthening
democracy
and
human
rights
more
than
years
ago
our
nations
came
together
in
an
of
american
states
and
declared
and
quote
that
democracy
is
an
indispensable
condition
for
the
stability
peace
and
development
of
the
decade
ago
we
reaffirmed
this
principle
with
an
democratic
charter
that
stated
and
quote
people
of
the
have
right
to
democracy
and
their
governments
have
an
obligation
to
promote
and
defend
across
the
generations
including
generations
of
have
struggled
and
sacrificed
to
give
meaning
to
these
words
ordinary
men
and
women
who
dared
to
speak
their
mind
activists
who
new
movements
faith
leaders
who
preached
social
justice
the
mothers
of
the
disappeared
who
demanded
the
truth
political
prisoners
who
rose
to
become
presidents
and
even
now
las
who
march
in
quiet
dignity
the
people
of
the
have
shown
that
there
is
no
substitute
for
democracy
as
governments
we
have
then
an
obligation
to
defend
what
has
been
won
so
as
we
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
democratic
charter
this
year
reaffirm
the
principles
that
we
know
to
be
true
to
defending
democracy
and
human
rights
in
our
own
countries
by
strengthening
the
institutions
that
democracy
needs
to
flourish
free
and
fair
elections
in
which
people
choose
their
own
leaders
vibrant
legislatures
that
provide
oversight
independent
judiciaries
that
uphold
the
rule
of
law
free
press
that
promotes
open
debate
professional
under
civilian
control
strong
civil
societies
that
hold
governments
accountable
and
governments
that
are
transparent
and
responsive
to
their
citizens
this
is
what
makes
democracy
and
just
as
we
defend
democracy
and
human
rights
within
our
borders
to
defending
them
across
our
hemisphere
understand
every
nation
will
follow
its
own
path
no
nation
should
impose
its
will
on
another
but
surely
we
can
agree
that
democracy
is
about
more
than
majority
rule
that
simply
holding
power
does
not
give
leader
the
right
to
suppress
the
rights
of
others
and
that
leaders
must
maintain
power
through
consent
and
not
coercion
we
have
to
speak
out
when
we
see
those
principles
violated
never
waver
in
our
support
for
the
rights
of
people
to
determine
their
own
future
and
yes
that
includes
the
people
of
cuba
since
taking
office
announced
the
most
significant
changes
to
my
policy
towards
cuba
in
decades
made
it
possible
for
cuban
americans
to
visit
and
support
their
families
in
cuba
allowing
americans
to
send
remittances
that
bring
some
economic
hope
for
people
across
cuba
as
well
as
more
independence
from
cuban
authorities
going
forward
continue
to
seek
ways
to
increase
the
independence
of
the
cuban
people
who
believe
are
entitled
to
the
same
freedom
and
liberty
as
everyone
else
in
this
hemisphere
will
make
this
effort
to
try
to
break
out
of
this
history
now
lasted
for
longer
than
been
alive
but
cuban
authorities
must
take
some
meaningful
actions
to
respect
the
basic
rights
of
their
own
people
not
because
the
united
states
insists
upon
it
but
because
the
people
of
cuba
deserve
it
no
less
than
the
people
of
the
united
states
or
or
brazil
or
any
other
country
deserve
it
the
lessons
of
latin
america
believe
can
be
guide
guide
for
people
around
the
world
who
are
beginning
their
own
journeys
toward
democracy
there
is
no
one
model
for
democratic
transitions
but
as
this
region
knows
successful
transitions
do
have
certain
ingredients
the
moral
force
of
nonviolence
dialogue
open
and
inclusive
the
protection
of
basic
rights
such
as
peaceful
expression
and
assembly
accountability
for
past
wrongs
and
matching
political
reform
with
economic
reform
because
democracy
must
meet
the
basic
needs
and
aspirations
of
people
with
decades
of
experience
so
much
latin
america
can
now
share
how
to
build
political
parties
and
free
elections
how
to
ensure
peaceful
transfers
of
power
how
to
navigate
the
winding
paths
of
reform
and
reconciliation
and
when
the
inevitable
setbacks
occur
you
can
remind
people
to
never
lose
sight
of
those
guiding
stars
of
which
spoke
struggle
but
also
hope
security
for
our
citizens
trade
and
development
that
creates
jobs
prosperity
and
clean
energy
future
standing
up
for
democracy
and
human
rights
these
are
the
partnerships
that
we
can
forge
together
here
in
the
but
also
around
the
world
and
if
anyone
doubts
whether
this
region
has
the
capacity
to
meet
these
challenges
they
need
to
only
remember
what
happened
here
in
only
few
months
ago
their
resolve
and
faith
inspired
the
world
need
to
tell
you
the
story
you
know
it
well
but
worth
remembering
how
this
entire
nation
came
together
across
government
civilian
and
military
national
and
local
across
the
private
sector
with
large
companies
and
small
shopkeepers
donating
supplies
and
across
every
segment
of
chilean
society
people
came
together
to
sustain
those
men
down
below
and
their
families
up
at
camp
it
was
miraculous
rescue
it
was
tribute
to
chilean
leadership
and
when
finally
emerged
he
spoke
for
an
entire
nation
when
he
said
am
proud
to
be
yet
something
else
happened
in
those
two
months
the
people
and
governments
of
latin
america
came
together
to
stand
with
in
need
and
with
latin
american
country
in
the
lead
the
world
was
proud
to
play
supporting
role
sending
workers
from
the
united
states
and
canada
rescue
equipment
from
europe
communications
gear
from
asia
and
as
the
miners
were
lifted
to
safety
for
those
joyous
reunions
it
was
truly
global
movement
watched
and
celebrated
by
more
than
billion
people
if
ever
we
needed
reminder
of
the
humanity
and
the
hopes
that
we
share
that
moment
in
the
desert
was
such
when
country
like
puts
its
mind
to
it
nothing
you
do
when
countries
across
latin
america
come
together
and
focus
on
common
goal
when
the
united
states
and
others
in
the
world
do
our
part
nothing
we
accomplish
together
and
that
is
our
vision
of
the
this
is
the
progress
we
can
achieve
together
this
is
the
spirit
of
partnership
and
equality
to
which
the
united
states
is
committed
am
confident
that
working
together
there
is
nothing
we
can
not
achieve
thank
you
very
much
president
hello
audience
hello
audience
member
many
welcomes
president
boa
since
the
moment
we
arrived
the
people
of
this
nation
have
graciously
shown
my
family
the
warmth
and
generosity
of
the
spirit
thank
you
and
want
to
give
special
thanks
to
all
of
you
for
being
here
because
been
told
that
football
game
coming
so
know
that
give
up
their
soccer
very
easily
now
one
of
my
earliest
impressions
of
brazil
was
movie
saw
with
my
mother
as
very
young
child
movie
called
black
orpheus
that
is
set
in
the
of
during
carnival
and
my
mother
loved
that
movie
with
its
singing
and
dancing
against
the
backdrop
of
the
beautiful
green
hills
and
it
first
premiered
as
play
right
here
in
municipal
that
my
understanding
and
my
mother
is
gone
now
but
she
would
have
never
imagined
that
her
first
trip
to
brazil
would
be
as
president
of
the
united
states
she
would
have
never
imagined
that
and
never
imagined
that
this
country
would
be
even
more
beautiful
than
it
was
in
the
movie
you
are
as
sang
tropical
country
blessed
by
god
and
beautiful
by
seen
that
beauty
in
the
cascading
hillsides
in
your
endless
miles
of
sand
and
ocean
and
in
the
vibrant
diverse
gatherings
of
who
have
come
here
today
and
we
have
wonderfully
mixed
group
we
have
and
got
men
and
women
from
the
cities
to
the
interior
and
so
many
young
people
here
who
are
the
great
future
of
this
great
nation
now
yesterday
met
with
your
wonderful
new
president
and
talked
about
how
we
can
strengthen
the
partnership
between
our
governments
but
today
want
to
speak
directly
to
the
people
about
how
we
can
strengthen
the
friendship
between
our
nations
come
here
to
share
some
ideas
because
want
to
speak
of
the
values
that
we
share
the
hopes
that
we
have
in
common
and
the
difference
that
we
can
make
together
when
you
think
about
it
the
journeys
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
brazil
began
in
similar
ways
our
lands
are
rich
with
creation
home
to
ancient
and
indigenous
peoples
from
overseas
the
were
discovered
by
men
who
sought
new
world
and
settled
by
pioneers
who
pushed
westward
across
vast
frontiers
we
became
colonies
claimed
by
distant
crowns
but
soon
declared
our
independence
we
then
welcomed
waves
of
immigrants
to
our
shores
and
eventually
after
long
struggle
we
cleansed
the
stain
of
slavery
from
our
land
the
united
states
was
the
first
nation
to
independence
and
set
up
diplomatic
outpost
in
this
country
the
first
head
of
state
to
visit
the
united
states
was
the
leader
of
brazil
in
the
second
world
war
our
brave
men
and
women
fought
for
freedom
and
after
the
war
both
of
our
nations
struggled
to
achieve
the
full
blessings
of
liberty
on
the
streets
of
the
united
states
men
and
women
marched
and
bled
and
some
died
so
that
every
citizen
could
enjoy
the
same
freedoms
and
opportunities
no
matter
what
you
looked
like
no
matter
where
you
came
from
in
brazil
you
fought
against
two
decades
of
dictatorships
for
the
same
right
to
be
heard
the
right
to
be
free
from
fear
free
from
want
and
yet
for
years
democracy
and
development
were
slow
to
take
hold
and
millions
suffered
as
result
but
come
here
today
because
those
days
have
passed
brazil
today
is
flourishing
democracy
place
where
people
are
free
to
speak
their
mind
and
choose
their
leaders
where
poor
kid
from
can
rise
from
the
floors
of
copper
factory
to
the
highest
office
in
brazil
over
the
last
decade
the
progress
made
by
the
people
has
inspired
the
world
more
than
half
of
this
nation
is
now
considered
middle
class
millions
have
been
lifted
from
poverty
for
the
first
time
hope
is
returning
to
places
where
fear
had
long
prevailed
saw
this
today
when
visited
the
city
of
god
it
just
the
new
security
efforts
and
social
programs
and
want
to
congratulate
the
mayor
and
the
governor
for
the
excellent
work
that
doing
but
also
change
in
attitudes
as
one
young
resident
said
have
to
look
at
not
with
pity
but
as
source
of
presidents
and
lawyers
and
doctors
artists
and
people
with
with
each
passing
day
brazil
is
country
with
more
solutions
in
the
global
community
gone
from
relying
on
the
help
of
other
nations
to
now
helping
fight
poverty
and
disease
wherever
they
exist
you
play
an
important
role
in
the
global
institutions
that
protect
our
common
security
and
promote
our
common
prosperity
and
you
will
welcome
the
world
to
your
shores
when
the
world
cup
and
the
olympic
games
come
to
now
you
may
be
aware
that
this
city
was
not
my
first
choice
for
the
summer
olympics
but
if
the
games
could
not
be
held
in
chicago
then
no
place
rather
see
them
than
right
here
in
and
intend
to
come
back
in
to
watch
what
happens
for
so
long
brazil
was
nation
brimming
with
potential
but
held
back
by
politics
both
at
home
and
abroad
for
so
long
you
were
called
country
of
the
future
told
to
wait
for
better
day
that
was
always
just
around
the
corner
that
day
has
finally
come
and
this
is
country
of
the
future
no
more
the
people
of
brazil
should
know
that
the
future
has
arrived
it
is
here
now
and
time
to
seize
it
now
our
countries
have
not
always
agreed
on
everything
and
just
like
many
nations
going
to
have
our
differences
of
opinion
going
forward
but
here
to
tell
you
that
the
american
people
just
success
we
root
for
success
as
you
confront
the
many
challenges
you
still
face
at
home
as
well
as
abroad
let
us
stand
together
not
as
senior
and
junior
partners
but
as
equal
partners
joined
in
spirit
of
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
committed
to
the
progress
that
know
that
we
can
make
together
confident
we
can
do
it
together
we
can
advance
our
common
prosperity
as
two
of
the
largest
economies
we
worked
side
by
side
during
the
financial
crisis
to
restore
growth
and
confidence
and
to
keep
our
economies
growing
we
know
necessary
in
both
of
our
nations
we
need
skilled
educated
workforce
which
is
why
american
and
companies
have
pledged
to
help
increase
student
exchanges
between
our
two
nations
we
need
commitment
to
innovation
and
technology
which
is
why
we
agreed
to
expand
cooperation
between
our
scientists
researchers
and
engineers
we
need
infrastructure
which
is
why
american
companies
want
to
help
you
build
and
prepare
this
city
for
olympic
success
in
global
economy
the
united
states
and
brazil
should
expand
trade
expand
investment
so
that
we
create
new
jobs
and
new
opportunities
in
both
of
our
nations
and
that
why
we
working
to
break
down
barriers
to
doing
business
that
why
we
building
closer
relationships
between
our
workers
and
our
entrepreneurs
together
we
can
also
promote
energy
security
and
protect
our
beautiful
planet
as
two
nations
that
are
committed
to
greener
economies
we
know
that
the
ultimate
solution
to
our
energy
challenges
lies
in
clean
and
renewable
power
and
why
half
the
vehicles
in
this
country
can
run
on
and
most
of
your
electricity
comes
from
also
why
in
the
united
states
new
clean
energy
industry
and
why
the
united
states
and
brazil
are
creating
new
energy
partnerships
to
share
technologies
create
new
jobs
and
leave
our
children
world
that
is
cleaner
and
safer
than
we
found
it
together
our
two
nations
can
also
help
defend
our
security
working
together
to
stop
that
has
destroyed
too
many
lives
in
this
hemisphere
we
seek
the
goal
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
working
together
to
enhance
nuclear
security
across
our
hemisphere
from
africa
to
haiti
we
are
working
side
by
side
to
combat
the
hunger
disease
and
corruption
that
can
rot
society
and
rob
human
beings
of
dignity
and
opportunity
and
as
two
countries
that
have
been
greatly
enriched
by
our
african
heritage
absolutely
vital
that
we
are
working
with
the
continent
of
africa
to
help
lift
it
up
that
is
something
that
we
should
be
committed
to
doing
together
today
both
also
delivering
assistance
and
support
to
the
people
at
their
greatest
hour
of
need
the
ties
that
bind
our
nations
to
japan
are
strong
in
brazil
you
are
home
to
the
largest
population
outside
of
japan
in
the
united
states
we
forged
an
alliance
of
more
than
years
the
people
of
japan
are
some
of
our
closest
friends
and
we
will
pray
with
them
and
stand
with
them
and
rebuild
with
them
until
this
crisis
has
passed
in
these
and
other
efforts
to
promote
peace
and
prosperity
throughout
the
world
the
united
states
and
brazil
are
partners
not
just
because
we
share
history
not
just
because
in
the
same
hemisphere
not
just
because
we
share
ties
of
commerce
and
culture
but
also
because
we
share
certain
enduring
values
and
ideals
we
both
believe
in
the
power
and
promise
of
democracy
we
believe
that
no
other
form
of
government
is
more
effective
at
promoting
growth
and
prosperity
that
reaches
every
human
being
not
just
some
but
all
and
those
who
argue
otherwise
those
who
argue
that
democracy
stands
in
the
way
of
economic
progress
they
must
contend
with
the
example
of
brazil
the
millions
in
this
country
who
have
climbed
from
poverty
into
the
middle
class
they
could
not
do
so
in
closed
economy
controlled
by
the
state
prospering
as
free
people
with
open
markets
and
government
that
answers
to
its
citizens
proving
that
the
goal
of
social
justice
and
social
inclusion
can
be
best
achieved
through
freedom
that
democracy
is
the
greatest
partner
of
human
progress
we
also
believe
that
in
nations
as
big
and
diverse
as
ours
shaped
by
generations
of
immigrants
from
every
race
and
faith
and
background
democracy
offers
the
best
hope
that
every
citizen
is
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
and
that
we
can
resolve
our
differences
peacefully
that
we
find
strength
in
our
diversity
we
know
that
experience
in
the
united
states
we
know
how
important
it
is
to
be
able
to
work
together
even
when
we
often
disagree
understand
that
our
chosen
form
of
government
can
be
slow
and
messy
we
understand
that
democracy
must
be
constantly
strengthened
and
perfected
over
time
we
know
that
different
nations
take
different
paths
to
the
promise
of
democracy
and
we
understand
that
no
one
nation
should
impose
its
will
on
another
but
we
also
know
that
certain
aspirations
shared
by
every
human
being
we
all
seek
to
be
free
we
all
seek
to
be
heard
we
all
yearn
to
live
without
fear
or
discrimination
we
all
yearn
to
choose
how
we
are
governed
and
we
all
want
to
shape
our
own
destiny
these
are
not
american
ideals
or
ideals
these
are
not
western
ideals
these
are
universal
rights
and
we
must
support
them
everywhere
today
we
are
seeing
the
struggle
for
these
rights
unfold
across
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
seen
revolution
born
out
of
yearning
for
basic
human
dignity
in
tunisia
seen
peaceful
protestors
pour
into
square
men
and
women
young
and
old
christian
and
muslim
seen
the
people
of
libya
take
courageous
stand
against
regime
determined
to
its
own
citizens
across
the
region
seen
young
people
rise
up
new
generation
demanding
the
right
to
determine
their
own
future
from
the
beginning
we
have
made
clear
that
the
change
they
seek
must
be
driven
by
their
own
people
but
for
our
two
nations
for
the
united
states
and
brazil
two
nations
who
have
struggled
over
many
generations
to
perfect
our
own
democracies
the
united
states
and
brazil
know
that
the
future
of
the
arab
world
will
be
determined
by
its
people
no
one
can
say
for
certain
how
this
change
will
end
but
do
know
that
change
is
not
something
that
we
should
fear
when
young
people
insist
that
the
currents
of
history
are
on
the
move
the
burdens
of
the
past
can
be
washed
away
when
men
and
women
peacefully
claim
their
human
rights
our
own
common
humanity
is
enhanced
wherever
the
light
of
freedom
is
lit
the
world
becomes
brighter
place
that
is
the
example
of
brazil
that
is
the
example
of
brazil
brazil
country
that
shows
that
dictatorship
can
become
thriving
democracy
brazil
country
that
shows
democracy
delivers
both
freedom
and
opportunity
to
its
people
brazil
country
that
shows
how
call
for
change
that
starts
in
the
streets
can
transform
city
transform
country
transform
world
decades
ago
it
was
directly
outside
of
this
in
square
where
the
call
for
change
was
heard
in
brazil
students
and
artists
and
political
leaders
of
all
stripes
would
gather
with
banners
that
said
with
the
dictatorship
the
people
in
their
democratic
aspirations
would
not
be
fulfilled
until
years
later
but
one
of
the
young
in
that
movement
would
go
on
to
forever
change
the
history
of
this
country
child
of
an
immigrant
her
participation
in
the
movement
led
to
her
arrest
and
her
imprisonment
her
torture
at
the
hands
of
her
own
government
and
so
she
knows
what
like
to
live
without
the
most
basic
human
rights
that
so
many
are
fighting
for
today
but
she
also
knows
what
it
is
to
persevere
she
knows
what
it
is
to
overcome
because
today
that
woman
is
your
president
our
two
nations
face
many
challenges
on
the
road
ahead
we
will
certainly
encounter
many
obstacles
but
in
the
end
it
is
our
history
that
gives
us
hope
for
better
tomorrow
it
is
the
knowledge
that
the
men
and
women
who
came
before
us
have
triumphed
over
greater
trials
than
these
that
we
live
in
places
where
ordinary
people
have
done
extraordinary
things
that
sense
of
possibility
that
sense
of
optimism
that
first
drew
pioneers
to
this
new
world
what
binds
our
nations
together
as
partners
in
this
new
century
why
we
believe
in
the
words
of
paul
one
of
your
most
famous
writers
the
strength
of
our
love
and
our
will
we
can
change
our
destiny
as
well
as
the
destiny
of
many
thank
you
and
may
god
bless
our
two
nations
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
today
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
to
begin
limited
military
action
in
libya
in
support
of
an
international
effort
to
protect
libyan
civilians
that
action
has
now
begun
in
this
effort
the
united
states
is
acting
with
broad
coalition
that
is
committed
to
enforcing
united
nations
security
council
resolution
which
calls
for
the
protection
of
the
libyan
people
that
coalition
met
in
paris
today
to
send
unified
message
and
it
brings
together
many
of
our
european
and
arab
partners
this
is
not
an
outcome
that
the
united
states
or
any
of
our
partners
sought
even
yesterday
the
international
community
offered
the
opportunity
to
pursue
an
immediate
one
that
stopped
the
violence
against
civilians
and
the
advances
of
forces
but
despite
the
hollow
words
of
his
government
he
has
ignored
that
opportunity
his
attacks
on
his
own
people
have
continued
his
forces
have
been
on
the
move
and
the
danger
faced
by
the
people
of
libya
has
grown
am
deeply
aware
of
the
risks
of
any
military
action
no
matter
what
limits
we
place
on
it
want
the
american
people
to
know
that
the
use
of
force
is
not
our
first
choice
and
not
choice
that
make
lightly
but
we
can
not
stand
idly
by
when
tyrant
tells
his
people
that
there
will
be
no
mercy
and
his
forces
step
up
their
assaults
on
cities
like
and
where
innocent
men
and
women
face
brutality
and
death
at
the
hands
of
their
own
government
so
we
must
be
clear
actions
have
consequences
and
the
writ
of
the
international
community
must
be
enforced
that
is
the
cause
of
this
coalition
as
part
of
this
effort
the
united
states
will
contribute
our
unique
capabilities
at
the
front
end
of
the
mission
to
protect
libyan
civilians
and
enable
the
enforcement
of
zone
that
will
be
led
by
our
international
partners
and
as
said
yesterday
we
will
not
repeat
we
will
not
deploy
any
troops
on
the
ground
as
have
great
confidence
in
the
men
and
women
of
our
military
who
will
carry
out
this
mission
they
carry
with
them
the
respect
of
grateful
nation
also
proud
that
we
are
acting
as
part
of
coalition
that
includes
close
allies
and
partners
who
are
prepared
to
meet
their
responsibility
to
protect
the
people
of
libya
and
uphold
the
mandate
of
the
international
community
acted
after
consulting
with
my
national
security
team
and
republican
and
democratic
leaders
of
congress
and
in
the
coming
hours
and
days
my
administration
will
keep
the
american
people
fully
informed
but
make
no
mistake
today
we
are
part
of
broad
coalition
we
are
answering
the
calls
of
threatened
people
and
we
are
acting
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
world
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
update
the
american
people
about
the
situation
in
libya
over
the
last
several
weeks
the
world
has
watched
events
unfold
in
libya
with
hope
and
alarm
last
month
protesters
took
to
the
streets
across
the
country
to
demand
their
universal
rights
and
government
that
is
accountable
to
them
and
responsive
to
their
aspirations
but
they
were
met
with
an
iron
fist
within
days
whole
parts
of
the
country
declared
their
independence
from
brutal
regime
and
members
of
the
government
serving
in
libya
and
abroad
chose
to
align
themselves
with
the
forces
of
change
clearly
lost
the
confidence
of
his
own
people
and
the
legitimacy
to
lead
instead
of
respecting
the
rights
of
his
own
people
chose
the
path
of
brutal
suppression
innocent
civilians
were
beaten
imprisoned
and
in
some
cases
killed
peaceful
protests
were
forcefully
put
down
hospitals
were
attacked
and
patients
disappeared
campaign
of
intimidation
and
repression
began
in
the
face
of
this
injustice
the
united
states
and
the
international
community
moved
swiftly
sanctions
were
put
in
place
by
the
united
states
and
our
allies
and
partners
the
security
council
imposed
further
sanctions
an
arms
embargo
and
the
of
international
accountability
for
and
those
around
him
humanitarian
assistance
was
positioned
on
borders
and
those
displaced
by
the
violence
received
our
help
ample
warning
was
given
that
needed
to
stop
his
campaign
of
repression
or
be
held
accountable
the
arab
league
and
the
european
union
joined
us
in
calling
for
an
end
to
violence
once
again
chose
to
ignore
the
will
of
his
people
and
the
international
community
instead
he
launched
military
campaign
against
his
own
people
and
there
should
be
no
doubt
about
his
intentions
because
he
himself
has
made
them
clear
for
decades
he
has
demonstrated
willingness
to
use
brute
force
through
his
sponsorship
of
terrorism
against
the
american
people
as
well
as
others
and
through
the
killings
that
he
has
carried
out
within
his
own
borders
and
just
yesterday
speaking
of
the
city
of
city
of
roughly
people
he
threatened
and
quote
will
have
no
mercy
and
no
no
mercy
on
his
own
citizens
now
here
is
why
this
matters
to
us
left
unchecked
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
would
commit
atrocities
against
his
people
many
thousands
could
die
humanitarian
crisis
would
ensue
the
entire
region
could
be
endangering
many
of
our
allies
and
partners
the
calls
of
the
libyan
people
for
help
would
go
unanswered
the
democratic
values
that
we
stand
for
would
be
overrun
moreover
the
words
of
the
international
community
would
be
rendered
hollow
and
why
the
united
states
has
worked
with
our
allies
and
partners
to
shape
strong
international
response
at
the
united
nations
our
focus
has
been
clear
protecting
innocent
civilians
within
libya
and
holding
the
regime
accountable
yesterday
in
response
to
call
for
action
by
the
libyan
people
and
the
arab
league
the
security
council
passed
strong
resolution
that
demands
an
end
to
the
violence
against
citizens
it
the
use
of
force
with
an
explicit
commitment
to
pursue
all
necessary
measures
to
stop
the
killing
to
include
the
enforcement
of
zone
over
libya
it
also
strengthens
our
sanctions
and
the
enforcement
of
an
arms
embargo
against
the
regime
now
once
more
has
choice
the
resolution
that
passed
lays
out
very
clear
conditions
that
must
be
met
the
united
states
the
united
kingdom
france
and
arab
states
agree
that
must
be
implemented
immediately
that
means
all
attacks
against
civilians
must
stop
must
stop
his
troops
from
advancing
on
pull
them
back
from
and
and
establish
water
electricity
and
gas
supplies
to
all
areas
humanitarian
assistance
must
be
allowed
to
reach
the
people
of
libya
let
me
be
clear
these
terms
are
not
negotiable
these
terms
are
not
subject
to
negotiation
if
does
not
comply
with
the
resolution
the
international
community
will
impose
consequences
and
the
resolution
will
be
enforced
through
military
action
in
this
effort
the
united
states
is
prepared
to
act
as
part
of
an
international
coalition
american
leadership
is
essential
but
that
does
not
mean
acting
alone
it
means
shaping
the
conditions
for
the
international
community
to
act
together
why
have
directed
secretary
gates
and
our
military
to
coordinate
their
planning
and
tomorrow
secretary
will
travel
to
paris
for
meeting
with
our
european
allies
and
arab
partners
about
the
enforcement
of
resolution
we
will
provide
the
unique
capabilities
that
we
can
bring
to
bear
to
stop
the
violence
against
civilians
including
enabling
our
european
allies
and
arab
partners
to
effectively
enforce
no
fly
zone
have
no
doubt
that
the
men
and
women
of
our
military
are
capable
of
carrying
out
this
mission
once
more
they
have
the
thanks
of
grateful
nation
and
the
admiration
of
the
world
also
want
to
be
clear
about
what
we
will
not
be
doing
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
deploy
ground
troops
into
libya
and
we
are
not
going
to
use
force
to
go
beyond
goal
specifically
the
protection
of
civilians
in
libya
in
the
coming
weeks
we
will
continue
to
help
the
libyan
people
with
humanitarian
and
economic
assistance
so
that
they
can
their
aspirations
peacefully
now
the
united
states
did
not
seek
this
outcome
our
decisions
have
been
driven
by
refusal
to
respect
the
rights
of
his
people
and
the
potential
for
mass
murder
of
innocent
civilians
it
is
not
an
action
that
we
will
pursue
alone
indeed
our
british
and
french
allies
and
members
of
the
arab
league
have
already
committed
to
take
leadership
role
in
the
enforcement
of
this
resolution
just
as
they
were
instrumental
in
pursuing
it
we
are
coordinating
closely
with
them
and
this
is
precisely
how
the
international
community
should
work
as
more
nations
bear
both
the
responsibility
and
the
cost
of
enforcing
international
law
this
is
just
one
more
chapter
in
the
change
that
is
unfolding
across
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
from
the
beginning
of
these
protests
we
have
made
it
clear
that
we
are
opposed
to
violence
we
have
made
clear
our
support
for
set
of
universal
values
and
our
support
for
the
political
and
economic
change
that
the
people
of
the
region
deserve
but
want
to
be
clear
the
change
in
the
region
will
not
and
can
not
be
imposed
by
the
united
states
or
any
foreign
power
ultimately
it
will
be
driven
by
the
people
of
the
arab
world
it
is
their
right
and
their
responsibility
to
determine
their
own
destiny
let
me
close
by
saying
that
there
is
no
decision
face
as
your
commander
in
chief
that
consider
as
carefully
as
the
decision
to
ask
our
men
and
women
to
use
military
force
particularly
at
time
when
our
military
is
fighting
in
and
winding
down
our
activities
in
iraq
that
decision
is
only
made
more
difficult
but
the
united
states
of
america
will
not
stand
idly
by
in
the
face
of
actions
that
undermine
global
peace
and
security
so
have
taken
this
decision
with
the
confidence
that
action
is
necessary
and
that
we
will
not
be
acting
alone
our
goal
is
focused
our
cause
is
just
and
our
coalition
is
strong
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
secretary
and
just
concluded
meeting
that
focused
on
the
ongoing
situation
in
libya
over
the
last
few
days
my
national
security
team
has
been
working
around
the
clock
to
monitor
the
situation
there
and
to
coordinate
with
our
international
partners
about
way
forward
first
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
protect
american
citizens
that
is
my
highest
priority
in
libya
we
urged
our
people
to
leave
the
country
and
the
state
department
is
assisting
those
in
need
of
support
meanwhile
think
all
americans
should
give
thanks
to
the
heroic
work
that
being
done
by
our
foreign
service
officers
and
the
men
and
women
serving
in
our
embassies
and
consulates
around
the
world
they
represent
the
very
best
of
our
country
and
its
values
now
throughout
this
period
of
unrest
and
upheaval
across
the
region
the
united
states
has
maintained
set
of
core
principles
which
guide
our
approach
these
principles
apply
to
the
situation
in
libya
as
said
last
week
we
strongly
condemn
the
use
of
violence
in
libya
the
american
people
extend
our
deepest
condolences
to
the
families
and
loved
ones
of
all
been
killed
and
injured
the
suffering
and
bloodshed
is
outrageous
and
it
is
unacceptable
so
are
threats
and
orders
to
shoot
peaceful
protesters
and
further
punish
the
people
of
libya
these
actions
violate
international
norms
and
every
standard
of
common
decency
this
violence
must
stop
the
united
states
also
strongly
supports
the
universal
rights
of
the
libyan
people
that
includes
the
rights
of
peaceful
assembly
free
and
the
ability
of
the
libyan
people
to
determine
their
own
destiny
these
are
human
rights
they
are
not
negotiable
they
must
be
respected
in
every
country
and
they
can
not
be
denied
through
violence
or
suppression
in
volatile
situation
like
this
one
it
is
imperative
that
the
nations
and
peoples
of
the
world
speak
with
one
voice
and
that
has
been
our
focus
yesterday
unanimous
security
council
sent
clear
message
that
it
condemns
the
violence
in
libya
supports
accountability
for
the
perpetrators
and
stands
with
the
libyan
people
this
same
message
by
the
way
has
been
delivered
by
the
european
union
the
arab
league
the
african
union
the
of
the
islamic
conference
and
many
individual
nations
north
and
south
east
and
west
voices
are
being
raised
together
to
oppose
suppression
and
support
the
rights
of
the
libyan
people
also
asked
my
administration
to
prepare
the
full
range
of
options
that
we
have
to
respond
to
this
crisis
this
includes
those
actions
we
may
take
and
those
we
will
coordinate
with
our
allies
and
partners
or
those
that
carry
out
through
multilateral
institutions
like
all
governments
the
libyan
government
has
responsibility
to
refrain
from
violence
to
allow
humanitarian
assistance
to
reach
those
in
need
and
to
respect
the
rights
of
its
people
it
must
be
held
accountable
for
its
failure
to
meet
those
responsibilities
and
face
the
cost
of
continued
violations
of
human
rights
this
is
not
simply
concern
of
the
united
states
the
entire
world
is
watching
and
we
will
coordinate
our
assistance
and
accountability
measures
with
the
international
community
to
that
end
secretary
and
have
asked
bill
burns
our
under
secretary
of
state
for
political
affairs
to
make
several
stops
in
europe
and
the
region
to
intensify
our
consultations
with
allies
and
partners
about
the
situation
in
libya
also
asked
secretary
to
travel
to
geneva
on
monday
where
number
of
foreign
ministers
will
convene
for
session
of
the
human
rights
council
there
hold
consultations
with
her
counterparts
on
events
throughout
the
region
and
continue
to
ensure
that
we
join
with
the
international
community
to
speak
with
one
voice
to
the
government
and
the
people
of
libya
and
even
as
we
are
focused
on
the
urgent
situation
in
libya
let
me
just
say
that
our
efforts
continue
to
address
the
events
taking
place
elsewhere
including
how
the
international
community
can
most
effectively
support
the
peaceful
transition
to
democracy
in
both
tunisia
and
in
egypt
so
let
me
be
clear
the
change
that
is
taking
place
across
the
region
is
being
driven
by
the
people
of
the
region
this
change
represent
the
work
of
the
united
states
or
any
foreign
power
it
represents
the
aspirations
of
people
who
are
seeking
better
life
as
one
libyan
said
just
want
to
be
able
to
live
like
human
we
just
want
to
be
able
to
live
like
human
beings
it
is
the
most
basic
of
aspirations
that
is
driving
this
change
and
throughout
this
time
of
transition
the
united
states
will
continue
to
stand
up
for
freedom
stand
up
for
justice
and
stand
up
for
the
dignity
of
all
people
thank
you
very
much
there
are
very
few
moments
in
our
lives
where
we
have
the
privilege
to
witness
history
taking
place
this
is
one
of
those
moments
this
is
one
of
those
times
the
people
of
egypt
have
spoken
their
voices
have
been
heard
and
egypt
will
never
be
the
same
by
stepping
down
president
responded
to
the
egyptian
hunger
for
change
but
this
is
not
the
end
of
transition
beginning
sure
there
will
be
difficult
days
ahead
and
many
questions
remain
unanswered
but
am
confident
that
the
people
of
egypt
can
find
the
answers
and
do
so
peacefully
constructively
and
in
the
spirit
of
unity
that
has
defined
these
last
few
weeks
for
have
made
it
clear
that
nothing
less
than
genuine
democracy
will
carry
the
day
the
military
has
served
and
responsibly
as
caretaker
to
the
state
and
will
now
have
to
ensure
transition
that
is
credible
in
the
eyes
of
the
egyptian
people
that
means
protecting
the
rights
of
citizens
lifting
the
emergency
law
revising
the
constitution
and
other
laws
to
make
this
change
irreversible
and
laying
out
clear
path
to
elections
that
are
fair
and
free
above
all
this
transition
must
bring
all
of
voices
to
the
table
for
the
spirit
of
peaceful
protest
and
perseverance
that
the
egyptian
people
have
shown
can
serve
as
powerful
wind
at
the
back
of
this
change
the
united
states
will
continue
to
be
friend
and
partner
to
egypt
we
stand
ready
to
provide
whatever
assistance
is
necessary
and
asked
for
to
pursue
credible
transition
to
democracy
also
confident
that
the
same
ingenuity
and
entrepreneurial
spirit
that
the
young
people
of
egypt
have
shown
in
recent
days
can
be
harnessed
to
create
new
opportunity
jobs
and
businesses
that
allow
the
extraordinary
potential
of
this
generation
to
take
flight
and
know
that
democratic
egypt
can
advance
its
role
of
responsible
leadership
not
only
in
the
region
but
around
the
world
egypt
has
played
pivotal
role
in
human
history
for
over
years
but
over
the
last
few
weeks
the
wheel
of
history
turned
at
blinding
pace
as
the
egyptian
people
demanded
their
universal
rights
we
saw
mothers
and
fathers
carrying
their
children
on
their
shoulders
to
show
them
what
true
freedom
might
look
like
we
saw
young
egyptian
say
the
first
time
in
my
life
really
count
my
voice
is
heard
even
though
only
one
person
this
is
the
way
real
democracy
we
saw
protesters
chant
are
again
and
again
we
saw
military
that
would
not
fire
bullets
at
the
people
they
were
sworn
to
protect
and
we
saw
doctors
and
nurses
rushing
into
the
streets
to
care
for
those
who
were
wounded
volunteers
checking
protesters
to
ensure
that
they
were
unarmed
we
saw
people
of
faith
praying
together
and
chanting
we
are
and
though
we
know
that
the
strains
between
faiths
still
divide
too
many
in
this
world
and
no
single
event
will
close
that
chasm
immediately
these
scenes
remind
us
that
we
need
not
be
defined
by
our
differences
we
can
be
defined
by
the
common
humanity
that
we
share
and
above
all
we
saw
new
generation
emerge
generation
that
uses
their
own
creativity
and
talent
and
technology
to
call
for
government
that
represented
their
hopes
and
not
their
fears
government
that
is
responsive
to
their
boundless
aspirations
one
egyptian
put
it
simply
most
people
have
discovered
in
the
last
few
they
are
worth
something
and
this
can
not
be
taken
away
from
them
anymore
ever
this
is
the
power
of
human
dignity
and
it
can
never
be
denied
have
inspired
us
and
done
so
by
putting
the
lie
to
the
idea
that
justice
is
best
gained
through
violence
for
in
egypt
it
was
the
moral
force
of
nonviolence
not
terrorism
not
mindless
killing
but
nonviolence
moral
force
that
bent
the
arc
of
history
toward
justice
once
more
and
while
the
sights
and
sounds
that
we
heard
were
entirely
egyptian
we
help
but
hear
the
of
history
from
germans
tearing
down
wall
students
taking
to
the
streets
gandhi
leading
his
people
down
the
path
of
justice
as
martin
luther
king
said
in
celebrating
the
birth
of
new
nation
in
ghana
while
trying
to
perfect
his
own
is
something
in
the
soul
that
cries
out
for
those
were
the
cries
that
came
from
square
and
the
entire
world
has
taken
note
today
belongs
to
the
people
of
egypt
and
the
american
people
are
moved
by
these
scenes
in
cairo
and
across
egypt
because
of
who
we
are
as
people
and
the
kind
of
world
that
we
want
our
children
to
grow
up
in
the
word
means
liberation
it
is
word
that
speaks
to
that
something
in
our
souls
that
cries
out
for
freedom
and
it
will
remind
us
of
the
egyptian
people
of
what
they
did
of
the
things
that
they
stood
for
and
how
they
changed
their
country
and
in
doing
so
changed
the
world
thank
you
it
is
wonderful
to
be
here
in
the
upper
peninsula
with
so
many
how
many
of
you
are
green
bay
fans
too
been
seeing
too
many
green
bay
fans
lately
it
is
great
to
be
here
it
is
great
to
be
at
northern
michigan
university
got
some
wonderful
guests
here
that
just
want
to
mention
first
of
all
somebody
who
is
as
good
public
servant
not
just
good
at
what
he
does
but
good
at
heart
and
works
tirelessly
on
behalf
of
the
entire
state
your
senior
senator
is
here
now
his
partner
in
the
senate
could
not
be
here
because
actually
leading
democratic
caucus
retreat
but
been
fighting
for
manufacturing
for
broadband
for
lot
of
things
that
talking
about
here
today
so
just
want
to
acknowledge
who
deeply
cares
about
the
work
that
you
do
up
here
want
to
thank
the
great
hospitality
of
mayor
john
who
has
been
showing
me
around
town
thank
you
so
much
mayor
the
president
of
northern
michigan
university
is
here
and
all
of
you
are
here
and
you
guys
are
pretty
special
absolutely
before
begin
just
want
to
say
that
we
are
following
events
in
egypt
very
closely
and
have
more
to
say
as
this
plays
out
but
what
is
absolutely
clear
is
that
we
are
witnessing
history
unfold
moment
of
transformation
taking
place
because
the
people
of
egypt
are
calling
for
change
and
turned
out
in
extraordinary
numbers
representing
all
ages
and
all
walks
of
life
but
young
people
been
at
the
forefront
new
generation
your
generation
who
want
their
voices
to
be
heard
and
so
going
forward
we
want
those
young
people
and
we
want
all
to
know
america
will
continue
to
do
everything
that
we
can
to
support
an
orderly
and
genuine
transition
to
democracy
in
egypt
now
as
we
watch
taking
place
also
reminded
that
we
live
in
an
interconnected
world
what
happens
across
the
globe
has
an
impact
on
each
and
every
one
of
us
and
why
come
to
today
not
only
because
beautiful
and
the
people
are
really
nice
which
is
true
but
come
here
because
in
the
century
not
just
the
big
cities
where
change
is
happening
also
in
towns
like
this
where
the
jobs
and
businesses
of
tomorrow
will
take
root
and
where
young
and
talented
americans
can
lead
towns
like
this
where
our
economic
future
will
be
won
now
in
the
short
term
the
best
thing
we
can
do
to
speed
up
economic
growth
is
to
make
sure
families
and
businesses
have
more
money
to
spend
and
exactly
what
got
little
applause
there
exactly
why
we
passed
those
tax
cuts
in
december
what
doing
because
democrats
and
republicans
came
together
will
be
little
bigger
this
year
and
businesses
will
be
able
to
write
off
their
investments
and
companies
will
grow
and
add
workers
but
got
more
to
do
our
measure
of
success
has
to
be
whether
every
american
who
wants
job
can
find
job
whether
this
country
is
still
the
place
where
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
in
world
more
connected
and
more
competitive
other
nations
look
at
this
moment
as
their
moment
their
turn
to
win
the
jobs
and
industries
of
our
time
see
things
differently
see
this
as
moment
to
win
the
future
so
that
the
century
is
the
american
century
just
like
the
century
was
yes
we
can
but
to
do
this
going
to
have
to
up
our
game
we
got
to
up
our
game
to
attract
the
best
jobs
the
newest
industries
going
to
have
to
going
to
have
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
means
investing
in
research
and
technology
like
the
new
advanced
battery
manufacturing
industry
taking
root
right
here
in
the
state
of
michigan
it
means
investing
in
the
skills
and
training
of
our
people
just
like
taking
place
at
this
university
it
means
investing
in
transportation
and
communications
networks
that
move
goods
and
information
as
fast
as
possible
and
to
make
room
for
these
investments
going
to
have
to
cut
whatever
spending
we
can
do
without
got
real
issue
with
debts
and
deficit
and
so
got
to
live
within
our
means
and
that
means
that
got
to
cut
out
things
that
adding
to
growth
and
opportunity
in
order
to
invest
in
those
things
that
are
and
why
proposed
that
we
freeze
annual
domestic
spending
for
the
next
five
years
that
will
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
billion
dollars
over
the
next
decade
it
will
bring
spending
to
the
lowest
share
of
our
economy
since
was
president
long
time
ago
even
born
then
so
government
has
to
do
what
american
families
do
every
day
live
within
our
means
but
even
as
we
do
so
we
sacrifice
our
future
just
give
you
guys
an
analogy
if
trying
to
cut
back
in
your
family
you
might
decide
not
going
to
go
out
to
dinner
so
often
maybe
skip
the
vacation
not
going
to
remodel
the
kitchen
but
you
stop
saving
for
your
college
education
you
stop
saving
for
your
own
retirement
if
your
boiler
was
broken
or
your
roof
had
leak
still
go
ahead
and
make
those
investments
well
the
same
is
true
with
our
country
got
to
cut
out
the
equivalence
of
eating
out
and
vacations
know
there
may
be
some
restaurant
owners
here
go
eat
at
their
restaurants
but
just
making
general
point
even
as
we
cut
out
the
things
we
can
afford
to
do
without
we
got
responsibility
to
invest
in
those
areas
that
will
have
the
biggest
impact
on
our
future
and
those
things
are
innovation
education
and
infrastructure
and
that
last
area
infrastructure
is
why
come
here
today
connecting
country
of
our
size
has
never
been
easy
just
imagine
what
americans
experienced
when
they
fanned
out
from
colonies
to
settle
continent
if
you
wanted
to
get
from
one
coast
to
the
other
it
would
take
you
months
it
would
cost
you
small
fortune
if
you
settled
in
the
heartland
you
were
an
island
with
no
real
market
to
sell
your
goods
or
buy
what
you
needed
you
might
have
to
wait
until
the
traders
came
by
before
you
stocked
up
so
we
decided
to
build
railroad
to
span
continent
one
that
would
blast
through
mountains
of
granite
and
use
thousands
of
miles
of
steel
and
put
to
work
an
army
of
citizens
and
immigrants
to
work
it
was
an
that
would
also
require
support
of
our
government
it
just
happen
on
its
own
as
general
said
sam
is
the
only
giant
know
who
can
grapple
the
so
even
as
president
lincoln
tried
to
hold
the
north
and
south
together
he
was
determined
to
see
this
railroad
unite
east
and
west
and
private
companies
joined
the
charge
racing
one
another
to
meet
in
the
middle
and
eventually
telephone
operator
telegraph
operator
sent
out
simple
message
to
the
cheers
of
waiting
nation
the
telegraph
just
said
done
now
if
he
knew
that
we
were
still
talking
about
it
today
he
might
have
come
up
with
something
more
inspiring
but
overnight
the
transcontinental
railroad
laid
the
way
for
nationwide
economy
not
bunch
of
local
economies
but
nationwide
economy
suddenly
trip
was
cut
from
months
to
days
the
cost
to
move
goods
and
mail
plummeted
cowboys
drove
cattle
to
that
whisked
them
back
east
entrepreneurs
could
sell
anything
anywhere
after
the
railroad
was
completed
newspaper
proclaimed
are
the
youngest
of
peoples
but
we
are
teaching
the
world
to
march
teaching
the
world
to
march
forward
who
we
are
we
are
nation
that
has
always
been
built
to
compete
and
why
decades
later
set
up
the
rural
electrification
administration
to
help
bring
power
to
vast
of
america
that
were
still
in
darkness
companies
said
that
building
lines
to
rural
areas
would
be
too
costly
mean
big
cities
already
had
electricity
but
they
said
too
costly
to
go
out
into
remote
areas
too
costly
to
come
up
into
the
upper
peninsula
so
americans
in
these
towns
went
without
refrigeration
or
running
water
if
you
wanted
glimpse
of
the
larger
world
your
town
might
run
movie
off
small
diesel
engine
it
might
not
even
last
the
full
film
once
power
lines
were
laid
down
electricity
flowed
to
farms
across
the
country
transforming
millions
of
lives
story
of
texas
family
returning
home
the
first
night
their
farmhouse
was
hooked
up
and
woman
thought
it
was
on
fire
and
her
daughter
said
mama
the
lights
are
think
about
that
that
that
long
ago
and
government
was
there
to
help
make
sure
that
everybody
everybody
not
just
some
but
everybody
not
just
those
who
folks
could
make
an
immediate
profit
off
of
but
everybody
had
access
to
electricity
so
years
later
as
our
nation
grew
by
leaps
and
bounds
we
that
patchwork
system
of
back
roads
and
dirt
paths
handle
the
biggest
economy
in
the
world
so
president
helped
make
it
possible
to
build
an
highway
system
and
that
too
transformed
the
nation
as
much
as
the
railways
had
and
finally
we
could
ship
goods
and
services
to
places
that
the
reach
it
meant
that
we
could
live
apart
from
where
we
worked
we
could
travel
we
could
see
america
each
of
these
achievements
none
of
them
just
happened
we
chose
to
do
them
we
chose
to
do
big
things
and
every
american
benefited
not
just
from
new
conveniences
not
just
from
the
jobs
created
by
laying
down
new
lines
or
tracks
or
pavement
we
benefited
enormously
from
new
economic
growth
from
the
scores
of
businesses
that
opened
near
each
new
train
station
or
new
power
line
or
new
so
this
is
new
century
and
we
expect
economy
to
take
root
using
infrastructure
we
got
to
think
about
the
next
thing
the
next
big
thing
and
make
sure
that
at
the
forefront
just
like
we
were
in
the
last
century
today
new
companies
are
going
to
seek
out
the
fastest
most
reliable
ways
to
move
people
goods
and
information
whether
they
are
in
or
in
chicago
so
if
we
want
new
jobs
and
businesses
here
in
america
got
to
have
the
best
transportation
system
and
the
best
communication
network
in
the
world
like
that
movie
field
of
dreams
if
we
build
it
they
will
come
but
got
to
build
it
got
to
build
it
over
the
last
two
years
begun
rebuilding
for
the
century
this
is
national
project
that
has
meant
thousands
of
jobs
for
the
construction
industry
and
now
proposed
redoubling
these
efforts
we
want
to
put
more
americans
to
work
repairing
crumbling
bridges
and
roads
within
years
our
goal
is
to
have
percent
of
americans
with
access
to
rail
which
could
allow
you
to
go
to
places
in
half
the
time
it
takes
by
car
within
five
years
we
want
to
make
it
possible
for
businesses
to
put
wireless
services
in
reach
of
virtually
every
american
and
that
last
part
wireless
is
why
chose
to
come
to
northern
michigan
university
today
now
let
me
give
you
some
context
today
more
than
percent
of
homes
in
south
korea
subscribe
to
broadband
they
just
have
better
networks
than
we
do
in
america
the
nation
that
created
the
internet
by
the
way
because
of
government
investment
it
just
happen
by
itself
magically
because
of
government
we
created
the
internet
but
yet
only
percent
of
households
here
in
america
can
say
the
same
when
it
comes
to
internet
the
lights
are
still
off
in
of
our
households
one
out
of
every
three
households
in
america
have
that
same
access
for
millions
of
americans
the
railway
showed
up
yet
for
our
families
and
our
businesses
wireless
service
the
next
train
station
the
next
how
spark
new
innovation
new
investment
new
jobs
and
you
know
this
here
in
northern
michigan
why
showed
up
in
addition
to
it
being
pretty
and
people
being
nice
for
decades
now
this
university
has
given
new
laptop
to
every
incoming
student
stretched
across
campus
but
if
you
lived
like
most
students
and
teachers
here
you
were
largely
out
of
luck
broadband
was
often
too
expensive
to
afford
and
if
you
lived
bit
further
out
of
town
you
were
completely
out
of
luck
because
broadband
providers
they
often
build
networks
where
not
profitable
just
like
they
build
electrical
lines
where
it
profitable
so
this
university
tried
something
new
you
partnered
with
various
companies
to
build
wireless
network
and
you
managed
to
install
it
with
six
people
in
only
four
days
without
raising
tuition
good
job
good
job
president
by
the
way
if
you
give
me
the
name
of
these
six
people
whole
bunch
of
stuff
in
washington
like
to
see
done
in
four
days
with
six
people
so
today
this
is
one
of
most
connected
universities
and
is
near
the
highest
been
in
years
and
more
and
this
is
what
makes
this
special
you
told
nearby
towns
that
if
they
allowed
you
to
retrofit
their
towers
with
new
equipment
to
expand
your
network
then
their
schools
their
first
responders
their
city
governments
could
use
it
too
and
as
result
police
officers
can
access
crime
databases
in
their
cars
and
firefighters
can
download
blueprints
on
the
way
to
burning
building
and
public
works
officials
can
save
money
by
monitoring
pumps
and
equipment
remotely
and
created
new
learning
opportunities
for
students
as
far
as
miles
away
some
of
whom
some
of
whom
always
make
it
to
school
in
place
that
averages
inches
of
snow
year
now
some
of
these
students
appreciate
the
end
of
school
snow
days
know
and
get
really
excited
about
school
snow
days
of
course
in
washington
things
shut
down
when
an
inch
of
snow
but
this
technology
is
giving
them
more
opportunity
good
for
their
education
good
for
our
economy
in
fact
just
came
from
demonstration
of
learning
in
action
we
were
with
professor
and
he
had
plugged
in
high
school
and
township
school
in
big
bay
so
felt
like
the
guy
in
star
trek
was
being
beamed
around
across
the
upper
peninsula
here
but
it
was
remarkable
to
see
the
possibilities
for
these
young
people
who
are
able
to
say
do
chemistry
experiment
and
they
can
compare
the
results
with
kids
in
boston
or
if
some
learning
tool
or
material
they
have
immediately
accessible
in
their
school
they
can
connect
here
to
the
university
and
able
to
tap
into
it
opening
up
an
entire
world
to
them
and
one
of
the
young
people
who
was
talking
to
he
talked
about
foreign
policy
and
what
we
were
seeing
in
places
like
egyptian
and
he
said
amazing
especially
for
us
is
that
now
we
have
window
to
the
entire
world
and
we
can
start
understanding
other
cultures
and
other
places
in
ways
that
we
could
never
do
without
this
technology
for
local
businesses
broadband
access
is
helping
them
grow
and
prosper
and
compete
in
global
economy
in
fact
has
been
rated
one
of
the
top
five
in
michigan
for
entrepreneurship
right
so
great
example
clothiers
the
are
here
where
are
the
around
here
somewhere
there
they
are
right
there
this
is
institution
occupied
the
same
store
for
more
than
century
but
with
the
help
of
broadband
they
were
recently
listed
as
one
of
companies
now
how
did
they
pull
that
off
obviously
got
great
products
great
service
but
also
true
is
sales
now
make
up
more
than
of
their
annual
revenue
think
about
that
you
got
department
store
now
of
its
sales
are
it
can
process
more
than
orders
day
and
its
workforce
has
more
than
doubled
so
got
local
business
with
global
footprint
because
of
technology
now
if
you
can
do
this
in
snowy
we
can
do
it
all
across
america
in
fact
many
places
already
are
so
in
south
patients
can
receive
lifesaving
medical
care
from
falls
specialist
who
can
monitor
their
and
listen
to
their
breathing
from
miles
away
in
ten
sleep
love
the
name
of
that
town
ten
sleep
town
in
of
people
network
allowed
company
to
employ
several
hundred
teachers
who
teach
english
to
students
in
asia
over
the
internet
hours
day
all
heard
about
outsourcing
well
this
is
where
overseas
work
is
done
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
so
we
want
to
multiply
these
stories
we
want
to
multiply
your
story
all
over
the
country
we
want
to
invest
in
the
next
generation
of
wireless
coverage
for
percent
of
americans
this
just
about
faster
internet
or
being
able
to
find
friend
on
about
connecting
every
corner
of
america
to
the
digital
age
about
rural
community
in
or
alabama
where
farmers
can
monitor
weather
across
the
state
and
market
across
the
globe
about
an
entrepreneur
on
main
street
with
great
idea
she
hopes
to
sell
to
the
big
city
about
every
young
person
who
no
longer
has
to
leave
his
to
seek
new
opportunity
because
opportunity
is
right
there
at
his
or
her
fingertips
so
to
make
this
happen
going
to
invest
in
research
and
development
of
emerging
technologies
and
applications
going
to
accelerate
breakthroughs
in
health
and
education
and
transportation
and
deploy
new
nationwide
interoperable
wireless
network
for
first
responders
making
sure
got
the
funding
and
the
frequencies
that
they
were
promised
and
that
they
need
to
keep
us
safe
important
by
selling
private
companies
the
rights
to
these
airwaves
we
just
encourage
private
investment
and
expand
wireless
access
actually
going
to
bring
in
revenues
that
lower
our
deficits
now
access
to
internet
by
itself
make
business
more
successful
or
student
smarter
or
citizen
more
informed
that
takes
hard
work
it
takes
those
late
nights
it
takes
hustle
it
takes
that
quintessentially
american
drive
to
be
the
best
the
most
important
ingredient
for
our
success
but
always
believed
that
we
have
responsibility
to
guarantee
all
our
people
every
tool
necessary
for
them
to
meet
their
full
potential
so
if
willing
to
work
hard
they
can
succeed
and
in
economy
that
has
never
been
more
important
every
american
deserves
access
to
the
information
every
american
deserves
access
to
the
global
economy
we
have
promised
this
for
years
time
we
delivered
on
that
promise
time
we
delivered
on
that
promise
so
connecting
our
people
competing
with
the
rest
of
the
world
living
within
our
means
without
sacrificing
required
to
win
the
future
we
can
do
all
this
because
done
it
before
in
at
the
height
of
his
presidential
campaign
came
to
michigan
and
it
was
moment
similar
to
this
one
other
nations
were
doing
their
best
to
try
to
take
our
place
at
the
top
and
here
in
michigan
he
made
it
clear
that
if
we
wanted
to
keep
from
being
knocked
off
our
perch
there
could
only
be
one
goal
for
the
united
states
it
could
be
summed
up
in
one
word
first
do
not
mean
first
but
he
said
mean
first
when
mean
first
if
mean
first
and
real
question
now
he
continued
real
question
he
continued
whether
up
to
the
task
whether
each
and
every
one
of
us
is
willing
to
face
the
facts
to
bear
the
burdens
to
provide
the
risks
and
to
meet
our
that
was
years
ago
but
things
changed
in
terms
of
required
to
succeed
and
we
were
up
to
the
task
then
believe
up
to
the
task
today
time
and
again
whether
westward
or
skyward
with
each
rail
and
road
that
laid
in
every
community
connected
with
our
own
science
and
imagination
and
we
forged
anew
our
faith
that
we
can
do
anything
we
do
big
things
who
we
are
and
who
going
to
have
to
be
again
young
nation
that
teaches
the
world
to
march
forward
what
doing
up
here
in
what
doing
here
at
northern
michigan
university
what
all
going
to
do
together
in
the
months
and
years
to
come
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
for
the
gracious
introduction
want
to
make
few
other
acknowledgments
to
bell

chamber
board
president
thank
you
for
helping
to
this
there
are
some
members
of
my
administration
want
to
make
sure
are
introduced
my
chief
of
staff
bill
is
here
senior
who
is
interfacing
with
many
of
you
and
has
gotten
terrific
advice
from
many
of
you
is
here
as
well
secretary
ray
our
transportation
secretary
ambassador
kirk
who
is
working
hard
to
get
trade
deals
around
the
world
our
small
business
administration
administrator
mills
my
director
of
the
national
economic
council

is
here
and
also
want
to
make
mention
our
bank
chairman
the
overseas
private
investment

and
also
want
to
acknowledge
good
friend
paul
the
outgoing
chair
of
the
president
economic
recovery
advisory
board
thank
you
all
for
being
here
now
it
is
good
to
be
here
today
at
the
chamber
of
commerce
here
in
the
interest
of
being
more
strolled
over
from
across
the
street
and
look
maybe
if
we
had
brought
over
fruitcake
when
first
moved
in
we
would
have
gotten
off
to
better
start
but
going
to
make
up
for
it
the
truth
is
this
is
the
first
time
been
to
the
chamber
or
the
first
time
that
we
exchanged
ideas
over
the
last
two
years
sought
advice
from
many
of
you
as
we
were
grappling
with
the
worst
recession
most
of
us
have
ever
known
it
recession
that
led
to
some
very
difficult
decisions
for
many
of
you
that
meant
restructuring
and
branch
closings
and
layoffs
that
know
were
very
painful
to
make
for
my
administration
it
meant
series
of
emergency
measures
that
would
not
have
undertaken
under
normal
circumstances
but
that
were
necessary
to
stop
our
economy
from
falling
off
cliff
now
on
some
issues
like
the
recovery
act
we
found
common
cause
on
other
issues
we
had
some
pretty
strong
disagreements
but
here
today
because
am
convinced
as
mentioned
in
his
introduction
that
we
can
and
we
must
work
together
whatever
differences
we
may
have
know
that
all
of
us
share
deep
abiding
belief
in
this
country
belief
in
our
people
belief
in
the
principles
that
have
made
america
economy
the
envy
of
the
world
america
success
did
happen
overnight
and
it
did
happen
by
accident
it
happened
because
of
the
freedom
that
has
allowed
good
ideas
to
flourish
that
has
allowed
capitalism
to
thrive
it
happened
because
of
the
conviction
that
in
this
country
hard
work
should
be
rewarded
and
that
opportunity
should
be
there
for
anybody
who
willing
to
reach
for
it
and
because
it
happened
at
every
juncture
in
our
history
not
just
once
not
just
twice
but
over
and
over
again
we
came
together
to
remake
ourselves
we
came
together
as
one
nation
and
did
what
was
necessary
to
win
the
future
that
is
why
am
so
confident
that
we
will
win
the
future
again
that
the
challenge
that
we
face
today
we
still
have
by
far
the
world
largest
and
most
vibrant
economy
we
have
the
most
productive
workers
the
finest
universities
and
the
markets
the
men
and
women
in
this
room
are
living
testimony
that
american
industry
is
still
the
source
of
the
most
dynamic
companies
and
the
most
ingenious
entrepreneurs
but
we
also
know
that
with
the
march
of
technology
over
the
last
few
decades
the
competition
for
jobs
and
businesses
has
grown
fierce
the
of
our
economy
means
that
businesses
can
now
open
up
shop
employ
workers
and
produce
their
goods
wherever
an
internet
connection
exists
tasks
that
were
once
done
by
workers
can
now
be
done
by
or
in
some
cases
even
and
the
truth
is
as
countries
like
china
and
india
and
brazil
grow
and
develop
larger
middle
classes
it
profitable
for
global
companies
to
aggressively
pursue
these
markets
and
at
times
to
set
up
facilities
in
these
countries
these
forces
are
as
unstoppable
as
they
are
powerful
but
combined
with
brutal
and
devastating
recession
these
forces
have
also
shaken
the
faith
of
the
american
people
in
the
institutions
of
business
and
government
they
see
widening
chasm
of
wealth
and
opportunity
in
this
country
and
they
wonder
if
the
american
dream
is
slipping
away
they
wonder
if
the
middle
class
rather
than
expanding
as
it
has
through
our
lifetimes
is
in
the
midst
of
an
inexorable
contraction
and
we
ignore
these
concerns
we
have
to
renew
people
faith
in
the
promise
of
this
country
that
this
is
place
where
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
and
we
have
to
do
this
together
business
and
government
workers
and
democrats
and
republicans
we
know
what
it
will
take
for
america
to
win
the
future
we
need
to
we
need
to
we
need
to
our
competitors
we
need
an
economy
that
based
not
on
what
we
consume
and
borrow
from
other
nations
but
what
we
make
and
what
we
sell
around
the
world
we
need
to
make
america
the
best
place
on
earth
to
do
business
and
this
is
job
for
all
of
us
as
government
we
will
help
lay
the
foundation
for
you
to
grow
and
innovate
and
succeed
we
will
upgrade
our
transportation
and
communication
networks
so
you
can
move
goods
and
information
more
quickly
and
more
cheaply
we
invest
in
education
so
that
you
can
hire
the
most
skilled
talented
workers
in
the
world
and
we
work
to
knock
down
barriers
that
make
it
harder
for
you
to
compete
from
the
tax
code
to
the
regulatory
system
but
want
to
be
clear
even
as
we
make
america
the
best
place
on
earth
to
do
business
businesses
also
have
responsibility
to
america
understand
the
challenges
you
face
understand
you
are
under
incredible
pressure
to
cut
costs
and
keep
your
margins
up
understand
the
significance
of
your
obligations
to
your
shareholders
and
the
pressures
that
are
created
by
quarterly
reports
get
it
but
as
we
work
with
you
to
make
america
better
place
to
do
business
hoping
that
all
of
you
are
thinking
what
you
can
do
for
america
ask
yourselves
what
you
can
do
to
hire
more
american
workers
what
you
can
do
to
support
the
american
economy
and
invest
in
this
nation
that
what
want
to
talk
about
today
the
responsibilities
we
all
have
the
mutual
responsibilities
we
have
to
secure
the
future
that
we
all
share
now
as
country
we
have
responsibility
to
encourage
american
innovation
talked
about
this
quite
bit
at
my
state
of
the
union
companies
like
yours
have
always
driven
the
discovery
of
new
products
and
new
ideas
you
do
it
better
than
anybody
but
what
you
also
know
is
that
it
not
always
profitable
to
in
the
at
least
for
you
to
invest
in
basic
research
it
very
expensive
and
the
are
not
always
clear
and
they
not
always
and
that
why
government
has
traditionally
helped
invest
in
this
kind
of
science
planting
the
seeds
that
ultimately
grew
into
technologies
from
the
computer
chips
to
the
internet
that
why
we
making
investments
today
in
the
next
generation
of
big
ideas
in
biotechnology
in
information
technology
and
in
clean
energy
technology
we
reforming
our
patent
system
so
innovations
can
move
more
quickly
to
market
case
is
heading
up
new
partnership
called
startup
america
to
help
entrepreneurs
turn
new
ideas
into
new
businesses
and
new
jobs
and
also
proposed
bigger
permanent
tax
credit
for
all
the
research
and
development
your
companies
do
in
this
country
believe
that
is
priority
we
also
have
responsibility
as
nation
to
provide
our
people
with
and
our
businesses
with
the
fastest
most
reliable
way
to
move
goods
and
information
the
costs
to
business
from
outdated
and
inadequate
infrastructure
is
enormous
and
that
what
we
have
right
now
outdated
inadequate
infrastructure
and
any
of
you
that
have
been
to
other
countries
you
know
it
you
see
it
and
it
affects
your
bottom
lines
that
why
want
to
put
more
people
to
work
rebuilding
crumbling
roads
rebuilding
our
bridges
that
why
proposed
connecting
percent
of
the
country
with
to
rail
and
making
it
possible
for
companies
to
put
internet
coverage
in
the
reach
of
virtually
all
americans
you
understand
the
importance
of
this
the
fact
is
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
do
agree
on
whole
lot
and
are
not
friends
well
maybe
do
think
you
are
anyway
did
check
on
this
but
but
they
agree
on
the
need
to
build
infrastructure
and
want
to
thank
the
chamber
for
pushing
congress
to
make
more
infrastructure
investments
and
to
do
so
in
the
most
way
possible
with
tax
dollars
that
leverage
private
capital
and
with
projects
that
are
determined
not
by
politics
but
by
what
best
for
our
economy
third
responsibility
that
we
have
as
nation
is
to
invest
in
the
skills
and
education
of
our
young
people
if
we
expect
companies
to
do
business
and
hire
in
america
america
needs
pool
of
trained
talented
workers
that
can
anybody
in
the
world
and
that
why
we
reforming
education
that
why
we
training
new
math
and
science
teachers
that
why
we
making
college
more
affordable
and
our
community
college
system
recently
visited
in
which
has
partnered
with
local
community
college
and
while
students
train
for
jobs
available
at
the
nearby
plant
they
earn
and
they
got
their
tuition
covered
and
as
result
young
people
can
find
work
can
fill
positions
and
the
entire
region
has
become
more
attractive
to
businesses
it
for
everybody
and
it
something
we
trying
to
duplicate
across
the
country
now
to
make
room
for
these
investments
in
education
in
innovation
in
infrastructure
government
also
has
responsibility
to
cut
spending
that
we
just
afford
that
why
promised
to
veto
any
bill
that
up
with
that
why
proposed
that
we
freeze
annual
domestic
spending
for
the
next
five
years
understand
what
this
means
this
would
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
billion
over
the
next
decade
and
bring
this
spending
domestic
discretionary
spending
down
to
the
lowest
share
of
our
economy
since
was
president
that
was
long
time
ago
now
it
not
going
to
be
enough
we
going
to
have
to
do
more
because
the
driving
force
on
our
deficits
are
entitlements
spending
and
that
going
to
require
both
parties
to
work
together
because
those
are
some
tough
problems
that
we
going
to
have
to
solve
and
am
eager
to
work
with
both
parties
and
with
the
chamber
to
take
additional
steps
across
the
budget
to
put
our
nation
on
sounder
fiscal
footing
by
stopping
spending
on
things
we
do
need
we
can
make
investments
in
the
things
that
we
do
need
the
same
way
families
do
if
they
got
fiscal
problem
if
they
got
to
tighten
their
belt
they
do
stop
paying
for
to
go
to
college
they
cut
out
things
they
do
need
but
they
still
make
investments
in
the
thing
that
are
going
to
make
sure
we
win
the
future
and
that
what
we
have
to
do
as
country
make
some
smart
choices
tough
choices
but
smart
ones
now
in
addition
to
making
government
more
affordable
we
also
making
it
more
effective
and
more
we
trying
to
run
the
government
little
bit
more
like
you
run
your
business
with
better
technology
and
faster
services
so
in
the
coming
months
my
administration
will
develop
proposal
to
merge
consolidate
and
the
federal
government
in
way
that
best
serves
the
goal
of
more
competitive
america
and
we
want
to
start
with
the
different
agencies
that
deal
with
america
exports
if
we
hope
to
help
our
businesses
sell
more
goods
around
the
world
we
should
ensure
we
all
pulling
in
the
same
direction
and
frankly
with
different
agencies
in
charge
nobody
is
in
charge
so
we
going
to
fix
that
as
an
example
of
how
we
can
make
government
that
more
responsive
to
the
american
people
and
to
american
businesses
which
brings
me
to
the
final
responsibility
of
government
breaking
down
some
of
the
barriers
that
stand
in
the
way
of
your
success
as
far
as
exports
are
concerned
that
means
seeking
new
opportunities
and
opening
new
markets
for
your
goods
and
will
tell
you
will
go
anywhere
to
be
booster
for
american
businesses
american
workers
and
american
products
we
recently
signed
and
do
charge
commission
we
recently
signed
export
deals
with
india
and
china
that
will
support
more
than
jobs
here
in
the
united
states
we
trade
agreement
with
south
korea
that
will
support
at
least
american
jobs
and
by
the
way
it
deal
that
has
unprecedented
support
from
business
and
democrats
and
republicans
that
the
kind
of
deal
that
will
be
looking
for
as
we
pursue
trade
agreements
with
panama
and
as
we
work
to
bring
russia
into
the
international
trading
system
those
are
going
to
be
our
top
priorities
because
we
believe
americans
have
the
best
products
and
the
best
businesses
and
if
we
out
there
selling
and
we
out
there
hustling
there
no
reason
why
we
do
lot
better
than
we
doing
right
now
when
it
comes
to
our
exports
now
another
barrier
government
can
remove
and
hear
lot
about
this
from
many
of
you
is
burdensome
corporate
tax
code
with
one
of
the
highest
rates
in
the
world
you
know
how
it
goes
because
of
various
loopholes
and
that
have
built
up
over
the
years
some
industries
pay
an
average
rate
that
is
four
or
five
times
higher
than
others
companies
are
taxed
heavily
for
making
investments
with
equity
yet
the
tax
code
actually
pays
companies
to
invest
using
leverage
as
result
you
got
too
many
companies
ending
up
making
decisions
based
on
what
their
tax
director
says
instead
of
what
their
engineer
designs
or
what
their
factories
produce
and
that
puts
our
entire
economy
at
disadvantage
we
need
something
smarter
something
simpler
something
fairer
that
why
want
to
lower
the
corporate
rate
and
eliminate
these
loopholes
to
pay
for
it
so
that
it
does
add
dime
to
our
deficit
and
asking
for
your
help
in
this
fight
think
it
can
be
done
which
brings
me
to
the
last
barriers
we
trying
to
remove
and
those
are
outdated
and
unnecessary
regulations
ordered
review
and
if
there
are
rules
on
the
books
that
are
needlessly
stifling
job
creation
and
economic
growth
we
will
fix
them
already
we
dramatically
cutting
down
on
the
paperwork
that
saddles
businesses
with
huge
administrative
costs
we
improving
the
way
evaluates
things
like
medical
devices
to
get
innovative
and
lifesaving
treatments
to
market
faster
and
the
based
on
the
need
for
further
scientific
analysis
delayed
the
greenhouse
gas
permitting
rules
for
biomass
also
ordered
agencies
to
find
ways
to
make
regulations
more
flexible
for
small
businesses
and
we
turned
tangle
of
fuel
economy
regulations
and
pending
lawsuits
into
single
standard
that
will
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
save
consumers
money
at
the
pump
and
give
car
companies
the
certainty
that
they
need
all
negotiated
by
the
various
stakeholders
without
the
need
for
congressional
legislation
but
ultimately
winning
the
future
is
not
just
about
what
the
government
can
do
for
you
to
succeed
it
also
about
what
you
can
do
to
help
america
succeed
so
we
were
just
talking
about
regulations
even
as
we
eliminate
burdensome
regulations
america
businesses
have
responsibility
as
well
to
that
there
are
some
basic
safeguards
some
basic
standards
that
are
necessary
to
protect
the
american
people
from
harm
or
exploitation
not
every
regulation
is
bad
not
every
regulation
is
burdensome
on
business
lot
of
the
regulations
that
are
out
there
are
things
that
all
of
us
welcome
in
our
lives
few
of
us
would
want
to
live
in
society
without
rules
that
keep
our
air
and
water
clean
that
give
consumers
the
confidence
to
do
everything
from
investing
in
financial
markets
to
buying
groceries
and
the
fact
is
when
standards
like
these
have
been
proposed
in
the
past
opponents
have
often
warned
that
they
would
be
an
assault
on
business
and
free
enterprise
we
can
look
at
the
history
in
this
country
early
drug
companies
argued
the
bill
creating
the
would
practically
destroy
the
sale
of
remedies
in
the
united
states
that
did
happen
auto
executives
predicted
that
having
to
install
would
bring
the
downfall
of
their
industry
it
did
happen
the
president
of
the
american
bar
association
denounced
child
laws
as
effort
to
children
that
quote
none
of
these
things
came
to
pass
in
fact
companies
adapt
and
standards
often
spark
competition
and
innovation
was
travelling
when
went
up
to
state
to
look
at
some
clean
energy
hubs
that
have
been
set
up
was
with
my
secretary
of
energy
and
he
won
prize
in
physics
so
when
you
in
conversations
with
him
you
catch
about
one
out
of
every
four
things
he
says
but
he
started
talking
about
energy
efficiency
and
about
refrigerators
and
he
pointed
out
that
the
government
set
modest
targets
couple
decades
ago
to
start
increasing
efficiency
over
time
they
were
well
thought
through
they
were
radical
companies
competed
to
hit
these
markers
and
they
hit
them
every
time
and
then
exceeded
them
and
as
result
typical
fridge
now
costs
half
as
much
and
uses
quarter
of
the
energy
that
it
once
did
and
you
do
have
to
defrost
chipping
at
that
stuff
and
then
putting
the
warm
water
inside
the
freezer
and
all
that
stuff
it
saves
families
and
businesses
billions
of
dollars
so
regulations
did
destroy
the
industry
it
enhanced
it
and
it
made
our
lives
better
if
they
smart
if
they
well
designed
and
that
our
goal
is
to
work
with
you
to
think
through
how
do
we
design
necessary
regulations
in
smart
way
and
get
rid
of
regulations
that
have
outlived
their
usefulness
or
do
work
also
have
to
point
out
the
perils
of
too
much
regulation
are
also
matched
by
the
dangers
of
too
little
and
we
saw
that
in
the
financial
crisis
where
the
absence
of
sound
rules
of
the
road
that
was
good
for
business
even
if
you
were
in
the
financial
sector
it
was
good
for
business
and
that
why
with
the
help
of
paul
who
is
here
today
we
passed
set
of
reforms
the
same
can
be
said
of
health
insurance
reform
we
simply
could
not
continue
to
accept
status
that
made
our
entire
economy
less
competitive
as
we
paid
more
per
person
for
health
care
than
any
other
nation
on
earth
nobody
is
even
close
and
we
could
accept
broken
system
where
insurance
companies
could
drop
people
because
they
got
sick
or
families
went
into
bankruptcy
because
of
medical
bills
know
that
folks
here
have
concerns
about
this
law
and
understand
it
if
you
running
business
right
now
and
you
seeing
these
escalating
health
care
costs
your
instinct
is
if
got
even
more
laws
on
top
of
me
that
going
to
increase
my
costs
even
more
understand
that
suspicion
that
but
the
congressional
watchdogs
at
the
estimate
that
health
care
tax
credits
will
be
worth
nearly
billion
for
small
businesses
over
the
next
decade
billion
directly
to
small
businesses
who
are
doing
the
right
thing
by
their
employees
and
experts
not
just
from
the
government
but
also
those
commissioned
by
the
business
suggest
that
health
insurance
reform
could
ultimately
save
large
employers
anywhere
from
to
per
family
your
employees
and
your
bottom
line
said
in
the
state
of
the
union
and
repeat
here
today
am
willing
and
happy
to
look
at
other
ideas
to
improve
the
law
including
incentives
to
improve
patient
safety
and
medical
malpractice
reforms
and
want
to
correct
flaw
that
already
placed
an
unnecessary
bookkeeping
burden
on
too
many
small
businesses
and
appreciate
the
chamber
help
in
doing
that
but
we
have
to
that
some
regulations
often
will
make
sense
for
your
businesses
as
well
as
your
families
as
well
as
your
as
well
as
your
coworkers
of
course
your
responsibility
goes
beyond
the
need
for
certain
standards
and
safeguards
if
we
fighting
to
reform
the
tax
code
and
increase
exports
to
help
you
compete
the
benefits
just
translate
into
greater
profits
and
bonuses
for
those
at
the
top
they
have
to
be
shared
by
american
workers
who
need
to
know
that
expanding
trade
and
opening
markets
will
lift
their
standards
of
living
as
well
as
your
bottom
line
we
go
back
to
the
kind
of
economy
and
culture
that
we
saw
in
the
years
leading
up
to
the
recession
where
growth
and
gains
in
productivity
just
did
translate
into
rising
incomes
and
opportunity
for
the
middle
class
that
not
something
necessarily
we
can
legislate
but
it
something
that
all
of
us
have
to
take
responsibility
for
thinking
about
how
do
we
make
sure
that
everybody
got
stake
in
trade
everybody
got
stake
in
increasing
exports
everybody
got
stake
in
rising
productivity
because
ordinary
folks
end
up
seeing
their
standards
of
living
rise
as
well
that
always
been
the
american
promise
that
what
meant
when
he
said
rising
tide
lifts
all
boats
too
many
boats
have
been
left
behind
stuck
in
the
mud
and
if
we
as
nation
are
going
to
invest
in
innovation
that
innovation
should
lead
to
new
jobs
and
manufacturing
on
our
shores
the
end
result
of
tax
breaks
and
investments
simply
be
that
new
breakthroughs
and
technologies
are
discovered
here
in
america
but
then
the
manufacturing
takes
place
overseas
that
too
breaks
the
social
compact
it
makes
people
feel
as
if
the
game
is
fixed
and
they
not
benefiting
from
the
extraordinary
discoveries
that
take
place
here
so
the
key
to
our
success
has
never
been
just
developing
new
ideas
it
also
been
making
new
products
so
pioneers
the
microchip
then
puts
thousands
to
work
building
them
in
silicon
valley
henry
ford
perfects
the
assembly
line
and
then
puts
generation
to
work
in
the
factories
of
detroit
that
how
we
built
the
largest
middle
class
in
the
world
those
folks
working
in
those
plants
they
go
out
and
they
buy
ford
they
buy
personal
computer
and
the
economy
grows
for
everyone
and
that
how
we
create
the
base
of
knowledge
and
skills
that
propel
the
next
inventions
and
the
next
ideas
right
now
businesses
across
this
country
are
proving
that
america
can
compete
caterpillar
is
opening
new
plant
to
build
excavators
in
texas
that
used
to
be
shipped
from
japan
in
whirlpool
is
opening
their
first
new
factory
in
more
than
decade
is
building
new
plant
in
michigan
to
manufacture
batteries
for
electric
vehicles
company
called
software
maker
decided
to
close
down
its
overseas
in
china
and
europe
and
move
their
here
to
the
united
states
these
companies
are
bringing
jobs
back
to
our
shores
and
that
good
for
everybody
so
if
got
one
message
my
message
is
now
is
the
time
to
invest
in
america
now
is
the
time
to
invest
in
america
today
american
companies
have
nearly
trillion
sitting
on
their
balance
sheets
and
know
that
many
of
you
have
told
me
that
you
waiting
for
demand
to
rise
before
you
get
off
the
sidelines
and
expand
and
that
with
millions
of
americans
out
of
work
demand
has
risen
more
slowly
than
any
of
us
would
like
we
in
this
together
but
many
of
your
own
economists
and
salespeople
are
now
forecasting
healthy
increase
in
demand
so
just
want
to
encourage
you
to
get
in
the
game
as
part
of
the
bipartisan
tax
deal
we
negotiated
with
the
support
of
the
chamber
businesses
can
immediately
expense
percent
of
their
capital
investments
and
as
all
of
you
know
it
investments
made
now
that
will
pay
off
as
the
economy
rebounds
and
as
you
hire
you
know
that
more
americans
working
will
mean
more
sales
for
your
companies
it
will
mean
more
demand
for
your
products
and
services
it
will
mean
higher
profits
for
your
companies
we
can
create
virtuous
circle
and
if
there
reason
you
do
share
my
confidence
if
there
reason
you
do
believe
that
this
is
the
time
to
get
off
the
sidelines
to
hire
and
to
invest
want
to
know
about
it
want
to
fix
it
that
why
asked
of
to
lead
new
council
of
business
leaders
and
outside
experts
so
that
we
getting
the
best
advice
on
what
you
facing
out
there
and
we
be
holding
our
first
meeting
two
weeks
from
now
on
the
so
you
can
get
your
in
early
with
your
ideas
with
your
thoughts
about
how
we
keep
moving
forward
to
create
this
virtuous
cycle
together
am
confident
we
can
win
the
competition
for
new
jobs
and
industries
and
know
you
share
my
enthusiasm
here
one
thing
know
for
all
the
disagreements
that
we
may
have
sometimes
on
issues
know
you
love
this
country
know
you
want
america
to
succeed
just
as
badly
as
do
so
yes
we
have
some
disagreements
and
yes
we
see
things
differently
at
times
but
we
all
americans
and
that
spirit
of
patriotism
and
that
sense
of
mutual
regard
and
common
obligation
that
has
carried
us
through
far
harder
times
than
the
ones
we
just
been
through
and
reminded
toward
the
end
of
the
amidst
the
depression
the
looming
prospect
of
war
president
he
would
need
to
form
new
partnership
with
business
if
we
were
going
to
become
what
he
would
later
call
the
arsenal
of
democracy
and
as
you
can
imagine
the
relationship
between
the
president
and
business
leaders
during
the
course
of
the
depression
had
been
rocky
at
times
they
grown
somewhat
fractured
by
the
new
deal
so
reached
out
to
businesses
and
business
leaders
answered
the
call
to
serve
their
country
after
years
of
working
at
cross
purposes
the
result
was
one
of
the
most
productive
collaborations
between
the
public
and
private
sectors
in
american
history
some
like
the
head
of
had
previously
known
the
president
and
if
anything
had
seen
him
as
an
adversary
but
he
gathered
his
family
and
he
explained
that
he
was
going
to
head
up
what
would
become
the
war
production
board
and
he
said
to
his
family
this
country
has
been
good
to
me
and
want
to
pay
it
back
want
to
pay
it
back
and
in
the
years
that
followed
automobile
factories
converted
to
making
planes
and
tanks
and
corset
factories
made
grenade
belts
toy
company
made
compasses
pinball
machine
maker
turned
out
shells
would
see
the
greatest
expansion
of
manufacturing
in
the
history
of
america
and
not
only
did
this
help
us
win
the
war
it
led
to
millions
of
new
jobs
and
helped
produce
the
great
american
middle
class
so
we
have
faced
hard
times
before
we
have
faced
moments
of
tumult
and
moments
of
change
and
we
know
what
to
do
we
know
how
to
succeed
we
are
americans
and
as
we
have
done
throughout
our
history
have
every
confidence
that
once
again
we
will
rise
to
this
occasion
that
we
can
come
together
we
can
adapt
and
we
can
thrive
in
this
changing
economy
and
we
need
to
look
no
further
than
the
innovative
companies
in
this
room
if
we
can
harness
your
potential
and
the
potential
of
your
people
across
this
country
think
there
no
stopping
us
so
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
distinguished
guests
and
fellow
americans
tonight
want
to
begin
by
congratulating
the
men
and
women
of
the
congress
as
well
as
your
new
speaker
john
and
as
we
mark
this
occasion
also
mindful
of
the
empty
chair
in
this
chamber
and
we
pray
for
the
health
of
our
colleague
and
our
friend
no
secret
that
those
of
us
here
tonight
have
had
our
differences
over
the
last
two
years
the
debates
have
been
contentious
we
have
fought
fiercely
for
our
beliefs
and
good
thing
what
robust
democracy
demands
what
helps
set
us
apart
as
nation
but
reason
the
tragedy
in
gave
us
pause
amid
all
the
noise
and
passion
and
of
our
public
debate
reminded
us
that
no
matter
who
we
are
or
where
we
come
from
each
of
us
is
part
of
something
greater
something
more
consequential
than
party
or
political
preference
we
are
part
of
the
american
family
we
believe
that
in
country
where
every
race
and
faith
and
point
of
view
can
be
found
we
are
still
bound
together
as
one
people
that
we
share
common
hopes
and
common
creed
that
the
dreams
of
little
girl
in
are
not
so
different
than
those
of
our
own
children
and
that
they
all
deserve
the
chance
to
be
fulfilled
that
too
is
what
sets
us
apart
as
nation
now
by
itself
this
simple
recognition
usher
in
new
era
of
cooperation
what
comes
of
this
moment
is
up
to
us
what
comes
of
this
moment
will
be
determined
not
by
whether
we
can
sit
together
tonight
but
whether
we
can
work
together
tomorrow
believe
we
can
and
believe
we
must
what
the
people
who
sent
us
here
expect
of
us
with
their
votes
determined
that
governing
will
now
be
shared
responsibility
between
parties
new
laws
will
only
pass
with
support
from
democrats
and
republicans
we
will
move
forward
together
or
not
at
all
for
the
challenges
we
face
are
bigger
than
party
and
bigger
than
politics
at
stake
right
now
is
not
who
wins
the
next
election
after
all
we
just
had
an
election
at
stake
is
whether
new
jobs
and
industries
take
root
in
this
country
or
somewhere
else
whether
the
hard
work
and
industry
of
our
people
is
rewarded
whether
we
sustain
the
leadership
that
has
made
america
not
just
place
on
map
but
the
light
to
the
world
we
are
poised
for
progress
two
years
after
the
worst
recession
most
of
us
have
ever
known
the
stock
market
has
come
roaring
back
corporate
profits
are
up
the
economy
is
growing
again
but
we
have
never
measured
progress
by
these
yardsticks
alone
we
measure
progress
by
the
success
of
our
people
by
the
jobs
they
can
find
and
the
quality
of
life
those
jobs
offer
by
the
prospects
of
small
business
owner
who
dreams
of
turning
good
idea
into
thriving
enterprise
by
the
opportunities
for
better
life
that
we
pass
on
to
our
children
the
project
the
american
people
want
us
to
work
on
together
we
did
that
in
december
thanks
to
the
tax
cuts
we
passed
are
little
bigger
today
every
business
can
write
off
the
full
cost
of
new
investments
that
they
make
this
year
and
these
steps
taken
by
democrats
and
republicans
will
grow
the
economy
and
add
to
the
more
than
one
million
private
sector
jobs
created
last
year
but
we
have
to
do
more
these
steps
taken
over
the
last
two
years
may
have
broken
the
back
of
this
recession
but
to
win
the
future
need
to
take
on
challenges
that
have
been
decades
in
the
making
many
people
watching
tonight
can
probably
remember
time
when
finding
good
job
meant
showing
up
at
nearby
factory
or
business
you
always
need
degree
and
your
competition
was
pretty
much
limited
to
your
if
you
worked
hard
chances
are
have
job
for
life
with
decent
and
good
benefits
and
the
occasional
promotion
maybe
even
have
the
pride
of
seeing
your
kids
work
at
the
same
company
that
world
has
changed
and
for
many
the
change
has
been
painful
seen
it
in
the
shuttered
windows
of
once
booming
factories
and
the
vacant
on
once
busy
main
streets
heard
it
in
the
frustrations
of
americans
seen
their
dwindle
or
their
jobs
disappear
proud
men
and
women
who
feel
like
the
rules
have
been
changed
in
the
middle
of
the
game
right
the
rules
have
changed
in
single
generation
revolutions
in
technology
have
transformed
the
way
we
live
work
and
do
business
steel
mills
that
once
needed
workers
can
now
do
the
same
work
with
today
just
about
any
company
can
set
up
shop
hire
workers
and
sell
their
products
wherever
an
internet
connection
meanwhile
nations
like
china
and
india
that
with
some
changes
of
their
own
they
could
compete
in
this
new
world
and
so
they
started
educating
their
children
earlier
and
longer
with
greater
emphasis
on
math
and
science
investing
in
research
and
new
technologies
just
recently
china
became
the
home
to
the
largest
private
solar
research
facility
and
the
fastest
computer
so
yes
the
world
has
changed
the
competition
for
jobs
is
real
but
this
discourage
us
it
should
challenge
us
remember
for
all
the
hits
taken
these
last
few
years
for
all
the
predicting
our
decline
america
still
has
the
largest
most
prosperous
economy
in
the
world
no
workers
no
workers
are
more
productive
than
ours
no
country
has
more
successful
companies
or
grants
more
patents
to
inventors
and
entrepreneurs
the
home
to
the
best
colleges
and
universities
where
more
students
come
to
study
than
any
place
on
earth
more
we
are
the
first
nation
to
be
founded
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
the
idea
that
each
of
us
deserves
the
chance
to
shape
our
own
destiny
why
centuries
of
pioneers
and
immigrants
have
risked
everything
to
come
here
why
our
students
just
equations
but
answer
questions
like
do
you
think
of
that
idea
what
would
you
change
about
the
world
what
do
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up
the
future
is
ours
to
win
but
to
get
there
we
just
stand
still
as
kennedy
told
us
future
is
not
gift
it
is
an
sustaining
the
american
dream
has
never
been
about
standing
pat
it
has
required
each
generation
to
sacrifice
and
struggle
and
meet
the
demands
of
new
age
and
now
our
turn
we
know
what
it
takes
to
compete
for
the
jobs
and
industries
of
our
time
we
need
to
and
the
rest
of
the
world
we
have
to
make
america
the
best
place
on
earth
to
do
business
we
need
to
take
responsibility
for
our
deficit
and
reform
our
government
how
our
people
will
prosper
how
win
the
future
and
tonight
like
to
talk
about
how
we
get
there
the
first
step
in
winning
the
future
is
encouraging
american
innovation
none
of
us
can
predict
with
certainty
what
the
next
big
industry
will
be
or
where
the
new
jobs
will
come
from
thirty
years
ago
we
know
that
something
called
the
internet
would
lead
to
an
economic
revolution
what
we
can
do
what
america
does
better
than
anyone
else
is
spark
the
creativity
and
imagination
of
our
people
the
nation
that
put
cars
in
driveways
and
computers
in
offices
the
nation
of
edison
and
the
wright
brothers
of
and
in
america
innovation
just
change
our
lives
it
is
how
we
make
our
living
our
free
enterprise
system
is
what
drives
innovation
but
because
not
always
profitable
for
companies
to
invest
in
basic
research
throughout
our
history
our
government
has
provided
scientists
and
inventors
with
the
support
that
they
need
what
planted
the
seeds
for
the
internet
what
helped
make
possible
things
like
computer
chips
and
just
think
of
all
the
good
jobs
from
manufacturing
to
retail
that
have
come
from
these
breakthroughs
half
century
ago
when
the
beat
us
into
space
with
the
launch
of
satellite
called
sputnik
we
had
no
idea
how
we
would
beat
them
to
the
moon
the
science
even
there
yet
exist
but
after
investing
in
better
research
and
education
we
just
surpass
the
we
unleashed
wave
of
innovation
that
created
new
industries
and
millions
of
new
jobs
this
is
our
sputnik
moment
two
years
ago
said
that
we
needed
to
reach
level
of
research
and
development
we
seen
since
the
height
of
the
space
race
and
in
few
weeks
will
be
sending
budget
to
congress
that
helps
us
meet
that
goal
invest
in
biomedical
research
information
technology
and
especially
clean
energy
technology
an
investment
that
will
strengthen
our
security
protect
our
planet
and
create
countless
new
jobs
for
our
people
already
seeing
the
promise
of
renewable
energy
and
are
brothers
who
run
small
michigan
roofing
company
after
september
they
volunteered
their
best
to
help
repair
the
pentagon
but
half
of
their
factory
went
unused
and
the
recession
hit
them
hard
today
with
the
help
of
government
loan
that
empty
space
is
being
used
to
manufacture
solar
shingles
that
are
being
sold
all
across
the
country
in
words
reinvented
what
americans
have
done
for
over
years
reinvented
ourselves
and
to
spur
on
more
success
stories
like
the
brothers
begun
to
reinvent
our
energy
policy
not
just
handing
out
money
issuing
challenge
telling
scientists
and
engineers
that
if
they
assemble
teams
of
the
best
minds
in
their
fields
and
focus
on
the
hardest
problems
in
clean
energy
fund
the
apollo
projects
of
our
time
at
the
california
institute
of
technology
developing
way
to
turn
sunlight
and
water
into
fuel
for
our
cars
at
oak
ridge
national
laboratory
using
supercomputers
to
get
lot
more
power
out
of
our
nuclear
facilities
with
more
research
and
incentives
we
can
break
our
dependence
on
oil
with
and
become
the
first
country
to
have
million
electric
vehicles
on
the
road
by
we
need
to
get
behind
this
innovation
and
to
help
pay
for
it
asking
congress
to
eliminate
the
billions
in
taxpayer
dollars
we
currently
give
to
oil
companies
know
if
know
if
noticed
but
doing
just
fine
on
their
own
so
instead
of
energy
invest
in
now
clean
energy
breakthroughs
will
only
translate
into
clean
energy
jobs
if
businesses
know
there
will
be
market
for
what
selling
so
tonight
challenge
you
to
join
me
in
setting
new
goal
by
percent
of
electricity
will
come
from
clean
energy
sources
some
folks
want
wind
and
solar
others
want
nuclear
clean
coal
and
natural
gas
to
meet
this
goal
we
will
need
them
all
and
urge
democrats
and
republicans
to
work
together
to
make
it
happen
maintaining
our
leadership
in
research
and
technology
is
crucial
to
success
but
if
we
want
to
win
the
future
if
we
want
innovation
to
produce
jobs
in
america
and
not
overseas
then
we
also
have
to
win
the
race
to
educate
our
kids
think
about
it
over
the
next
years
nearly
half
of
all
new
jobs
will
require
education
that
goes
beyond
high
school
education
and
yet
as
many
as
quarter
of
our
students
even
finishing
high
school
the
quality
of
our
math
and
science
education
lags
behind
many
other
nations
america
has
fallen
to
ninth
in
the
proportion
of
young
people
with
college
degree
and
so
the
question
is
whether
all
of
us
as
citizens
and
as
parents
are
willing
to
do
necessary
to
give
every
child
chance
to
succeed
that
responsibility
begins
not
in
our
classrooms
but
in
our
homes
and
communities
family
that
first
instills
the
love
of
learning
in
child
only
parents
can
make
sure
the
is
turned
off
and
homework
gets
done
we
need
to
teach
our
kids
that
not
just
the
winner
of
the
super
bowl
who
deserves
to
be
celebrated
but
the
winner
of
the
science
fair
we
need
to
teach
them
that
success
is
not
function
of
fame
or
but
of
hard
work
and
discipline
our
schools
share
this
responsibility
when
child
walks
into
classroom
it
should
be
place
of
high
expectations
and
high
performance
but
too
many
schools
meet
this
test
why
instead
of
just
pouring
money
into
system
not
working
we
launched
competition
called
race
to
the
top
to
all
states
we
said
you
show
us
the
most
innovative
plans
to
improve
teacher
quality
and
student
achievement
show
you
the
race
to
the
top
is
the
most
meaningful
reform
of
our
public
schools
in
generation
for
less
than
percent
of
what
we
spend
on
education
each
year
it
has
led
over
states
to
raise
their
standards
for
teaching
and
learning
and
these
standards
were
developed
by
the
way
not
by
washington
but
by
republican
and
democratic
governors
throughout
the
country
and
race
to
the
top
should
be
the
approach
we
follow
this
year
as
we
replace
no
child
left
behind
with
law
more
flexible
and
focused
on
best
for
our
kids
you
see
we
know
possible
from
our
children
when
reform
just
mandate
but
the
work
of
local
teachers
and
principals
school
boards
and
communities
take
school
like
in
denver
three
years
ago
it
was
rated
one
of
the
worst
schools
in
located
on
turf
between
two
rival
gangs
but
last
may
percent
of
the
seniors
received
their
diploma
most
will
be
the
first
in
their
families
to
go
to
college
and
after
the
first
year
of
the
transformation
the
principal
who
made
it
possible
wiped
away
tears
when
student
said
you
ms
waters
for
showing
that
we
are
smart
and
we
can
make
what
good
schools
can
do
and
we
want
good
schools
all
across
the
country
also
remember
that
after
parents
the
biggest
impact
on
success
comes
from
the
man
or
woman
at
the
front
of
the
classroom
in
south
korea
teachers
are
known
as
here
in
america
time
we
treated
the
people
who
educate
our
children
with
the
same
level
of
respect
we
want
to
reward
good
teachers
and
stop
making
excuses
for
bad
ones
and
over
the
next
years
with
so
many
baby
retiring
from
our
classrooms
we
want
to
prepare
new
teachers
in
the
fields
of
science
and
technology
and
engineering
and
math
in
fact
to
every
young
person
listening
tonight
contemplating
their
career
choice
if
you
want
to
make
difference
in
the
life
of
our
nation
if
you
want
to
make
difference
in
the
life
of
child
become
teacher
your
country
needs
you
of
course
the
education
race
end
with
high
school
diploma
to
compete
higher
education
must
be
within
the
reach
of
every
american
why
ended
the
unwarranted
taxpayer
subsidies
that
went
to
banks
and
used
the
savings
to
make
college
affordable
for
millions
of
students
and
this
year
ask
congress
to
go
further
and
make
permanent
our
tuition
tax
credit
worth
for
four
years
of
college
the
right
thing
to
do
because
people
need
to
be
able
to
train
for
new
jobs
and
careers
in
economy
also
community
colleges
last
month
saw
the
promise
of
these
schools
at
tech
in
north
many
of
the
students
there
used
to
work
in
the
surrounding
factories
that
have
since
left
town
one
mother
of
two
woman
named
proctor
had
worked
in
the
furniture
industry
since
she
was
years
old
and
she
told
me
earning
her
degree
in
biotechnology
now
at
years
old
not
just
because
the
furniture
jobs
are
gone
but
because
she
wants
to
inspire
her
children
to
pursue
their
dreams
too
as
said
hope
it
tells
them
to
never
give
if
we
take
these
steps
if
we
raise
expectations
for
every
child
and
give
them
the
best
possible
chance
at
an
education
from
the
day
they
are
born
until
the
last
job
they
take
we
will
reach
the
goal
that
set
two
years
ago
by
the
end
of
the
decade
america
will
once
again
have
the
highest
proportion
of
college
graduates
in
the
world
one
last
point
about
education
today
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
students
excelling
in
our
schools
who
are
not
american
citizens
some
are
the
children
of
undocumented
workers
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
actions
of
their
parents
they
grew
up
as
americans
and
pledge
allegiance
to
our
flag
and
yet
they
live
every
day
with
the
threat
of
deportation
others
come
here
from
abroad
to
study
in
our
colleges
and
universities
but
as
soon
as
they
obtain
advanced
degrees
we
send
them
back
home
to
compete
against
us
it
makes
no
sense
now
strongly
believe
that
we
should
take
on
once
and
for
all
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
and
am
prepared
to
work
with
republicans
and
democrats
to
protect
our
borders
enforce
our
laws
and
address
the
millions
of
undocumented
workers
who
are
now
living
in
the
shadows
know
that
debate
will
be
difficult
know
it
will
take
time
but
tonight
agree
to
make
that
effort
and
stop
expelling
talented
responsible
young
people
who
could
be
staffing
our
research
labs
or
starting
new
business
who
could
be
further
enriching
this
nation
the
third
step
in
winning
the
future
is
rebuilding
america
to
attract
new
businesses
to
our
shores
we
need
the
fastest
most
reliable
ways
to
move
people
goods
and
information
from
rail
to
internet
our
infrastructure
used
to
be
the
best
but
our
lead
has
slipped
south
korean
homes
now
have
greater
internet
access
than
we
do
countries
in
europe
and
russia
invest
more
in
their
roads
and
railways
than
we
do
china
is
building
faster
trains
and
newer
airports
meanwhile
when
our
own
engineers
graded
our
infrastructure
they
gave
us
we
have
to
do
better
america
is
the
nation
that
built
the
transcontinental
railroad
brought
electricity
to
rural
communities
constructed
the
highway
system
the
jobs
created
by
these
projects
just
come
from
laying
down
track
or
pavement
they
came
from
businesses
that
opened
near
new
train
station
or
the
new
so
over
the
last
two
years
begun
rebuilding
for
the
century
project
that
has
meant
thousands
of
good
jobs
for
the
construction
industry
and
tonight
proposing
that
we
redouble
those
efforts
put
more
americans
to
work
repairing
crumbling
roads
and
bridges
make
sure
this
is
fully
paid
for
attract
private
investment
and
pick
projects
based
on
best
for
the
economy
not
politicians
within
years
our
goal
is
to
give
percent
of
americans
access
to
rail
this
could
allow
you
to
go
places
in
half
the
time
it
takes
to
travel
by
car
for
some
trips
it
will
be
faster
than
flying
without
the
as
we
speak
routes
in
california
and
the
are
already
within
the
next
five
years
make
it
possible
for
businesses
to
deploy
the
next
generation
of
wireless
coverage
to
percent
of
all
americans
this
just
about
this
about
faster
internet
or
fewer
dropped
calls
about
connecting
every
part
of
america
to
the
digital
age
about
rural
community
in
or
alabama
where
farmers
and
small
business
owners
will
be
able
to
sell
their
products
all
over
the
world
about
firefighter
who
can
download
the
design
of
burning
building
onto
device
student
who
can
take
classes
with
digital
textbook
or
patient
who
can
have
video
chats
with
her
doctor
all
these
investments
in
innovation
education
and
infrastructure
will
make
america
better
place
to
do
business
and
create
jobs
but
to
help
our
companies
compete
we
also
have
to
knock
down
barriers
that
stand
in
the
way
of
their
success
for
example
over
the
years
parade
of
lobbyists
has
rigged
the
tax
code
to
benefit
particular
companies
and
industries
those
with
accountants
or
lawyers
to
work
the
system
can
end
up
paying
no
taxes
at
all
but
all
the
rest
are
hit
with
one
of
the
highest
corporate
tax
rates
in
the
world
it
makes
no
sense
and
it
has
to
change
so
tonight
asking
democrats
and
republicans
to
simplify
the
system
get
rid
of
the
loopholes
level
the
playing
field
and
use
the
savings
to
lower
the
corporate
tax
rate
for
the
first
time
in
years
without
adding
to
our
deficit
it
can
be
done
to
help
businesses
sell
more
products
abroad
we
set
goal
of
doubling
our
exports
by
because
the
more
we
export
the
more
jobs
we
create
here
at
home
already
our
exports
are
up
recently
we
signed
agreements
with
india
and
china
that
will
support
more
than
jobs
here
in
the
united
states
and
last
month
we
trade
agreement
with
south
korea
that
will
support
at
least
american
jobs
this
agreement
has
unprecedented
support
from
business
and
democrats
and
republicans
and
ask
this
congress
to
pass
it
as
soon
as
possible
now
before
took
office
made
it
clear
that
we
would
enforce
our
trade
agreements
and
that
would
only
sign
deals
that
keep
faith
with
american
workers
and
promote
american
jobs
what
we
did
with
korea
and
what
intend
to
do
as
we
pursue
agreements
with
panama
and
and
continue
our
asia
pacific
and
global
trade
talks
to
reduce
barriers
to
growth
and
investment
ordered
review
of
government
regulations
when
we
find
rules
that
put
an
unnecessary
burden
on
businesses
we
will
fix
them
but
will
not
hesitate
to
create
or
enforce
safeguards
to
protect
the
american
people
what
done
in
this
country
for
more
than
century
why
our
food
is
safe
to
eat
our
water
is
safe
to
drink
and
our
air
is
safe
to
breathe
why
we
have
speed
limits
and
child
laws
why
last
year
we
put
in
place
consumer
protections
against
hidden
fees
and
penalties
by
credit
card
companies
and
new
rules
to
prevent
another
financial
crisis
and
why
we
passed
reform
that
finally
prevents
the
health
insurance
industry
from
exploiting
patients
now
have
heard
that
few
of
you
still
have
concerns
about
our
new
health
care
law
so
let
me
be
the
first
to
say
that
anything
can
be
improved
if
you
have
ideas
about
how
to
improve
this
law
by
making
care
better
or
more
affordable
am
eager
to
work
with
you
we
can
start
right
now
by
correcting
flaw
in
the
legislation
that
has
placed
an
unnecessary
bookkeeping
burden
on
small
businesses
what
not
willing
to
do
what
not
willing
to
do
is
go
back
to
the
days
when
insurance
companies
could
deny
someone
coverage
because
of
condition
not
willing
to
tell
james
brain
cancer
patient
from
texas
that
his
treatment
might
not
be
covered
not
willing
to
tell
small
business
man
from
that
he
has
to
go
back
to
paying
more
to
cover
his
employees
as
we
speak
this
law
is
making
prescription
drugs
cheaper
for
seniors
and
giving
uninsured
students
chance
to
stay
on
their
coverage
so
say
to
this
chamber
tonight
instead
of
the
battles
of
the
last
two
years
fix
what
needs
fixing
and
move
forward
now
the
final
critical
step
in
winning
the
future
is
to
make
sure
we
buried
under
mountain
of
debt
we
are
living
with
legacy
of
deficit
spending
that
began
almost
decade
ago
and
in
the
wake
of
the
financial
crisis
some
of
that
was
necessary
to
keep
credit
flowing
save
jobs
and
put
money
in
pockets
but
now
that
the
worst
of
the
recession
is
over
we
have
to
confront
the
fact
that
our
government
spends
more
than
it
takes
in
that
is
not
sustainable
every
day
families
sacrifice
to
live
within
their
means
they
deserve
government
that
does
the
same
so
tonight
am
proposing
that
starting
this
year
we
freeze
annual
domestic
spending
for
the
next
five
years
now
this
would
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
billion
over
the
next
decade
and
will
bring
discretionary
spending
to
the
lowest
share
of
our
economy
since
was
president
this
freeze
will
require
painful
cuts
already
frozen
the
salaries
of
hardworking
federal
employees
for
the
next
two
years
proposed
cuts
to
things
care
deeply
about
like
community
action
programs
the
secretary
of
has
also
agreed
to
cut
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
spending
that
he
and
his
generals
believe
our
military
can
do
without
that
some
in
this
chamber
have
already
proposed
deeper
cuts
and
willing
to
eliminate
whatever
we
can
honestly
afford
to
do
without
but
make
sure
that
not
doing
it
on
the
backs
of
our
most
vulnerable
citizens
and
make
sure
that
what
cutting
is
really
excess
weight
cutting
the
deficit
by
gutting
our
investments
in
innovation
and
education
is
like
lightening
an
overloaded
airplane
by
removing
its
engine
it
may
make
you
feel
like
flying
high
at
first
but
it
take
long
before
you
feel
the
impact
now
most
of
the
cuts
and
savings
proposed
only
address
annual
domestic
spending
which
represents
little
more
than
percent
of
our
budget
to
make
further
progress
we
have
to
stop
pretending
that
cutting
this
kind
of
spending
alone
will
be
enough
it
the
bipartisan
fiscal
commission
created
last
year
made
this
crystal
clear
agree
with
all
their
proposals
but
they
made
important
progress
and
their
conclusion
is
that
the
only
way
to
tackle
our
deficit
is
to
cut
excessive
spending
wherever
we
find
it
in
domestic
spending
spending
health
care
spending
and
spending
through
tax
breaks
and
loopholes
this
means
further
reducing
health
care
costs
including
programs
like
and
which
are
the
single
biggest
contributor
to
our
deficit
the
health
insurance
law
we
passed
last
year
will
slow
these
rising
costs
which
is
part
of
the
reason
that
economists
have
said
that
repealing
the
health
care
law
would
add
quarter
of
trillion
dollars
to
our
deficit
still
willing
to
look
at
other
ideas
to
bring
down
costs
including
one
that
republicans
suggested
last
year
medical
malpractice
reform
to
rein
in
frivolous
lawsuits
to
put
us
on
solid
ground
we
should
also
find
bipartisan
solution
to
strengthen
social
security
for
future
generations
we
must
do
it
without
putting
at
risk
current
the
most
vulnerable
or
people
with
disabilities
without
slashing
benefits
for
future
generations
and
without
subjecting
guaranteed
retirement
income
to
the
whims
of
the
stock
market
and
if
we
truly
care
about
our
deficit
we
simply
afford
permanent
extension
of
the
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthiest
percent
of
americans
before
we
take
money
away
from
our
schools
or
scholarships
away
from
our
students
we
should
ask
millionaires
to
give
up
their
tax
break
not
matter
of
punishing
their
success
about
promoting
success
in
fact
the
best
thing
we
could
do
on
taxes
for
all
americans
is
to
simplify
the
individual
tax
code
this
will
be
tough
job
but
members
of
both
parties
have
expressed
an
interest
in
doing
this
and
am
prepared
to
join
them
so
now
is
the
time
to
act
now
is
the
time
for
both
sides
and
both
houses
of
congress
democrats
and
republicans
to
forge
principled
compromise
that
gets
the
job
done
if
we
make
the
hard
choices
now
to
rein
in
our
deficits
we
can
make
the
investments
we
need
to
win
the
future
let
me
take
this
one
step
further
we
just
give
our
people
government
more
affordable
we
should
give
them
government
more
competent
and
more
efficient
we
win
the
future
with
government
of
the
past
we
live
and
do
business
in
the
information
age
but
the
last
major
of
the
government
happened
in
the
age
of
there
are
different
agencies
that
deal
with
exports
there
are
at
least
five
different
agencies
that
deal
with
housing
policy
then
my
example
the
interior
department
is
in
charge
of
salmon
while
in
fresh
water
but
the
commerce
department
handles
them
when
in
saltwater
hear
it
gets
even
more
complicated
once
smoked
now
made
great
strides
over
the
last
two
years
in
using
technology
and
getting
rid
of
waste
veterans
can
now
download
their
electronic
medical
records
with
click
of
the
mouse
selling
acres
of
federal
office
space
that
been
used
in
years
and
cut
through
red
tape
to
get
rid
of
more
but
we
need
to
think
bigger
in
the
coming
months
my
administration
will
develop
proposal
to
merge
consolidate
and
the
federal
government
in
way
that
best
serves
the
goal
of
more
competitive
america
will
submit
that
proposal
to
congress
for
vote
and
we
will
push
to
get
it
passed
in
the
coming
year
also
work
to
rebuild
faith
in
the
institution
of
government
because
you
deserve
to
know
exactly
how
and
where
your
tax
dollars
are
being
spent
be
able
to
go
to
website
and
get
that
information
for
the
very
first
time
in
history
because
you
deserve
to
know
when
your
elected
officials
are
meeting
with
lobbyists
ask
congress
to
do
what
the
white
house
has
already
done
put
that
information
and
because
the
american
people
deserve
to
know
that
special
interests
up
legislation
with
pet
projects
both
parties
in
congress
should
know
this
if
bill
comes
to
my
desk
with
inside
will
veto
it
will
veto
it
the
century
government
open
and
competent
government
that
lives
within
its
means
an
economy
driven
by
new
skills
and
new
ideas
our
success
in
this
new
and
changing
world
will
require
reform
responsibility
and
innovation
it
will
also
require
us
to
approach
that
world
with
new
level
of
engagement
in
our
foreign
affairs
just
as
jobs
and
businesses
can
now
race
across
borders
so
can
new
threats
and
new
challenges
no
single
wall
separates
east
and
west
no
one
rival
superpower
is
aligned
against
us
and
so
we
must
defeat
determined
enemies
wherever
they
are
and
build
coalitions
that
cut
across
lines
of
region
and
race
and
religion
and
moral
example
must
always
shine
for
all
who
yearn
for
freedom
and
justice
and
dignity
and
because
begun
this
work
tonight
we
can
say
that
american
leadership
has
been
renewed
and
standing
has
been
restored
look
to
iraq
where
nearly
of
our
brave
men
and
women
have
left
with
their
heads
held
high
american
combat
patrols
have
ended
violence
is
down
and
new
government
has
been
formed
this
year
our
civilians
will
forge
lasting
partnership
with
the
iraqi
people
while
we
finish
the
job
of
bringing
our
troops
out
of
iraq
commitment
has
been
kept
the
iraq
war
is
coming
to
an
end
of
course
as
we
speak
and
their
affiliates
continue
to
plan
attacks
against
us
thanks
to
our
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
professionals
disrupting
plots
and
securing
our
cities
and
skies
and
as
extremists
try
to
inspire
acts
of
violence
within
our
borders
we
are
responding
with
the
strength
of
our
communities
with
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
and
with
the
conviction
that
american
muslims
are
part
of
our
american
family
also
taken
the
fight
to
and
their
allies
abroad
in
our
troops
have
taken
strongholds
and
trained
afghan
security
forces
our
purpose
is
clear
by
preventing
the
from
stranglehold
over
the
afghan
people
we
will
deny
the
safe
haven
that
served
as
launching
pad
for
thanks
to
our
heroic
troops
and
civilians
fewer
afghans
are
under
the
control
of
the
insurgency
there
will
be
tough
fighting
ahead
and
the
afghan
government
will
need
to
deliver
better
governance
but
we
are
strengthening
the
capacity
of
the
afghan
people
and
building
an
enduring
partnership
with
them
this
year
we
will
work
with
nearly
countries
to
begin
transition
to
an
afghan
lead
and
this
july
we
will
begin
to
bring
our
troops
home
in
pakistan
leadership
is
under
more
pressure
than
at
any
point
since
their
leaders
and
operatives
are
being
removed
from
the
battlefield
their
safe
havens
are
shrinking
and
sent
message
from
the
afghan
border
to
the
arabian
peninsula
to
all
parts
of
the
globe
we
will
not
relent
we
will
not
waver
and
we
will
defeat
you
american
leadership
can
also
be
seen
in
the
effort
to
secure
the
worst
weapons
of
war
because
republicans
and
democrats
approved
the
new
start
treaty
far
fewer
nuclear
weapons
and
launchers
will
be
deployed
because
we
rallied
the
world
nuclear
materials
are
being
locked
down
on
every
continent
so
they
never
fall
into
the
hands
of
terrorists
because
of
diplomatic
effort
to
insist
that
iran
meet
its
obligations
the
iranian
government
now
faces
tougher
sanctions
tighter
sanctions
than
ever
before
and
on
the
korean
peninsula
we
stand
with
our
ally
south
korea
and
insist
that
north
korea
keeps
its
commitment
to
abandon
nuclear
weapons
this
is
just
part
of
how
shaping
world
that
peace
and
prosperity
with
our
european
allies
we
nato
and
increased
our
cooperation
on
everything
from
to
missile
reset
our
relationship
with
russia
strengthened
asian
alliances
built
new
partnerships
with
nations
like
india
this
march
will
travel
to
brazil
and
to
forge
new
alliances
across
the
around
the
globe
standing
with
those
who
take
responsibility
helping
farmers
grow
more
food
supporting
doctors
who
care
for
the
sick
and
combating
the
corruption
that
can
rot
society
and
rob
people
of
opportunity
recent
events
have
shown
us
that
what
sets
us
apart
must
not
just
be
our
power
it
must
also
be
the
purpose
behind
it
in
south
sudan
with
our
assistance
the
people
were
finally
able
to
vote
for
independence
after
years
of
war
thousands
lined
up
before
dawn
people
danced
in
the
streets
one
man
who
lost
four
of
his
brothers
at
war
summed
up
the
scene
around
him
was
battlefield
for
most
of
my
life
he
said
we
want
to
be
and
we
saw
that
same
desire
to
be
free
in
tunisia
where
the
will
of
the
people
proved
more
powerful
than
the
writ
of
dictator
and
tonight
let
us
be
clear
the
united
states
of
america
stands
with
the
people
of
tunisia
and
supports
the
democratic
aspirations
of
all
people
we
must
never
forget
that
the
things
struggled
for
and
fought
for
live
in
the
hearts
of
people
everywhere
and
we
must
always
remember
that
the
americans
who
have
borne
the
greatest
burden
in
this
struggle
are
the
men
and
women
who
serve
our
country
tonight
let
us
speak
with
one
voice
in
reaffirming
that
our
nation
is
united
in
support
of
our
troops
and
their
families
let
us
serve
them
as
well
as
served
us
by
giving
them
the
equipment
they
need
by
providing
them
with
the
care
and
benefits
that
they
have
earned
and
by
enlisting
our
veterans
in
the
great
task
of
building
our
own
nation
our
troops
come
from
every
corner
of
this
country
black
white
latino
asian
native
american
they
are
christian
and
hindu
jewish
and
muslim
and
yes
we
know
that
some
of
them
are
gay
starting
this
year
no
american
will
be
forbidden
from
serving
the
country
they
love
because
of
who
they
love
and
with
that
change
call
on
all
our
college
campuses
to
open
their
doors
to
our
military
recruiters
and
it
is
time
to
leave
behind
the
divisive
battles
of
the
past
it
is
time
to
move
forward
as
one
nation
we
should
have
no
illusions
about
the
work
ahead
of
us
reforming
our
schools
changing
the
way
we
use
energy
reducing
our
deficit
none
of
this
will
be
easy
all
of
it
will
take
time
and
it
will
be
harder
because
we
will
argue
about
everything
the
costs
the
details
the
letter
of
every
law
of
course
some
countries
have
this
problem
if
the
central
government
wants
railroad
they
build
railroad
no
matter
how
many
homes
get
bulldozed
if
they
want
bad
story
in
the
newspaper
it
get
written
and
yet
as
contentious
and
frustrating
and
messy
as
our
democracy
can
sometimes
be
know
there
person
here
who
would
trade
places
with
any
other
nation
on
earth
we
may
have
differences
in
policy
but
we
all
believe
in
the
rights
enshrined
in
our
constitution
we
may
have
different
opinions
but
we
believe
in
the
same
promise
that
says
this
is
place
where
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
we
may
have
different
backgrounds
but
we
believe
in
the
same
dream
that
says
this
is
country
where
anything
is
possible
no
matter
who
you
are
no
matter
where
you
come
from
that
dream
is
why
can
stand
here
before
you
tonight
that
dream
is
why
kid
from
can
sit
behind
me
that
dream
is
why
someone
who
began
by
sweeping
the
floors
of
his
bar
can
preside
as
speaker
of
the
house
in
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
that
dream
that
american
dream
is
what
drove
the
brothers
to
reinvent
their
roofing
company
for
new
era
what
drove
those
students
at
tech
to
learn
new
skill
and
work
towards
the
future
and
that
dream
is
the
story
of
small
business
owner
named
fisher
started
company
in
berlin
that
in
new
kind
of
drilling
technology
and
one
day
last
summer
he
saw
the
news
that
halfway
across
the
world
men
were
trapped
in
chilean
mine
and
no
one
knew
how
to
save
them
but
thought
his
company
could
help
and
so
he
designed
rescue
that
would
come
to
be
known
as
plan
his
employees
worked
around
the
clock
to
manufacture
the
necessary
drilling
equipment
and
left
for
along
with
others
he
began
drilling
hole
into
the
ground
working
or
three
or
four
days
at
time
without
any
sleep
days
later
plan
succeeded
and
the
miners
were
rescued
but
because
he
want
all
of
the
attention
there
when
the
miners
emerged
already
gone
back
home
back
to
work
on
his
next
project
and
later
one
of
his
employees
said
of
the
rescue
proved
that
rock
is
little
company
but
we
do
big
we
do
big
things
from
the
earliest
days
of
our
founding
america
has
been
the
story
of
ordinary
people
who
dare
to
dream
how
we
win
the
future
nation
that
says
might
not
have
lot
of
money
but
have
this
great
idea
for
new

not
come
from
family
of
college
graduates
but
will
be
the
first
to
get
my
might
not
know
those
people
in
trouble
but
think
can
help
them
and
need
to
not
sure
how
reach
that
better
place
beyond
the
horizon
but
know
get
there
know
we
we
do
big
things
the
idea
of
america
endures
our
destiny
remains
our
choice
and
tonight

than
two
centuries
later

our
people

future
is
hopeful

journey

the
only
girl
on
her
little
league
team
no
one
put
it
past
her
she
showed
an
appreciation
for
life
uncommon
for
girl
her
age
remind
her
mother
are
so
blessed
we
have
the
best
and
pay
those
blessings
back
by
participating
in
charity
that
helped
children
who
were
less
fortunate
our
hearts
are
broken
by
their
sudden
passing
our
hearts
are
broken
and
yet
our
hearts
also
have
reason
for
fullness
our
hearts
are
full
of
hope
and
thanks
for
the
americans
who
survived
the
shooting
including
the
many
of
them
went
to
see
on
saturday
have
just
come
from
the
university
medical
just
mile
from
here
where
our
friend
courageously
fights
to
recover
even
as
we
speak
and
want
to
tell
you
her
husband
mark
is
here
and
he
allows
me
to
share
this
with
you
right
after
we
went
to
visit
few
minutes
after
we
left
her
room
and
some
of
her
colleagues
in
congress
were
in
the
room
opened
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
opened
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
opened
her
eyes
opened
her
eyes
so
can
tell
you
she
knows
we
are
here
she
knows
we
love
her
and
she
knows
that
we
are
rooting
for
her
through
what
is
undoubtedly
going
to
be
difficult
journey
we
are
there
for
her
our
hearts
are
full
of
thanks
for
that
good
news
and
our
hearts
are
full
of
gratitude
for
those
who
saved
others
we
are
grateful
to
daniel
volunteer
in
office
and
daniel
sorry
you
may
deny
it
but
decided
you
are
hero
because
you
ran
through
the
chaos
to
minister
to
your
boss
and
tended
to
her
wounds
and
helped
keep
her
alive
we
are
grateful
to
the
men
who
tackled
the
gunman
as
he
stopped
to
reload
right
over
there
we
are
grateful
for
petite
who
wrestled
away
the
ammunition
and
undoubtedly
saved
some
lives
and
we
are
grateful
for
the
doctors
and
nurses
and
first
responders
who
worked
wonders
to
heal
those
been
hurt
we
are
grateful
to
them
these
men
and
women
remind
us
that
heroism
is
found
not
only
on
the
fields
of
battle
they
remind
us
that
heroism
does
not
require
special
training
or
physical
strength
heroism
is
here
in
the
hearts
of
so
many
of
our
fellow
citizens
all
around
us
just
waiting
to
be
summoned
as
it
was
on
saturday
morning
their
actions
their
poses
challenge
to
each
of
us
it
raises
question
of
what
beyond
prayers
and
expressions
of
concern
is
required
of
us
going
forward
how
can
we
the
fallen
how
can
we
be
true
to
their
memory
you
see
when
tragedy
like
this
strikes
it
is
part
of
our
nature
to
demand
explanations
to
try
and
pose
some
order
on
the
chaos
and
make
sense
out
of
that
which
seems
senseless
already
seen
national
conversation
commence
not
only
about
the
motivations
behind
these
killings
but
about
everything
from
the
merits
of
gun
safety
laws
to
the
adequacy
of
our
mental
health
system
and
much
of
this
process
of
debating
what
might
be
done
to
prevent
such
tragedies
in
the
future
is
an
essential
ingredient
in
our
exercise
of
but
at
time
when
our
discourse
has
become
so
sharply
at
time
when
we
are
far
too
eager
to
lay
the
blame
for
all
that
ails
the
world
at
the
feet
of
those
who
happen
to
think
differently
than
we
do
important
for
us
to
pause
for
moment
and
make
sure
that
talking
with
each
other
in
way
that
heals
not
in
way
that
wounds
scripture
tells
us
that
there
is
evil
in
the
world
and
that
terrible
things
happen
for
reasons
that
defy
human
understanding
in
the
words
of
job
looked
for
light
then
came
bad
things
happen
and
we
have
to
guard
against
simple
explanations
in
the
aftermath
for
the
truth
is
none
of
us
can
know
exactly
what
triggered
this
vicious
attack
none
of
us
can
know
with
any
certainty
what
might
have
stopped
these
shots
from
being
fired
or
what
thoughts
lurked
in
the
inner
recesses
of
violent
mind
yes
we
have
to
examine
all
the
facts
behind
this
tragedy
we
can
not
and
will
not
be
passive
in
the
face
of
such
violence
we
should
be
willing
to
challenge
old
assumptions
in
order
to
lessen
the
prospects
of
such
violence
in
the
future
but
what
we
can
not
do
is
use
this
tragedy
as
one
more
occasion
to
turn
on
each
other
that
we
can
not
do
that
we
can
not
do
as
we
discuss
these
issues
let
each
of
us
do
so
with
good
dose
of
humility
rather
than
pointing
fingers
or
assigning
blame
use
this
occasion
to
expand
our
moral
imaginations
to
listen
to
each
other
more
carefully
to
sharpen
our
instincts
for
empathy
and
remind
ourselves
of
all
the
ways
that
our
hopes
and
dreams
are
bound
together
after
all
what
most
of
us
do
when
we
lose
somebody
in
our
family
especially
if
the
loss
is
unexpected
shaken
out
of
our
routines
forced
to
look
inward
we
reflect
on
the
past
did
we
spend
enough
time
with
an
aging
parent
we
wonder
did
we
express
our
gratitude
for
all
the
sacrifices
that
they
made
for
us
did
we
tell
spouse
just
how
desperately
we
loved
them
not
just
once
in
while
but
every
single
day
so
sudden
loss
causes
us
to
look
backward
but
it
also
forces
us
to
look
forward
to
reflect
on
the
present
and
the
future
on
the
manner
in
which
we
live
our
lives
and
nurture
our
relationships
with
those
who
are
still
with
us
we
may
ask
ourselves
if
shown
enough
kindness
and
generosity
and
compassion
to
the
people
in
our
lives
perhaps
we
question
whether
we
doing
right
by
our
children
or
our
community
whether
our
priorities
are
in
order
we
our
own
mortality
and
we
are
reminded
that
in
the
fleeting
time
we
have
on
this
earth
what
matters
is
not
wealth
or
status
or
power
or
fame
but
rather
how
well
we
have
loved
and
what
small
part
we
have
played
in
making
the
lives
of
other
people
better
and
that
process
that
process
of
reflection
of
making
sure
we
align
our
values
with
our
actions
that
believe
is
what
tragedy
like
this
requires
for
those
who
were
harmed
those
who
were
killed
they
are
part
of
our
family
an
american
family
million
strong
we
may
not
have
known
them
personally
but
surely
we
see
ourselves
in
them
in
george
and
dot
in
and
we
sense
the
abiding
love
we
have
for
our
own
husbands
our
own
wives
our
own
life
partners
our
mom
or
our
grandma
our
brother
or
son
in
judge
roll
we
not
only
man
who
prized
his
family
and
doing
his
job
well
but
also
man
who
embodied
fidelity
to
the
law
and
in
in
we
see
reflection
of
our
that
desire
to
participate
in
that
sometimes
frustrating
sometimes
contentious
but
always
necessary
and
process
to
form
more
perfect
union
and
in
in
we
see
all
of
our
children
so
curious
so
trusting
so
energetic
so
full
of
magic
so
deserving
of
our
love
and
so
deserving
of
our
good
example
if
this
tragedy
prompts
reflection
and
debate
as
it
should
make
sure
worthy
of
those
we
have
lost
make
sure
not
on
the
usual
plane
of
politics
and
and
pettiness
that
drifts
away
in
the
next
news
cycle
the
loss
of
these
wonderful
people
should
make
every
one
of
us
strive
to
be
better
to
be
better
in
our
private
lives
to
be
better
friends
and
and
coworkers
and
parents
and
if
as
has
been
discussed
in
recent
days
their
death
helps
usher
in
more
civility
in
our
public
discourse
let
us
remember
it
is
not
because
simple
lack
of
civility
caused
this
tragedy
it
did
not
but
rather
because
only
more
civil
and
honest
public
discourse
can
help
us
face
up
to
the
challenges
of
our
nation
in
way
that
would
make
them
proud
we
should
be
civil
because
we
want
to
live
up
to
the
example
of
public
servants
like
john
roll
and
who
knew
first
and
foremost
that
we
are
all
americans
and
that
we
can
question
each
ideas
without
questioning
each
love
of
country
and
that
our
task
working
together
is
to
constantly
widen
the
circle
of
our
concern
so
that
we
bequeath
the
american
dream
to
future
generations
they
believed
they
believed
and
believe
that
we
can
be
better
those
who
died
here
those
who
saved
life
here
they
help
me
believe
we
may
not
be
able
to
stop
all
evil
in
the
world
but
know
that
how
we
treat
one
another
entirely
up
to
us
and
believe
that
for
all
our
imperfections
we
are
full
of
decency
and
goodness
and
that
the
forces
that
divide
us
are
not
as
strong
as
those
that
unite
us
what
believe
in
part
because
what
child
like
taylor
green
believed
imagine
imagine
for
moment
here
was
young
girl
who
was
just
becoming
aware
of
our
democracy
just
beginning
to
understand
the
obligations
of
citizenship
just
starting
to
glimpse
the
fact
that
some
day
she
too
might
play
part
in
shaping
her
future
she
had
been
elected
to
her
student
council
she
saw
public
service
as
something
exciting
and
hopeful
she
was
off
to
meet
her
someone
she
was
sure
was
good
and
important
and
might
be
role
model
she
saw
all
this
through
the
eyes
of
child
by
the
cynicism
or
vitriol
that
we
adults
all
too
often
just
take
for
granted
want
to
live
up
to
her
expectations
want
our
democracy
to
be
as
good
as
imagined
it
want
america
to
be
as
good
as
she
imagined
it
all
of
us
we
should
do
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
this
country
lives
up
to
our
expectations
as
has
already
been
mentioned
was
given
to
us
on
september
one
of
babies
born
that
day
to
be
pictured
in
book
called
of
on
either
side
of
her
photo
in
that
book
were
simple
wishes
for
life
hope
you
help
those
in
need
read
one
hope
you
know
all
the
words
to
the
national
anthem
and
sing
it
with
your
hand
over
your
heart
hope
hope
you
jump
in
rain
if
there
are
rain
puddles
in
heaven
is
jumping
in
them
today
and
here
on
this
earth
here
on
this
earth
we
place
our
hands
over
our
hearts
and
we
commit
ourselves
as
americans
to
forging
country
that
is
forever
worthy
of
her
gentle
happy
spirit
may
god
bless
and
keep
those
lost
in
restful
and
eternal
peace
may
he
love
and
watch
over
the
survivors
and
may
he
bless
the
united
states
of
america

blessings

and
as

begin
this
holiday
season
there
is
no
place
that
rather
be
than
be
here
with
you
know
not
easy
for
all
of
you
to
be
away
from
home
especially
during
the
holidays
and
know
hard
on
your
families
got
an
empty
seat
at
the
dinner
table
sometimes
during
the
holiday
season
when
you
feel
the
absence
of
somebody
you
love
most
acutely
but
what
want
you
to
know
as
president
of
the
united
states
have
no
greater
responsibility
than
keeping
the
american
people
secure
could
not
meet
that
responsibility
we
could
not
protect
the
american
people
we
could
not
enjoy
the
blessings
of
our
liberty
without
the
extraordinary
service
that
each
and
every
one
of
you
perform
each
and
every
day
so
on
behalf
of
me
on
behalf
of
on
behalf
of
and
on
behalf
of
more
than
million
americans

say
thank
you
we
are
here

everything
that

also
want
to
say
thank
you
to
your
families
back
home
so
that
when
you
talk
to
them
you
know
that
they
know
serving
here
with
you
in
mind
and
spirit
if
not
in
body
millions
of
americans
give
thanks
this
holiday
season
just
as
generations
have
before
when
they
think
about
our
armed
services
part
of
an
unbroken
line
of
americans
who
have
given
up
your
comfort
your
ease
your
convenience
for
security
it
was
on
another
cold
december
more
than
years
ago
that
band
of
patriots
helped
to
found
our
nation
defeat
an
empire
from
that
icy
river
to
the
fields
of
europe
from
the
islands
in
the
pacific
to
the
hills
of
korea
from
the
jungles
of
to
the
deserts
of
iraq
those
who
went
before
you
they
also
found
themselves
in
this
season
of
peace
serving
in
war
they
did
it
for
the
same
reason
that
all
of
you
do
because
the
freedom
and
the
liberty
that
we
treasure
not
simply
birthright
it
has
to
be
earned
by
the
sacrifices
of
generations
generations
of
patriots
men
and
women
who
step
forward
and
say
send
me
know
somebody
has
got
to
do
it
and
willing
to
serve
men
and
women
who
are
willing
to
risk
all
and
some
who
gave
all
to
keep
us
safe
to
keep
us
free
in
our
time
in
this
century
when
so
many
other
institutions
seem
to
be
shirking
their
responsibilities
embraced
your
responsibilities
shown
why
the
united
states
military
remains
the
most
trusted
institution
in
america
the
legacy
that
your
generation
has
forged
during
this
decade
of
trial
in
iraq
and
here
in
the
legacy
that
carrying
forward
as
general
mentioned
one
year
ago
ordered
additional
troops
to
serve
in
this
country
that
was
the
staging
ground
for
the
attacks
all
of
those
troops
are
now
in
place
and
thanks
to
your
service
we
are
making
important
progress
you
are
protecting
your
country
achieving
your
objectives
you
will
succeed
in
your
mission
we
said
we
were
going
to
break
the
momentum
and
what
doing
going
on
the
tired
of
playing
targeting
their
leaders
pushing
them
out
of
their
strongholds
today
we
can
be
proud
that
there
are
fewer
areas
under
control
and
more
afghans
have
chance
to
build
more
hopeful
future
we
said
year
ago
that
going
to
build
the
capacity
of
the
afghan
people
and
what
doing
meeting
our
recruitment
targets
training
afghan
forces
partnering
with
those
afghans
who
want
to
build
stronger
and
more
stable
and
more
prosperous
need
to
tell
you
this
is
tough
fight
just
came
from
the
medical
unit
and
saw
our
wounded
warriors
pinned
some
purple
hearts
just
talked
to
the
platoon
that
lost
six
of
their
buddies
in
senseless
act
of
violence
this
is
tough
business
progress
comes
slow
there
are
going
to
be
difficult
days
ahead
progress
comes
at
high
price
so
many
of
you
have
stood
before
the
solemn
battle
cross
display
of
boots
rifle
helmet
and
said
to
fallen
comrade
this
year
alone
nearly
members
of
have
given
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
there
are
few
days
when
sign
letter
to
military
family
expressing
our
gratitude
and
grief
at
their
profound
sacrifice
and
this
holiday
season
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
those
lost
loved
one
the
father
and
mother
the
son
or
daughter
the
brother
or
sister
or
friend
not
coming
home
and
we
know
that
their
memories
will
never
be
forgotten
and
that
their
life
has
added
to
the
life
of
our
nation
and
because
of
the
service
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
military
because
of
the
progress
making
we
look
forward
to
new
phase
next
year
the
beginning
of
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
as
we
do
we
continue
to
forge
partnership
with
the
afghan
people
for
the
long
term
and
we
will
never
let
this
country
serve
as
safe
haven
for
terrorists
who
would
attack
the
united
states
of
america
again
that
will
never
happen
this
part
of
the
world
is
the
of
global
effort
where
we
are
going
to
disrupt
and
dismantle
and
defeat
and
its
extremist
allies
and
why
here
why
your
mission
matters
so
much
why
you
must
succeed
because
this
effort
is
about
the
safety
of
our
communities
back
home
and
the
dignity
of
the
afghan
people
who
want
to
live
in
tyranny
now
even
though
it
is
hallmark
of
american
democracy
that
we
have
our
arguments
back
home
we
have
our
debates
we
have
our
elections
can
say
without
hesitation
that
there
is
no
division
on
one
thing
no
hesitation
on
one
thing
and
that
is
the
uniform
support
of
our
men
and
women
who
are
serving
in
the
armed
services
everybody
everybody
is
behind
you
everybody
back
home
is
behind
you
everybody
from
north
to
south
to
east
to
west
from
sea
to
shining
sea
the
american
people
are
united
in
support
of
you
and
your
families
and
as
your
also
want
you
to
know
that
we
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
make
sure
that
you
have
the
strategy
and
the
resources
and
the
equipment
and
the
leadership
to
get
this
done
you
may
have
noticed
that
during
these
tough
budget
times
took
the
step
of
freezing
pay
for
our
federal
workforce
but
because
of
the
service
that
you
rendered
all
who
wear
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
of
america
are
exempt
from
that
action
and
going
to
make
going
to
spare
no
effort
to
make
sure
that
your
families
have
the
support
that
they
deserve
as
well
that
just
matter
to
me
also
top
priority
for
to
make
sure
that
americans
understand
the
sacrifices
that
your
families
are
making
as
she
likes
to
say
percent
of
americans
need
to
be
right
they
are
supporting
you
and
your
families
percent
only
percent
are
fighting
these
wars
but
percent
of
us
have
to
be
behind
you
and
your
families
your
generation
the
generation
of
and
iraq
has
met
every
mission
that
been
given
served
tour
after
tour
earned
not
just
our
admiration
earned
your
place
in
american
history
alongside
those
greatest
generations
and
the
stories
of
those
who
served
in
these
wars
are
too
numerous
to
tell
but
one
of
my
greatest
privileges
as
president
is
to
get
to
know
the
stories
of
those
who
earn
the
medal
of
two
months
ago
presented
the
medal
to
the
parents
of
staff
sergeant
miller
who
gave
his
life
here
in
as
member
of
the
green
berets
his
charging
toward
some
insurgents
saved
the
lives
of
nearly
two
dozen
american
and
afghan
comrades
last
month
we
held
another
ceremony
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
years
the
recipient
of
the
medal
of
for
an
ongoing
conflict
was
actually
able
to
accept
it
in
person
his
name
is
staff
sergeant
and
some
of
you
may
have
seen
his
story
but
want
to
tell
it
again
tonight
because
of
what
it
says
not
just
about
our
armed
forces
but
also
what
it
says
about
the
country
that
we
love
so
three
years
ago
and
his
platoon
were
in
valley
when
their
patrol
was
ambushed
two
americans
lay
wounded
up
ahead
when
and
his
men
again
and
again
and
again
they
were
being
rained
down
with
fire
but
they
just
kept
because
they
wanted
to
get
their
two
buddies
and
when
he
saw
one
of
his
teammates
wounded
and
being
carried
away
by
insurgents
rushed
in
to
help
his
friends
despite
the
bullets
despite
the
danger
he
kept
on
pressing
forward
it
was
an
incredibly
intense
firefight
and
by
the
time
it
was
finished
every
single
member
of
that
platoon
had
shrapnel
or
bullet
hole
in
their
gear
five
were
wounded
and
two
had
given
their
lives
now
is
pretty
humble
guy
and
so
when
he
came
to
the
white
house
he
said
know
do
anything
he
said
he
was
just
doing
his
job
that
he
do
anything
that
his
brothers
have
done
for
him
hero
he
said
every
man
who
stands
around
me
every
woman
in
the
military
every
person
who
defends
this
country
is
also
and
right
each
of
you
has
your
own
story
each
of
you
is
writing
your
own
chapter
in
the
story
of
america
and
the
story
of
american
armed
forces
each
of
you
have
some
losses
each
of
you
have
made
sacrifices
you
come
from
every
conceivable
background
from
big
cities
and
small
towns
from
every
race
and
faith
and
station
come
together
to
serve
greater
cause
one
that
matters
to
the
citizens
of
your
country
back
home
and
to
strangers
who
live
world
away
so
make
no
mistake
through
your
service
you
demonstrate
the
content
of
the
american
character
is
right
every
single
one
of
you
is
hero
some
people
ask
whether
best
days
lie
ahead
or
whether
our
greatness
stretches
back
behind
us
in
the
stories
of
those
gone
before
and
when
look
out
at
all
of
you
know
the
answer
to
that
you
give
me
hope
you
give
me
inspiration
your
resolve
shows
that
americans
will
never
succumb
to
fear
your
selfless
service
shows
who
we
are
who
we
always
will
be
united
as
one
people
and
united
as
one
nation
for
you
embody
and
stand
up
for
the
values
that
make
us
what
we
are
as
people
america
is
not
defined
by
our
borders
we
are
defined
by
common
creed
in
this
holiday
season
worth
remembering
that
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
we
are
endowed
by
our
creator
by
certain
inalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
the
right
to
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
and
what
fighting
for
here
in
and
what
protecting
back
home
and
that
belief
is
more
powerful
than
any
adversary
so
we
may
face
tough
enemy
in
and
in
period
of
tough
challenges
back
home
but
we
did
not
become
the
nation
that
we
are
because
we
do
easy
as
americans
endured
and
grown
stronger
and
we
remain
the
land
of
the
free
only
because
we
are
also
home
of
the
brave
and
because
of
you
know
that
once
more
we
will
prevail
so
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
everybody
and
happy
new
year
thank
you
everybody
god
bless
you

be
seated

behalf
of

the
privileges
that
come

states

none
greater
than
serving
as
of
the
finest
military
that
the
world
has
ever
known
and
of
all
the
military
decorations
that
president
and

the
end
of
the
war
the
medal
of
has
been
awarded
nine
times
for
conspicuous
gallantry
in
an
ongoing
or
recent
conflict
sadly
our
nation
has
been
unable
to
present
this
decoration
to
the
recipients
themselves
because
each
gave
his
life
his
last
full
measure
of
devotion
for
our

that
he
is
including
his
lovely
wife
and
his
parents
and
rosemary
as
well
as
his
siblings
who
are
here
it
was
his
mother
after
all
who
apparently
taught
him
as
young
boy
in
how
to
remove
the
screen
from
his
bedroom
window
in
case
of
fire
what
she
know
was
that
by
teaching
how
to
jump
from
his
bedroom
and
sneaking
off
in
the
dead
of
night
she
was
unleashing
future
paratrooper
who
would
one
day
fight
in
the
rugged
mountains
of
miles
away
during
the
first
of
his
two
tours
of
duty
in
staff
sergeant
was
forced
early
on
to
come
to
terms
with
the
loss
of
comrades
and
friends
his
team
leader
at
the
time
gave
him
piece
of
advice
just
try
you
just
got
to
try
to
do
everything
you
can
when
your
time
to
do
just
got
to
try
to
do
everything
you
can
when
your
time
to
do
it
time
came
on
october
he
was
specialist
then
just
years
old
and
his
platoon
were
several
days
into
mission
in
the
valley
the
most
dangerous
valley
in
the
moon
was
full
the
light
it
cast
was
enough
to
travel
by
without
using
their
goggles
with
heavy
gear
on
their
backs
and
air
support
overhead
they
made
their
way
single
file
down
rocky
ridge
crest
along
terrain
so
steep
that
sliding
was
sometimes
easier
than
walking
they
quarter
mile
before
the
silence
was
shattered
it
was
an
ambush
so
close
that
the
cracks
of
the
guns
and
the
whizz
of
the
bullets
were
simultaneous
tracer
fire
hammered
the
ridge
at
hundreds
of
rounds
per
minute
said
later
the
stars
in
the
the
apache
gunships
above
saw
it
all
but
engage
with
the
enemy
so
close
to
our
soldiers
the
next
platoon
heard
the
shooting
but
were
too
far
away
to
join
the
fight
in
time
and
the
two
lead
men
were
hit
by
enemy
fire
and
knocked
down
instantly
when
the
third
was
struck
in
the
helmet
and
fell
to
the
ground
charged
headlong
into
the
wall
of
bullets
to
pull
him
to
safety
behind
what
little
cover
there
was
as
he
did
was
hit
twice
one
round
slamming
into
his
body
the
other
shattering
weapon
slung
across
his
back
they
were
pinned
down
and
two
wounded
americans
still
lay
up
ahead
so
and
his
comrades
regrouped
and
counterattacked
they
threw
grenades
using
the
explosions
as
cover
to
run
forward
shooting
at
the
muzzle
flashes
still
erupting
from
the
trees
then
they
did
it
again
and
again
throwing
grenades
charging
ahead
finally
they
reached
one
of
their
men
been
shot
twice
in
the
leg
but
he
had
kept
returning
fire
until
his
gun
jammed
as
another
soldier
tended
to
his
wounds
sprinted
ahead
at
every
step
meeting
relentless
enemy
fire
with
his
own
he
crested
hill
alone
with
no
cover
but
the
dust
kicked
up
by
the
storm
of
bullets
still
biting
into
the
ground
there
he
saw
chilling
sight
the
silhouettes
of
two
insurgents
carrying
the
other
wounded
american
away
who
happened
to
be
one
of
best
friends
never
broke
stride
he
leapt
forward
he
took
aim
he
killed
one
of
the
insurgents
and
wounded
the
other
who
ran
off
found
his
friend
alive
but
badly
wounded
had
saved
him
from
the
enemy
now
he
had
to
try
to
save
his
life
even
as
bullets
impacted
all
around
him
grabbed
his
friend
by
the
vest
and
dragged
him
to
cover
for
nearly
half
an
hour
worked
to
stop
the
bleeding
and
help
his
friend
breathe
until
the
arrived
to
lift
the
wounded
from
the
ridge
american
gunships
worked
to
clear
the
enemy
from
the
hills
and
with
the
battle
over
first
platoon
picked
up
their
gear
and
resumed
their
march
through
the
valley
they
continued
their
mission
it
had
been
as
intense
and
violent
firefight
as
any
soldier
will
experience
by
the
time
it
was
finished
every
member
of
first
platoon
had
shrapnel
or
bullet
hole
in
their
gear
five
were
wounded
and
two
gave
their
lives
friend
sergeant
joshua
and
the
platoon
medic
specialist
now
the
parents
of
joshua
and
are
here
today
and
know
that
there
are
no
words
that
even
three
years
later
can
ease
the
ache
in
your
hearts
or
repay
the
debt
that
america
owes
to
you
but
on
behalf
of
grateful
nation
let
me
express
profound
thanks
to
your
service
and
their
sacrifice
and
could
the
parents
of
joshua
and
please
stand
briefly
now
already
mentioned
like
this
guy
and
as
found
out
myself
when
first
spoke
with
him
on
the
phone
and
when
we
met
in
the
oval
office
today
he
is
guy
humble
guy
and
he
seek
the
limelight
and
tell
you
that
he
do
anything
special
that
he
was
just
doing
his
job
that
any
of
his
brothers
in
the
unit
would
do
the
same
thing
in
fact
he
just
lived
up
to
what
his
team
leader
instructed
him
to
do
years
before
do
everything
you
staff
sergeant
repeatedly
and
without
hesitation
you
charged
forward
through
extreme
enemy
fire
embodying
the
warrior
ethos
that
says
will
never
leave
fallen
your
actions
disrupted
devastating
ambush
before
it
could
claim
more
lives
your
courage
prevented
the
capture
of
an
american
soldier
and
brought
that
soldier
back
to
his
family
you
may
believe
that
you
deserve
this
but
it
was
your
fellow
soldiers
who
recommended
you
for
it
in
fact
your
commander
specifically
said
in
his
recommendation
that
you
lived
up
to
the
standards
of
the
most
decorated
american
soldier
of
world
war
who
famously
repelled
an
overwhelming
enemy
attack
by
himself
for
one
simple
reason
were
killing
my
why
risked
his
life
for
his
fellow
soldiers
because
they
would
risk
their
lives
for
him
what
his
bravery
not
just
the
urgent
impulse
to
have
their
backs
but
the
absolute
confidence
that
they
had
his
one
of
them
has
said
of
these
young
men
that
he
was
with
he
said
are
just
as
much
of
me
as
they
are
just
as
much
of
me
as
am
so
would
ask
team
all
of
battle
company
who
were
with
him
that
day
to
please
stand
and
be
as
well
gentlemen
thank
you
for
your
service
all
in
your
debt
and
proud
to
be
your
these
are
the
soldiers
of
our
armed
forces
highly
trained
each
with
roles
and
responsibilities
but
all
with
one
thing
in
common
they
volunteered
in
an
era
when
never
been
more
tempting
to
chase
personal
ambition
or
narrow
they
chose
the
opposite
they
felt
tug
they
answered
call
they
said
and
for
the
better
part
of
decade
they
have
endured
tour
after
tour
in
distant
and
difficult
places
they
have
protected
us
from
danger
they
have
given
others
the
opportunity
to
earn
better
and
more
secure
life
they
are
the
courageous
men
and
women
serving
in
even
as
we
speak
they
keep
clear
focus
on
their
mission
to
deny
safe
haven
for
terrorists
who
would
attack
our
country
to
break
the
back
of
the
insurgency
to
build
the
capacity
to
defend
themselves
they
possess
the
steely
resolve
to
see
their
mission
through
they
are
made
of
the
same
strong
stuff
as
the
troops
in
this
room
and
am
absolutely
confident
that
they
will
continue
to
succeed
in
the
missions
that
we
give
them
in
and
beyond
after
all
our
brave
servicemen
and
women
and
their
families
have
done
everything
been
asked
to
do
they
have
been
everything
that
we
have
asked
them
to
be
am
hero
has
said
every
man
who
stands
around
me
every
woman
in
the
military
every
person
who
defends
this
country
and
right
this
medal
today
is
testament
to
his
uncommon
but
also
to
the
parents
and
the
community
that
raised
him
the
military
that
trained
him
and
all
the
men
and
women
who
served
by
his
side
all
of
them
deserve
our
enduring
thanks
and
gratitude
they
represent
small
fraction
of
the
american
population
but
they
and
the
families
who
await
their
safe
return
carry
far
more
than
their
fair
share
of
our
burden
they
fight
halfway
around
the
globe
but
they
do
it
in
hopes
that
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
have
to
they
are
the
very
best
part
of
us
they
are
our
friends
our
family
our
our
classmates
our
coworkers

are
why
our
banner

shine

the
people

back

am
so
glad
that
made
it
back
to
and
that
was
able
to
join
me
we
had
couple
of
false
starts
this
year
but
was
determined
to
visit
country
meant
so
much
to
me
and
unfortunately
this
visit
is
too
short
but
look
forward
to
coming
back
year
from
now
when
hosts
the
east
asia
summit
before
go
any
further
want
to
say
that
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
all
of
those
who
are
affected
by
the
recent
tsunami
and
the
volcanic
eruptions
particularly
those
lost
loved
ones
and
those
been
displaced
and
want
you
all
to
know

as
always
the

natural

we
are
pleased
to
be
able
to

as

as
help
and
families
take
in
the
displaced
know
that
the
strength
and
the
resilience
of
the
people
will
pull
you
through
once
more
let
me
begin
with
simple
statement
first
came
to
this
country
when
my
mother
married
an
named
and
as
young
boy
was
as
young
boy
was
coming
to
different
world
but
the
people
of
quickly
made
me
feel
at
home
jakarta
now
jakarta
looked
very
different
in
those
days
the
city
was
filled
with
buildings
that
were
no
more
than
few
stories
tall
this
was
back
in
most
of
you
born
yet
the
hotel
was
one
of
the
few
high
rises
and
there
was
just
one
big
department
store
called
that
was
it
and
how
you
got
around
they
outnumbered
in
those
days
and
you
have
all
the
big
highways
that
you
have
today
most
of
them
gave
way
to
unpaved
roads
and
the
so
we
moved
to
where
hey
some
folks
from
right
here
and
we
lived
in
small
house
we
had
mango
tree
out
front
and
learned
to
love
while
flying
kites
and
running
along
the
paddy
fields
and
catching
dragonflies
buying
and
from
the
street
vendors
still
remember
the
call
of
the
vendors
remember
that
but
most
of
all
remember
the
people
the
old
men
and
women
who
welcomed
us
with
smiles
the
children
who
made
foreign
child
feel
like
and
friend
and
the
teachers
who
helped
me
learn
about
this
country
because
is
made
up
of
thousands
of
islands
and
hundreds
of
languages
and
people
from
scores
of
regions
and
ethnic
groups
my
time
here
helped
me
appreciate
the
common
humanity
of
all
people
and
while
my
stepfather
like
most
was
raised
muslim
he
firmly
believed
that
all
religions
were
worthy
of
respect
and
in
this
way
in
this
way
he
reflected
the
spirit
of
religious
tolerance
that
is
enshrined
in
constitution
and
that
remains
one
of
this
defining
and
inspiring
characteristics
now
stayed
here
for
four
years
time
that
helped
shape
my
childhood
time
that
saw
the
birth
of
my
wonderful
sister
maya
time
that
made
such
an
impression
on
my
mother
that
she
kept
returning
to
over
the
next
years
to
live
and
to
work
and
to
travel
and
to
pursue
her
passion
of
promoting
opportunity
in
villages
especially
opportunity
for
women
and
for
girls
and
was
so
was
so
when
president
last
night
at
the
state
dinner
presented
an
award
on
behalf
of
my
mother
the
work
that
she
did
and
she
would
have
been
so
proud
because
my
mother
held
and
its
people
very
close
to
her
heart
for
her
entire
life
so
much
has
changed
in
the
four
decades
since
boarded
plane
to
move
back
to
hawaii
if
you
asked
me
or
any
of
my
schoolmates
who
knew
me
back
then
think
any
of
us
could
have
anticipated
that
one
day
would
come
back
to
jakarta
as
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
few
could
have
anticipated
the
remarkable
story
of
over
these
last
four
decades
the
jakarta
that
once
knew
has
grown
into
teeming
city
of
nearly
million
with
skyscrapers
that
dwarf
the
hotel
and
thriving
of
culture
and
of
commerce
while
my
friends
and
used
to
run
in
fields
with
water
buffalo
and
goats
new
generation
of
is
among
the
most
wired
in
the
world
connected
through
cell
phones
and
social
networks
and
while
as
young
nation
focused
inward
growing
now
plays
key
role
in
the
asia
pacific
and
in
the
global
economy
now
this
change
also
extends
to
politics
when
my
stepfather
was
boy
he
watched
his
own
father
and
older
brother
leave
home
to
fight
and
die
in
the
struggle
for
independence
and
happy
to
be
here
on
day
to
the
memory
of
so
many
who
have
sacrificed
on
behalf
of
this
great
country
when
moved
to
jakarta
it
was
and
it
was
time
that
had
followed
great
suffering
and
conflict
in
parts
of
this
country
and
even
though
my
stepfather
had
served
in
the
army
the
violence
and
killing
during
that
time
of
political
upheaval
was
largely
unknown
to
me
because
it
was
unspoken
by
my
family
and
friends
in
my
household
like
so
many
others
across
the
memories
of
that
time
were
an
invisible
presence
had
their
independence
but
they
were
afraid
to
speak
their
minds
about
issues
in
the
years
since
then
has
charted
its
own
course
through
an
extraordinary
democratic
transformation
from
the
rule
of
an
iron
fist
to
the
rule
of
the
people
in
recent
years
the
world
has
watched
with
hope
and
admiration
as
embraced
the
peaceful
transfer
of
power
and
the
direct
election
of
leaders
and
just
as
your
democracy
is
by
your
elected
president
and
legislature
your
democracy
is
sustained
and
fortified
by
its
checks
and
balances
dynamic
civil
society
political
parties
and
unions
vibrant
media
and
engaged
citizens
who
have
ensured
that
in
there
will
be
no
turning
back
from
democracy
but
even
as
this
land
of
my
youth
has
changed
in
so
many
ways
those
things
that
learned
to
love
about
that
spirit
of
tolerance
that
is
written
into
your
constitution
in
mosques
and
churches
and
temples
standing
alongside
each
other
that
spirit
embodied
in
your
people
that
still
lives
on
unity
in
diversity
this
is
the
foundation
of
example
to
the
world
and
this
is
why
will
play
such
an
important
part
in
the
century
so
today
return
to
as
friend
but
also
as
president
who
seeks
deep
and
enduring
partnership
between
our
two
countries
because
as
vast
and
diverse
countries
as
on
either
side
of
the
pacific
and
above
all
as
democracies
the
united
states
and
are
bound
together
by
shared
interests
and
shared
values
yesterday
president
and
announced
new
comprehensive
partnership
between
the
united
states
and
we
are
increasing
ties
between
our
governments
in
many
different
areas
and
just
as
importantly
we
are
increasing
ties
among
our
people
this
is
partnership
of
equals
grounded
in
mutual
interests
and
mutual
respect
so
with
the
rest
of
my
time
today
like
to
talk
about
why
the
story
just
told
the
story
of
since
the
days
when
lived
here
is
so
important
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
world
will
focus
on
three
areas
that
are
closely
related
and
fundamental
to
human
progress
development
democracy
and
religious
faith
first
the
friendship
between
the
united
states
and
can
advance
our
mutual
interest
in
development
when
moved
to
it
would
have
been
hard
to
imagine
future
in
which
the
prosperity
of
families
in
chicago
and
jakarta
would
be
connected
but
our
economies
are
now
global
and
have
experienced
both
the
promise
and
the
perils
of
from
the
shock
of
the
asian
financial
crisis
in
the
to
the
millions
lifted
out
of
poverty
because
of
increased
trade
and
commerce
what
that
means
and
what
we
learned
in
the
recent
economic
crisis
is
that
we
have
stake
in
each
success
america
has
stake
in
growing
and
developing
with
prosperity
that
is
broadly
shared
among
the
people
because
rising
middle
class
here
in
means
new
markets
for
our
goods
just
as
america
is
market
for
goods
coming
from
so
we
are
investing
more
in
and
our
exports
have
grown
by
nearly
percent
and
we
are
opening
doors
for
americans
and
to
do
business
with
one
another
america
has
stake
in
an
that
plays
its
rightful
role
in
shaping
the
global
economy
gone
are
the
days
when
seven
or
eight
countries
would
come
together
to
determine
the
direction
of
global
markets
why
the
is
now
the
of
international
economic
cooperation
so
that
emerging
economies
like
have
greater
voice
and
also
bear
greater
responsibility
for
guiding
the
global
economy
and
through
its
leadership
of
the
group
should
lead
on
the
world
stage
and
by
example
in
embracing
transparency
and
accountability
america
has
stake
in
an
that
pursues
sustainable
development
because
the
way
we
grow
will
determine
the
quality
of
our
lives
and
the
health
of
our
planet
and
why
developing
clean
energy
technologies
that
can
power
industry
and
preserve
precious
natural
resources
and
america
welcomes
your
strong
leadership
in
the
global
effort
to
combat
climate
change
above
all
america
has
stake
in
the
success
of
the
people
underneath
the
headlines
of
the
day
we
must
build
bridges
between
our
people
because
our
future
security
and
prosperity
is
shared
and
that
is
exactly
what
doing
by
increasing
collaboration
among
our
scientists
and
researchers
and
by
working
together
to
foster
entrepreneurship
and
especially
pleased
that
we
have
committed
to
double
the
number
of
american
and
students
studying
in
our
respective
countries
we
want
more
students
in
american
schools
and
we
want
more
american
students
to
come
study
in
this
country
we
want
to
forge
new
ties
and
greater
understanding
between
young
people
in
this
young
century
these
are
the
issues
that
really
matter
in
our
daily
lives
development
after
all
is
not
simply
about
growth
rates
and
numbers
on
balance
sheet
about
whether
child
can
learn
the
skills
they
need
to
make
it
in
changing
world
about
whether
good
idea
is
allowed
to
grow
into
business
and
not
suffocated
by
corruption
about
whether
those
forces
that
have
transformed
the
jakarta
once
knew
technology
and
trade
and
the
flow
of
people
and
goods
can
translate
into
better
life
for
all
for
all
human
beings
life
marked
by
dignity
and
opportunity
now
this
kind
of
development
is
inseparable
from
the
role
of
democracy
today
we
sometimes
hear
that
democracy
stands
in
the
way
of
economic
progress
this
is
not
new
argument
particularly
in
times
of
change
and
economic
uncertainty
some
will
say
that
it
is
easier
to
take
shortcut
to
development
by
trading
away
the
right
of
human
beings
for
the
power
of
the
state
but
not
what
saw
on
my
trip
to
india
and
that
is
not
what
see
here
in
your
achievements
demonstrate
that
democracy
and
development
reinforce
one
another
like
any
democracy
you
have
known
setbacks
along
the
way
america
is
no
different
our
own
constitution
spoke
of
the
effort
to
forge
perfect
union
and
that
is
journey
that
ever
since
endured
civil
war
and
we
struggled
to
extend
equal
rights
to
all
of
our
citizens
but
it
is
precisely
this
effort
that
has
allowed
us
to
become
stronger
and
more
prosperous
while
also
becoming
more
just
and
more
free
society
like
other
countries
that
emerged
from
colonial
rule
in
the
last
century
struggled
and
sacrificed
for
the
right
to
determine
your
destiny
that
is
what
day
is
all
about
an
that
belongs
to
but
you
also
ultimately
decided
that
freedom
can
not
mean
replacing
the
strong
hand
of
with
strongman
of
your
own
of
course
democracy
is
messy
not
everyone
likes
the
results
of
every
election
you
go
through
your
ups
and
downs
but
the
journey
is
worthwhile
and
it
goes
beyond
casting
ballot
it
takes
strong
institutions
to
check
the
power
the
concentration
of
power
it
takes
open
markets
to
allow
individuals
to
thrive
it
takes
free
press
and
an
independent
justice
system
to
root
out
abuses
and
excess
and
to
insist
on
accountability
it
takes
open
society
and
active
citizens
to
reject
inequality
and
injustice
these
are
the
forces
that
will
propel
forward
and
it
will
require
refusal
to
tolerate
the
corruption
that
stands
in
the
way
of
opportunity
commitment
to
transparency
that
gives
every
stake
in
their
government
and
belief
that
the
freedom
of
that
have
fought
for
is
what
holds
this
great
nation
together
that
is
the
message
of
the
who
have
advanced
this
democratic
story
from
those
who
fought
in
the
battle
of
years
ago
today
to
the
students
who
marched
peacefully
for
democracy
in
the
to
leaders
who
have
embraced
the
peaceful
transition
of
power
in
this
young
century
because
ultimately
it
will
be
the
rights
of
citizens
that
will
stitch
together
this
remarkable
that
stretches
from
to
an
insistence
an
insistence
that
every
child
born
in
this
country
should
be
treated
equally
whether
they
come
from
java
or
from
bali
or
papua
that
all
have
equal
rights
that
effort
extends
to
the
example
that
is
now
setting
abroad
took
the
initiative
to
establish
the
bali
democracy
forum
an
open
forum
for
countries
to
share
their
experiences
and
best
practices
in
fostering
democracy
has
also
been
at
the
forefront
of
pushing
for
more
attention
to
human
rights
within
the
nations
of
asia
must
have
the
right
to
determine
their
own
destiny
and
the
united
states
will
strongly
support
that
right
but
the
people
of
asia
must
have
the
right
to
determine
their
own
destiny
as
well
and
why
we
condemned
elections
in
burma
recently
that
were
neither
free
nor
fair
that
is
why
we
are
supporting
your
vibrant
civil
society
in
working
with
counterparts
across
this
region
because
no
reason
why
respect
for
human
rights
should
stop
at
the
border
of
any
country
hand
in
hand
that
is
what
development
and
democracy
are
about
the
notion
that
certain
values
are
universal
prosperity
without
freedom
is
just
another
form
of
poverty
because
there
are
aspirations
that
human
beings
share
the
liberty
of
knowing
that
your
leader
is
accountable
to
you
and
that
you
be
locked
up
for
disagreeing
with
them
the
opportunity
to
get
an
education
and
to
be
able
to
work
with
dignity
the
freedom
to
practice
your
faith
without
fear
or
restriction
those
are
universal
values
that
must
be
observed
everywhere
now
religion
is
the
final
topic
that
want
to
address
today
and
like
democracy
and
development
it
is
fundamental
to
the
story
like
the
other
asian
nations
that
visiting
on
this
trip
is
steeped
in
spirituality
place
where
people
worship
god
in
many
different
ways
along
with
this
rich
diversity
it
is
also
home
to
the
largest
muslim
population
truth
came
to
know
as
boy
when
heard
the
call
to
prayer
across
jakarta
just
as
individuals
are
not
defined
solely
by
their
faith
is
defined
by
more
than
its
muslim
population
but
we
also
know
that
relations
between
the
united
states
and
muslim
communities
have
frayed
over
many
years
as
president
have
made
it
priority
to
begin
to
repair
these
relations
as
part
of
that
effort
went
to
cairo
last
june
and
called
for
new
beginning
between
the
united
states
and
muslims
around
the
world
one
that
creates
path
for
us
to
move
beyond
our
differences
said
then
and
will
repeat
now
that
no
single
can
eradicate
years
of
mistrust
but
believed
then
and
believe
today
that
we
do
have
choice
we
can
choose
to
be
defined
by
our
differences
and
give
in
to
future
of
suspicion
and
mistrust
or
we
can
choose
to
do
the
hard
work
of
forging
common
ground
and
commit
ourselves
to
the
steady
pursuit
of
progress
and
can
promise
you
no
matter
what
setbacks
may
come
the
united
states
is
committed
to
human
progress
that
is
who
we
are
that
is
what
done
and
that
is
what
we
will
do
now
we
know
well
the
issues
that
have
caused
tensions
for
many
years
and
these
are
issues
that
addressed
in
cairo
in
the
months
that
have
passed
since
that
we
have
made
some
progress
but
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
innocent
civilians
in
america
in
and
across
the
world
are
still
targeted
by
violent
extremism
made
clear
that
america
is
not
and
never
will
be
at
war
with
islam
instead
all
of
us
must
work
together
to
defeat
and
its
affiliates
who
have
no
claim
to
be
leaders
of
any
religion
certainly
not
great
world
religion
like
islam
but
those
who
want
to
build
must
not
cede
ground
to
terrorists
who
seek
to
destroy
and
this
is
not
task
for
america
alone
indeed
here
in
made
progress
in
rooting
out
extremists
and
combating
such
violence
in
we
continue
to
work
with
coalition
of
nations
to
build
the
capacity
of
the
afghan
government
to
secure
its
future
our
shared
interest
is
in
building
peace
in
land
peace
that
provides
no
safe
haven
for
violent
extremists
and
that
provide
hope
for
the
afghan
people
meanwhile
made
progress
on
one
of
our
core
commitments
our
effort
to
end
the
war
in
iraq
nearly
american
troops
have
now
left
iraq
under
my
presidency
iraqis
have
taken
full
responsibility
for
their
security
and
we
will
continue
to
support
iraq
as
it
forms
an
inclusive
government
and
we
will
bring
all
of
our
troops
home
in
the
middle
east
we
have
faced
false
starts
and
setbacks
but
been
persistent
in
our
pursuit
of
peace
israelis
and
restarted
direct
talks
but
enormous
obstacles
remain
there
should
be
no
illusion
that
peace
and
security
will
come
easy
but
let
there
be
no
doubt
america
will
spare
no
effort
in
working
for
the
outcome
that
is
just
and
that
is
in
the
interests
of
all
the
parties
involved
two
states
israel
and
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
that
is
our
goal
the
stakes
are
high
in
resolving
all
of
these
issues
for
our
world
has
grown
smaller
and
while
those
forces
that
connect
us
have
unleashed
opportunity
and
great
wealth
they
also
empower
those
who
seek
to
derail
progress
one
bomb
in
marketplace
can
obliterate
the
bustle
of
daily
commerce
one
whispered
can
obscure
the
truth
and
set
off
violence
between
communities
that
once
lived
together
in
peace
in
an
age
of
rapid
change
and
colliding
cultures
what
we
share
as
human
beings
can
sometimes
be
lost
but
believe
that
the
history
of
both
america
and
should
give
us
hope
it
is
story
written
into
our
national
in
the
united
states
our
motto
is
out
of
many
one
unity
in
diversity
we
are
two
nations
which
have
different
paths
yet
our
nations
show
that
hundreds
of
millions
who
hold
different
beliefs
can
be
united
in
freedom
under
one
flag
and
we
are
now
building
on
that
shared
humanity
through
young
people
who
will
study
in
each
schools
through
the
entrepreneurs
forging
ties
that
can
lead
to
greater
prosperity
and
through
our
embrace
of
fundamental
democratic
values
and
human
aspirations
before
came
here
visited
mosque
place
of
worship
that
was
still
under
construction
when
lived
in
jakarta
and
admired
its
soaring
minaret
and
its
imposing
dome
and
welcoming
space
but
its
name
and
history
also
speak
to
what
makes
great
means
independence
and
its
construction
was
in
part
testament
to
the
struggle
for
freedom
moreover
this
house
of
worship
for
many
thousands
of
muslims
was
designed
by
christian
architect
such
is
spirit
such
is
the
message
of
inclusive
philosophy
across
an
archipelago
that
contains
some
of
most
beautiful
creations
islands
rising
above
an
ocean
named
for
peace
people
choose
to
worship
god
as
they
please
islam
flourishes
but
so
do
other
faiths
development
is
strengthened
by
an
emerging
democracy
ancient
traditions
endure
even
as
rising
power
is
on
the
move
that
is
not
to
say
that
is
without
imperfections
no
country
is
but
here
we
can
find
the
ability
to
bridge
divides
of
race
and
region
and
religion
by
the
ability
to
see
yourself
in
other
people
as
child
of
different
race
who
came
here
from
distant
country
found
this
spirit
in
the
greeting
that
received
upon
moving
here
as
christian
visiting
mosque
on
this
visit
found
it
in
the
words
of
leader
who
was
asked
about
my
visit
and
said
are
also
allowed
in
churches
we
are
all
that
spark
of
the
divine
lives
within
each
of
us
we
can
not
give
in
to
doubt
or
cynicism
or
despair
the
stories
of
and
america
should
make
us
optimistic
because
it
tells
us
that
history
is
on
the
side
of
human
progress
that
unity
is
more
powerful
than
division
and
that
the
people
of
this
world
can
live
together
in
peace
may
our
two
nations
working
together
with
faith
and
determination
share
these
truths
with
all
mankind
in
conclusion
would
like
say
thank
you
to
all
thank
you
for
your
assistance
thank
you
peace
be
upon
you
thank

long
years
is
finally
coming
to
an
end
tonight
this
chamber
speaks
with
one
voice
to
the
people
we
represent
it
is
you
our
citizens
who
make
the
state
of
our
union
strong
here
are
the
results
of
your
efforts
the
lowest

for

since

than
we
buy
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
first
time
that
happened
in
nearly
twenty
years
our
deficits
cut
by
more
than
half
and
for
the
first
time
in
over
decade
business
leaders
around
the
world
have
declared
that
china
is
no
longer
the
world
number
one
place
to
invest
america
is
that
why
believe
this
can
be
breakthrough
year
for
america
after
five
years
of
grit
and
determined
effort
the
united
states
is
for
the
century
than
any
other
nation
on
earth
the
question
for
everyone
in
this
chamber
running
through
every
decision
we
make
this
year
is
whether
we
are
going
to
help
or
hinder
this
progress
for
several
years
now
this
town
has
been
consumed
by
rancorous
argument
over
the
proper
size
of
the
federal
government
it
an
important
debate
one
that
dates
back
to
our
very
founding
but
when
that
debate
prevents
us
from
carrying
out
even
the
most
basic
functions
of
our
democracy
when
our
differences
shut
down
government
or
threaten
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states
then
we
are
not
doing
right
by
the
american
people
as
president
committed
to
making
washington
work
better
and
rebuilding
the
trust
of
the
people
who
sent
us
here
believe
most
of
you
are
too
last
month
thanks
to
the
work
of
democrats
and
republicans
this
congress
finally
produced
budget
that
some
of
last
year
severe
cuts
to
priorities
like
education
nobody
got
everything
they
wanted
and
we
can
still
do
more
to
invest
in
this
country
future
while
bringing
down
our
deficit
in
balanced
way
but
the
budget
compromise
should
leave
us
freer
to
focus
on
creating
new
jobs
not
creating
new
crises
in
the
coming
months
let
see
where
else
we
can
make
progress
together
let
make
this
year
of
action
that
what
most
americans
want
for
all
of
us
in
this
chamber
to
focus
on
their
lives
their
hopes
their
aspirations
and
what
believe
unites
the
people
of
this
nation
regardless
of
race
or
region
or
party
young
or
old
rich
or
poor
is
the
simple
profound
belief
in
opportunity
for
all
the
notion
that
if
you
work
hard
and
take
responsibility
you
can
get
ahead
let
face
it
that
belief
has
suffered
some
serious
blows
over
more
than
three
decades
even
before
the
great
recession
hit
massive
shifts
in
technology
and
global
competition
had
eliminated
lot
of
good
jobs
and
weakened
the
economic
foundations
that
families
depend
on
today
after
four
years
of
economic
growth
corporate
profits
and
stock
prices
have
rarely
been
higher
and
those
at
the
top
have
never
done
better
but
average
wages
have
barely
budged
inequality
has
deepened
upward
mobility
has
stalled
the
cold
hard
fact
is
that
even
in
the
midst
of
recovery
too
many
americans
are
working
more
than
ever
just
to
get
by
let
alone
get
ahead
and
too
many
still
are
working
at
all
our
job
is
to
reverse
these
trends
it
happen
right
away
and
we
agree
on
everything
but
what
offer
tonight
is
set
of
concrete
practical
proposals
to
speed
up
growth
strengthen
the
middle
class
and
build
new
ladders
of
opportunity
into
the
middle
class
some
require
congressional
action
and
eager
to
work
with
all
of
you
but
america
does
not
stand
still
and
neither
will
so
wherever
and
whenever
can
take
steps
without
legislation
to
expand
opportunity
for
more
american
families
that
what
going
to
do
as
usual
our
first
lady
sets
good
example
let
move
partnership
with
schools
businesses
and
local
leaders
has
helped
bring
down
childhood
obesity
rates
for
the
first
time
in
thirty
years
an
achievement
that
will
improve
lives
and
reduce
health
care
costs
for
decades
to
come
the
joining
forces
alliance
that
and
launched
has
already
encouraged
employers
to
hire
or
train
nearly
veterans
and
military
spouses
taking
page
from
that
the
white
house
just
college
opportunity
summit
where
already
universities
businesses
and
have
made
concrete
commitments
to
reduce
inequality
in
access
to
higher
education
and
help
every
hardworking
kid
go
to
college
and
succeed
when
they
get
to
campus
across
the
country
we
partnering
with
mayors
governors
and
state
legislatures
on
issues
from
homelessness
to
marriage
equality
the
point
is
there
are
millions
of
americans
outside
washington
who
are
tired
of
stale
political
arguments
and
are
moving
this
country
forward
they
believe
and
believe
that
here
in
america
our
success
should
depend
not
on
accident
of
birth
but
the
strength
of
our
work
ethic
and
the
scope
of
our
dreams
that
what
drew
our
forebears
here
it
how
the
daughter
of
factory
worker
is
of
america
largest
how
the
son
of
is
speaker
of
the
house
how
the
son
of
single
mom
can
be
president
of
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
opportunity
is
who
we
are
and
the
defining
project
of
our
generation
is
to
restore
that
promise
we
know
where
to
start
the
best
measure
of
opportunity
is
access
to
good
job
with
the
economy
picking
up
speed
companies
say
they
intend
to
hire
more
people
this
year
and
over
half
of
big
manufacturers
say
they
thinking
of
jobs
from
abroad
so
let
make
that
decision
easier
for
more
companies
both
democrats
and
republicans
have
argued
that
our
tax
code
is
riddled
with
wasteful
complicated
loopholes
that
punish
businesses
investing
here
and
reward
companies
that
keep
profits
abroad
let
flip
that
equation
let
work
together
to
close
those
loopholes
end
those
incentives
to
ship
jobs
overseas
and
lower
tax
rates
for
businesses
that
create
jobs
here
at
home
moreover
we
can
take
the
money
we
save
with
this
transition
to
tax
reform
to
create
jobs
rebuilding
our
roads
upgrading
our
ports
our
commutes
because
in
today
global
economy
jobs
gravitate
to
infrastructure
we
need
congress
to
protect
more
than
three
million
jobs
by
finishing
transportation
and
waterways
bills
this
summer
but
will
act
on
my
own
to
slash
bureaucracy
and
streamline
the
permitting
process
for
key
projects
so
we
can
get
more
construction
workers
on
the
job
as
fast
as
possible
we
also
have
the
chance
right
now
to
beat
other
countries
in
the
race
for
the
next
wave
of
manufacturing
jobs
my
administration
has
launched
two
hubs
for
manufacturing
in
and
where
we
connected
businesses
to
research
universities
that
can
help
america
lead
the
world
in
advanced
technologies
tonight
announcing
we
launch
six
more
this
year
bipartisan
bills
in
both
houses
could
double
the
number
of
these
hubs
and
the
jobs
they
create
so
get
those
bills
to
my
desk
and
put
more
americans
back
to
work
let
do
more
to
help
the
entrepreneurs
and
small
business
owners
who
create
most
new
jobs
in
america
over
the
past
five
years
my
administration
has
made
more
loans
to
small
business
owners
than
any
other
and
when
percent
of
our
exporters
are
small
businesses
new
trade
partnerships
with
europe
and
the
will
help
them
create
more
jobs
we
need
to
work
together
on
tools
like
bipartisan
trade
promotion
authority
to
protect
our
workers
protect
our
environment
and
open
new
markets
to
new
goods
stamped
made
in
the
china
and
europe
are
standing
on
the
sidelines
neither
should
we
we
know
that
the
nation
that
goes
on
innovation
today
will
own
the
global
economy
tomorrow
this
is
an
edge
america
can
not
surrender
research
helped
lead
to
the
ideas
and
inventions
behind
and
that
why
congress
should
undo
the
damage
done
by
last
year
cuts
to
basic
research
so
we
can
unleash
the
next
great
american
discovery
whether
it
vaccines
that
stay
ahead
of
bacteria
or
material
that
stronger
than
steel
and
let
pass
patent
reform
bill
that
allows
our
businesses
to
stay
focused
on
innovation
not
costly
needless
litigation
now
one
of
the
biggest
factors
in
bringing
more
jobs
back
is
our
commitment
to
american
energy
the
energy
strategy
announced
few
years
ago
is
working
and
today
america
is
closer
to
energy
independence
than
we
been
in
decades
one
of
the
reasons
why
is
natural
gas
if
extracted
safely
it
the
bridge
fuel
that
can
power
our
economy
with
less
of
the
carbon
pollution
that
causes
climate
change
businesses
plan
to
invest
almost
billion
in
new
factories
that
use
natural
gas
cut
red
tape
to
help
states
get
those
factories
built
and
this
congress
can
help
by
putting
people
to
work
building
stations
that
shift
more
cars
and
trucks
from
foreign
oil
to
american
natural
gas
my
administration
will
keep
working
with
the
industry
to
sustain
production
and
job
growth
while
strengthening
protection
of
our
air
our
water
and
our
communities
and
while
we
at
it
use
my
authority
to
protect
more
of
our
pristine
federal
lands
for
future
generations
it
not
just
oil
and
natural
gas
production
that
booming
we
becoming
global
leader
in
solar
too
every
four
minutes
another
american
home
or
business
goes
solar
every
panel
pounded
into
place
by
worker
whose
job
be
let
continue
that
progress
with
smarter
tax
policy
that
stops
giving
billion
year
to
fossil
fuel
industries
that
do
need
it
so
that
we
can
invest
more
in
fuels
of
the
future
that
do
and
even
as
we
increased
energy
production
we
partnered
with
businesses
builders
and
local
communities
to
reduce
the
energy
we
consume
when
we
rescued
our
for
example
we
worked
with
them
to
set
higher
fuel
efficiency
standards
for
our
cars
in
the
coming
months
build
on
that
success
by
setting
new
standards
for
our
trucks
so
we
can
keep
driving
down
oil
imports
and
what
we
pay
at
the
pump
taken
together
our
energy
policy
is
creating
jobs
and
leading
to
cleaner
safer
planet
over
the
past
eight
years
the
united
states
has
reduced
our
total
carbon
pollution
more
than
any
other
nation
on
earth
but
we
have
to
act
with
more
urgency
because
changing
climate
is
already
harming
western
communities
struggling
with
drought
and
coastal
cities
dealing
with
floods
that
why
directed
my
administration
to
work
with
states
utilities
and
others
to
set
new
standards
on
the
amount
of
carbon
pollution
our
power
plants
are
allowed
to
dump
into
the
air
the
shift
to
cleaner
energy
economy
happen
overnight
and
it
will
require
tough
choices
along
the
way
but
the
debate
is
settled
climate
change
is
fact
and
when
our
children
children
look
us
in
the
eye
and
ask
if
we
did
all
we
could
to
leave
them
safer
more
stable
world
with
new
sources
of
energy
want
us
to
be
able
to
say
yes
we
did
finally
if
we
are
serious
about
economic
growth
it
is
time
to
heed
the
call
of
business
leaders
leaders
faith
leaders
and
law
enforcement
and
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
republicans
and
democrats
in
the
senate
have
acted
know
that
members
of
both
parties
in
the
house
want
to
do
the
same
independent
economists
say
immigration
reform
will
grow
our
economy
and
shrink
our
deficits
by
almost
trillion
in
the
next
two
decades
and
for
good
reason
when
people
come
here
to
their
dreams
to
study
invent
and
contribute
to
our
culture
they
make
our
country
more
attractive
place
for
businesses
to
locate
and
create
jobs
for
everyone
so
let
get
immigration
reform
done
this
year
the
ideas
outlined
so
far
can
speed
up
growth
and
create
more
jobs
but
in
this
economy
we
have
to
make
sure
that
every
american
has
the
skills
to
fill
those
jobs
the
good
news
is
we
know
how
to
do
it
two
years
ago
as
the
auto
industry
came
roaring
back
rush
opened
up
manufacturing
firm
in
detroit
she
knew
that
ford
needed
parts
for
the
truck
in
america
and
she
knew
how
to
make
them
she
just
needed
the
workforce
so
she
up
what
we
call
an
american
job
places
where
folks
can
walk
in
to
get
the
help
or
training
they
need
to
find
new
job
or
better
job
she
was
flooded
with
new
workers
and
today
detroit
manufacturing
systems
has
more
than
employees
what
and
her
employees
experienced
is
how
it
should
be
for
every
employer
and
every
job
seeker
so
tonight
asked
vice
president
to
lead
an
reform
of
america
training
programs
to
make
sure
they
have
one
mission
train
americans
with
the
skills
employers
need
and
match
them
to
good
jobs
that
need
to
be
filled
right
now
that
means
more
training
and
more
apprenticeships
that
set
young
worker
on
an
upward
trajectory
for
life
it
means
connecting
companies
to
community
colleges
that
can
help
design
training
to
fill
their
specific
needs
and
if
congress
wants
to
help
you
can
concentrate
funding
on
proven
programs
that
connect
more
americans
with
jobs
also
convinced
we
can
help
americans
return
to
the
workforce
faster
by
reforming
unemployment
insurance
so
that
it
more
effective
in
today
economy
but
first
this
congress
needs
to
restore
the
unemployment
insurance
you
just
let
expire
for
million
people
let
me
tell
you
why
misty
is
mother
of
two
young
boys
she
been
steadily
employed
since
she
was
teenager
she
put
herself
through
college
she
never
collected
unemployment
benefits
in
may
she
and
her
husband
used
their
life
savings
to
buy
their
first
home
week
later
budget
cuts
claimed
the
job
she
loved
last
month
when
their
unemployment
insurance
was
cut
off
she
sat
down
and
wrote
me
letter
the
kind
get
every
day
we
are
the
face
of
the
unemployment
crisis
she
wrote
am
not
dependent
on
the
country
depends
on
people
like
us
who
build
careers
contribute
to
about
our
am
confident
that
in
time
will
find
will
pay
my
taxes
and
we
will
raise
our
children
in
their
own
home
in
the
community
we
love
please
give
us
this
chance
congress
give
these
hardworking
responsible
americans
that
chance
they
need
our
help
but
more
important
this
country
needs
them
in
the
game
that
why
been
asking
to
give
more
unemployed
workers
fair
shot
at
that
new
job
and
new
chance
to
support
their
families
this
week
many
will
come
to
the
white
house
to
make
that
commitment
real
tonight
ask
every
business
leader
in
america
to
join
us
and
to
do
the
same
because
we
are
stronger
when
america
fields
full
team
of
course
it
not
enough
to
train
today
workforce
we
also
have
to
prepare
tomorrow
workforce
by
guaranteeing
every
child
access
to
education
could
speak
word
of
english
when
he
moved
to
new
york
city
at
age
nine
but
last
month
thanks
to
the
support
of
great
teachers
and
an
innovative
tutoring
program
he
led
march
of
his
classmates
through
crowd
of
cheering
parents
and
from
their
high
school
to
the
post
office
where
they
mailed
off
their
college
applications
and
this
son
of
factory
worker
just
found
out
he
going
to
college
this
fall
five
years
ago
we
set
out
to
change
the
odds
for
all
our
kids
we
worked
with
lenders
to
reform
student
loans
and
today
more
young
people
are
earning
college
degrees
than
ever
before
race
to
the
top
with
the
help
of
governors
from
both
parties
has
helped
states
raise
expectations
and
performance
teachers
and
principals
in
schools
from
to
washington
are
making
big
strides
in
preparing
students
with
skills
for
the
new
economy
problem
solving
critical
thinking
science
technology
engineering
and
math
some
of
this
change
is
hard
it
requires
everything
from
more
challenging
and
more
demanding
parents
to
better
support
for
teachers
and
new
ways
to
measure
how
well
our
kids
think
not
how
well
they
can
fill
in
bubble
on
test
but
it
worth
it
and
it
working
the
problem
is
we
still
not
reaching
enough
kids
and
we
not
reaching
them
in
time
that
has
to
change
research
shows
that
one
of
the
best
investments
we
can
make
in
child
life
is
early
education
last
year
asked
this
congress
to
help
states
make
available
to
every
four
as
parent
as
well
as
president
repeat
that
request
tonight
but
in
the
meantime
thirty
states
have
raised
funding
on
their
own
they
know
we
wait
so
just
as
we
worked
with
states
to
reform
our
schools
this
year
we
invest
in
new
partnerships
with
states
and
communities
across
the
country
in
race
to
the
top
for
our
youngest
children
and
as
congress
decides
what
it
going
to
do
going
to
pull
together
coalition
of
elected
officials
business
leaders
and
philanthropists
willing
to
help
more
kids
access
the
they
need
last
year
also
pledged
to
connect
percent
of
our
students
to
broadband
over
the
next
four
years
tonight
can
announce
that
with
the
support
of
the
and
companies
like
apple
sprint
and
we
got
down
payment
to
start
connecting
more
than
schools
and
twenty
million
students
over
the
next
two
years
without
adding
dime
to
the
deficit
we
working
to
redesign
high
schools
and
partner
them
with
colleges
and
employers
that
offer
the
education
and
training
that
can
lead
directly
to
job
and
career
we
shaking
up
our
system
of
higher
education
to
give
parents
more
information
and
colleges
more
incentives
to
offer
better
value
so
that
no
kid
is
priced
out
of
college
education
we
offering
millions
the
opportunity
to
cap
their
monthly
student
loan
payments
to
ten
percent
of
their
income
and
want
to
work
with
congress
to
see
how
we
can
help
even
more
americans
who
feel
trapped
by
student
loan
debt
and
reaching
out
to
some
of
america
leading
foundations
and
corporations
on
new
initiative
to
help
more
young
men
of
facing
tough
odds
stay
on
track
and
reach
their
full
potential
the
bottom
line
is
and
want
every
child
to
have
the
same
chance
this
country
gave
us
but
we
know
our
opportunity
agenda
be
complete
and
too
many
young
people
entering
the
workforce
today
will
see
the
american
dream
as
an
empty
promise
unless
we
do
more
to
make
sure
our
economy
honors
the
dignity
of
work
and
hard
work
pays
off
for
every
single
american
today
women
make
up
about
half
our
workforce
but
they
still
make
cents
for
every
dollar
man
earns
that
is
wrong
and
in
it
an
embarrassment
woman
deserves
equal
pay
for
equal
work
she
deserves
to
have
baby
without
sacrificing
her
job
mother
deserves
day
off
to
care
for
sick
child
or
sick
parent
without
running
into
hardship
and
you
know
what
father
does
too
it
time
to
do
away
with
workplace
policies
that
belong
in
mad
men
episode
this
year
let
all
come
together
congress
the
white
house
and
businesses
from
wall
street
to
main
street
to
give
every
woman
the
opportunity
she
deserves
because
firmly
believe
when
women
succeed
america
succeeds
now
women
hold
majority
of
jobs
but
they
not
the
only
ones
stifled
by
stagnant
wages
americans
understand
that
some
people
will
earn
more
than
others
and
we
do
resent
those
who
by
virtue
of
their
efforts
achieve
incredible
success
but
americans
overwhelmingly
agree
that
no
one
who
works
full
time
should
ever
have
to
raise
family
in
poverty
in
the
year
since
asked
this
congress
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
five
states
have
passed
laws
to
raise
theirs
many
businesses
have
done
it
on
their
own
nick
chute
is
here
tonight
with
his
boss
john
john
an
owner
of
punch
pizza
in
and
nick
helps
make
the
dough
only
now
he
makes
more
of
it
john
just
gave
his
employees
raise
to
ten
bucks
an
hour
decision
that
eased
their
financial
stress
and
boosted
their
morale
tonight
ask
more
of
america
business
leaders
to
follow
john
lead
and
do
what
you
can
to
raise
your
employees
wages
to
every
mayor
governor
and
state
legislator
in
america
say
you
do
have
to
wait
for
congress
to
act
americans
will
support
you
if
you
take
this
on
and
as
chief
executive
intend
to
lead
by
example
profitable
corporations
like
see
higher
wages
as
the
smart
way
to
boost
productivity
and
reduce
turnover
we
should
too
in
the
coming
weeks
will
issue
an
executive
order
requiring
federal
contractors
to
pay
their
employees
fair
wage
of
at
least
an
hour
because
if
you
cook
our
troops
meals
or
wash
their
dishes
you
should
have
to
live
in
poverty
of
course
to
reach
millions
more
congress
needs
to
get
on
board
today
the
federal
minimum
wage
is
worth
about
twenty
percent
less
than
it
was
when
first
stood
here
and
george
miller
have
bill
to
fix
that
by
lifting
the
minimum
wage
to
this
will
help
families
it
will
give
businesses
customers
with
more
money
to
spend
it
does
involve
any
new
bureaucratic
program
so
join
the
rest
of
the
country
say
yes
give
america
raise
there
are
other
steps
we
can
take
to
help
families
make
ends
meet
and
few
are
more
effective
at
reducing
inequality
and
helping
families
pull
themselves
up
through
hard
work
than
the
earned
income
tax
credit
right
now
it
helps
about
half
of
all
parents
at
some
point
but
agree
with
republicans
like
senator
that
it
does
do
enough
for
single
workers
who
do
have
kids
so
let
work
together
to
strengthen
the
credit
reward
work
and
help
more
americans
get
ahead
let
do
more
to
help
americans
save
for
retirement
today
most
workers
do
have
pension
social
security
check
often
is
enough
on
its
own
and
while
the
stock
market
has
doubled
over
the
last
five
years
that
does
help
folks
who
do
have
that
why
tomorrow
will
direct
the
treasury
to
create
new
way
for
working
americans
to
start
their
own
retirement
savings
it
new
savings
bond
that
encourages
folks
to
build
nest
egg
guarantees
decent
return
with
no
risk
of
losing
what
you
put
in
and
if
this
congress
wants
to
help
work
with
me
to
fix
an
tax
code
that
gives
big
tax
breaks
to
help
the
wealthy
save
but
does
little
to
nothing
for
americans
offer
every
american
access
to
an
automatic
on
the
job
so
they
can
save
at
work
just
like
everyone
in
this
chamber
can
and
since
the
most
important
investment
many
families
make
is
their
home
send
me
legislation
that
protects
taxpayers
from
footing
the
bill
for
housing
crisis
ever
again
and
keeps
the
dream
of
alive
for
future
generations
of
americans
one
last
point
on
financial
security
for
decades
few
things
exposed
families
to
economic
hardship
more
than
broken
health
care
system
and
in
case
you
have
heard
we
in
the
process
of
fixing
that
condition
used
to
mean
that
someone
like
physician
assistant
and
single
mom
from
arizona
could
get
health
insurance
but
on
january
she
got
covered
on
january
she
felt
sharp
pain
on
january
she
had
emergency
surgery
just
one
week
earlier
said
that
surgery
would
meant
bankruptcy
that
what
health
insurance
reform
is
all
about
the
peace
of
mind
that
if
misfortune
strikes
you
do
have
to
lose
everything
already
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
more
than
three
million
americans
under
age
have
gained
coverage
under
their
parents
plans
more
than
nine
million
americans
have
signed
up
for
private
health
insurance
or
coverage
and
here
another
number
zero
because
of
this
law
no
american
can
ever
again
be
dropped
or
denied
coverage
for
condition
like
asthma
back
pain
or
cancer
no
woman
can
ever
be
charged
more
just
because
she
woman
and
we
did
all
this
while
adding
years
to
finances
keeping
premiums
flat
and
lowering
prescription
costs
for
millions
of
seniors
now
do
expect
to
convince
my
republican
friends
on
the
merits
of
this
law
but
know
that
the
american
people
are
interested
in
old
battles
so
again
if
you
have
specific
plans
to
cut
costs
cover
more
people
and
increase
choice
tell
america
what
you
do
differently
let
see
if
the
numbers
add
up
but
let
not
have
another
votes
to
repeal
law
that
already
helping
millions
of
americans
like
the
first
forty
were
plenty
we
got
it
we
all
owe
it
to
the
american
people
to
say
what
we
for
not
just
what
we
against
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
real
impact
this
law
is
having
just
talk
to
governor
of
kentucky
who
here
tonight
kentucky
not
the
most
liberal
part
of
the
country
but
he
like
man
possessed
when
it
comes
to
covering
his
commonwealth
families
they
are
our
friends
and
he
said
they
are
people
we
shop
and
go
to
church
out
on
the
are
people
who
go
to
work
every
morning
praying
they
do
get
sick
no
one
deserves
to
live
that
way
right
that
why
tonight
ask
every
american
who
knows
someone
without
health
insurance
to
help
them
get
covered
by
march
moms
get
on
your
kids
to
sign
up
kids
call
your
mom
and
walk
her
through
the
application
it
will
give
her
some
peace
of
mind
plus
she
appreciate
hearing
from
you
after
all
that
the
spirit
that
has
always
moved
this
nation
forward
it
the
spirit
of
citizenship
the
recognition
that
through
hard
work
and
responsibility
we
can
pursue
our
individual
dreams
but
still
come
together
as
one
american
family
to
make
sure
the
next
generation
can
pursue
its
dreams
as
well
citizenship
means
standing
up
for
everyone
right
to
vote
last
year
part
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
weakened
but
conservative
republicans
and
liberal
democrats
are
working
together
to
strengthen
it
and
the
bipartisan
commission
appointed
last
year
has
offered
reforms
so
that
no
one
has
to
wait
more
than
half
hour
to
vote
let
support
these
efforts
it
should
be
the
power
of
our
vote
not
the
size
of
our
bank
account
that
drives
our
democracy
citizenship
means
standing
up
for
the
lives
that
gun
violence
steals
from
us
each
day
have
seen
the
courage
of
parents
students
pastors
and
police
officers
all
over
this
country
who
say
we
are
not
afraid
and
intend
to
keep
trying
with
or
without
congress
to
help
stop
more
tragedies
from
visiting
innocent
americans
in
our
movie
shopping
malls
or
schools
like
sandy
hook
citizenship
demands
sense
of
common
cause
participation
in
the
hard
work
of
an
obligation
to
serve
to
our
communities
and
know
this
chamber
agrees
that
few
americans
give
more
to
their
country
than
our
diplomats
and
the
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
tonight
because
of
the
extraordinary
troops
and
civilians
who
risk
and
lay
down
their
lives
to
keep
us
free
the
united
states
is
more
secure
when
took
office
nearly
americans
were
serving
in
iraq
and
today
all
our
troops
are
out
of
iraq
more
than
of
our
troops
have
already
come
home
from
with
afghan
forces
now
in
the
lead
for
their
own
security
our
troops
have
moved
to
support
role
together
with
our
allies
we
will
complete
our
mission
there
by
the
end
of
this
year
and
america
longest
war
will
finally
be
over
after
we
will
support
unified
as
it
takes
responsibility
for
its
own
future
if
the
afghan
government
signs
security
agreement
that
we
have
negotiated
small
force
of
americans
could
remain
in
with
nato
allies
to
carry
out
two
narrow
missions
training
and
assisting
afghan
forces
and
operations
to
pursue
any
remnants
of
for
while
our
relationship
with
will
change
one
thing
will
not
our
resolve
that
terrorists
do
not
launch
attacks
against
our
country
the
fact
is
that
danger
remains
while
we
have
put
core
leadership
on
path
to
defeat
the
threat
has
evolved
as
affiliates
and
other
extremists
take
root
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
yemen
somalia
iraq
and
we
have
to
keep
working
with
partners
to
disrupt
and
disable
these
networks
in
syria
we
support
the
opposition
that
rejects
the
agenda
of
terrorist
networks
here
at
home
we
keep
strengthening
our
defenses
and
combat
new
threats
like
and
as
we
reform
our
budget
we
have
to
keep
faith
with
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
invest
in
the
capabilities
they
need
to
succeed
in
future
missions
we
have
to
remain
vigilant
but
strongly
believe
our
leadership
and
our
security
can
not
depend
on
our
military
alone
as
have
used
force
when
needed
to
protect
the
american
people
and
will
never
hesitate
to
do
so
as
long
as
hold
this
office
but
will
not
send
our
troops
into
harm
way
unless
it
truly
necessary
nor
will
allow
our
sons
and
daughters
to
be
mired
in
conflicts
we
must
fight
the
battles
that
need
to
be
fought
not
those
that
terrorists
prefer
from
us
deployments
that
drain
our
strength
and
may
ultimately
feed
extremism
so
even
as
we
aggressively
pursue
terrorist
networks
through
more
targeted
efforts
and
by
building
the
capacity
of
our
foreign
partners
america
must
move
off
permanent
war
footing
that
why
imposed
prudent
limits
on
the
use
of
drones
for
we
will
not
be
safer
if
people
abroad
believe
we
strike
within
their
countries
without
regard
for
the
consequence
that
why
working
with
this
congress
will
reform
our
surveillance
programs
because
the
vital
work
of
our
intelligence
community
depends
on
public
confidence
here
and
abroad
that
the
privacy
of
ordinary
people
is
not
being
violated
and
with
the
afghan
war
ending
this
needs
to
be
the
year
congress
lifts
the
remaining
restrictions
on
detainee
transfers
and
we
close
the
prison
at
bay
because
we
counter
terrorism
not
just
through
intelligence
and
military
action
but
by
remaining
true
to
our
constitutional
ideals
and
setting
an
example
for
the
rest
of
the
world
you
see
in
world
of
complex
threats
our
security
and
leadership
depends
on
all
elements
of
our
power
including
strong
and
principled
diplomacy
american
diplomacy
has
rallied
more
than
fifty
countries
to
prevent
nuclear
materials
from
falling
into
the
wrong
hands
and
allowed
us
to
reduce
our
own
reliance
on
cold
war
stockpiles
american
diplomacy
backed
by
the
threat
of
force
is
why
syria
chemical
weapons
are
being
eliminated
and
we
will
continue
to
work
with
the
international
community
to
usher
in
the
future
the
syrian
people
deserve
future
free
of
dictatorship
terror
and
fear
as
we
speak
american
diplomacy
is
supporting
israelis
and
as
they
engage
in
difficult
but
necessary
talks
to
end
the
conflict
there
to
achieve
dignity
and
an
independent
state
for
and
lasting
peace
and
security
for
the
state
of
israel
jewish
state
that
knows
america
will
always
be
at
their
side
and
it
is
american
diplomacy
backed
by
pressure
that
has
halted
the
progress
of
iran
nuclear
program
and
rolled
parts
of
that
program
back
for
the
very
first
time
in
decade
as
we
gather
here
tonight
iran
has
begun
to
eliminate
its
stockpile
of
higher
levels
of
enriched
uranium
it
is
not
installing
advanced
centrifuges
unprecedented
inspections
help
the
world
verify
every
day
that
iran
is
not
building
bomb
and
with
our
allies
and
partners
we
engaged
in
negotiations
to
see
if
we
can
peacefully
achieve
goal
we
all
share
preventing
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
these
negotiations
will
be
difficult
they
may
not
succeed
we
are
about
iran
support
for
terrorist
like
which
threaten
our
allies
and
the
mistrust
between
our
nations
can
not
be
wished
away
but
these
negotiations
do
not
rely
on
trust
any
deal
we
agree
to
must
be
based
on
verifiable
action
that
convinces
us
and
the
international
community
that
iran
is
not
building
nuclear
bomb
if
john
kennedy
and
could
negotiate
with
the
soviet
union
then
surely
strong
and
confident
america
can
negotiate
with
less
powerful
adversaries
today
the
sanctions
that
we
put
in
place
helped
make
this
opportunity
possible
but
let
me
be
clear
if
this
congress
sends
me
new
sanctions
bill
now
that
threatens
to
derail
these
talks
will
veto
it
for
the
sake
of
our
national
security
we
must
give
diplomacy
chance
to
succeed
if
iran
leaders
do
not
seize
this
opportunity
then
will
be
the
first
to
call
for
more
sanctions
and
stand
ready
to
exercise
all
options
to
make
sure
iran
does
not
build
nuclear
weapon
but
if
iran
leaders
do
seize
the
chance
then
iran
could
take
an
important
step
to
rejoin
the
community
of
nations
and
we
will
have
resolved
one
of
the
leading
security
challenges
of
our
time
without
the
risks
of
war
finally
let
remember
that
our
leadership
is
defined
not
just
by
our
against
threats
but
by
the
enormous
opportunities
to
do
good
and
promote
understanding
around
the
globe
to
forge
greater
cooperation
to
expand
new
markets
to
free
people
from
fear
and
want
and
no
one
is
better
positioned
to
take
advantage
of
those
opportunities
than
america
our
alliance
with
europe
remains
the
strongest
the
world
has
ever
known
from
tunisia
to
burma
we
supporting
those
who
are
willing
to
do
the
hard
work
of
building
democracy
in
ukraine
we
stand
for
the
principle
that
all
people
have
the
right
to
express
themselves
freely
and
peacefully
and
have
say
in
their
country
future
across
africa
we
bringing
together
businesses
and
governments
to
double
access
to
electricity
and
help
end
extreme
poverty
in
the
we
are
building
new
ties
of
commerce
but
we
also
expanding
cultural
and
educational
exchanges
among
young
people
and
we
will
continue
to
focus
on
the
where
we
support
our
allies
shape
future
of
greater
security
and
prosperity
and
extend
hand
to
those
devastated
by
disaster
as
we
did
in
the
when
our
marines
and
civilians
rushed
to
aid
those
battered
by
typhoon
and
were
greeted
with
words
like
we
will
never
forget
your
kindness
and
god
bless
america
we
do
these
things
because
they
help
promote
our
security
and
we
do
them
because
we
believe
in
the
inherent
dignity
and
equality
of
every
human
being
regardless
of
race
or
religion
creed
or
sexual
orientation
and
next
week
the
world
will
see
one
expression
of
that
commitment
when
team
marches
the
red
white
and
blue
into
the
olympic
stadium
and
brings
home
the
gold
my
fellow
americans
no
other
country
in
the
world
does
what
we
do
on
every
issue
the
world
turns
to
us
not
simply
because
of
the
size
of
our
economy
or
our
military
might
but
because
of
the
ideals
we
stand
for
and
the
burdens
we
bear
to
advance
them
no
one
knows
this
better
than
those
who
serve
in
uniform
as
this
time
of
war
draws
to
close
new
generation
of
returns
to
civilian
life
we
keep
slashing
that
backlog
so
our
veterans
receive
the
benefits
they
earned
and
our
wounded
warriors
receive
the
health
care
including
the
mental
health
care
that
they
need
we
keep
working
to
help
all
our
veterans
translate
their
skills
and
leadership
into
jobs
here
at
home
and
we
all
continue
to
join
forces
to
and
support
our
remarkable
military
families
let
me
tell
you
about
one
of
those
families
come
to
know
first
met
proud
army
ranger
at
beach
on
the
anniversary
of
along
with
some
of
his
fellow
rangers
he
walked
me
through
the
program
strong
impressive
young
man
with
an
easy
manner
sharp
as
tack
we
joked
around
and
took
pictures
and
told
him
to
stay
in
touch
few
months
later
on
his
tenth
deployment
was
nearly
killed
by
massive
roadside
bomb
in
his
comrades
found
him
in
canal
face
down
underwater
shrapnel
in
his
brain
for
months
he
lay
in
coma
the
next
time
met
him
in
the
hospital
he
could
speak
he
could
barely
move
over
the
years
he
endured
dozens
of
surgeries
and
procedures
and
hours
of
grueling
every
day
even
now
is
still
blind
in
one
eye
he
still
struggles
on
his
left
side
but
slowly
steadily
with
the
support
of
like
his
dad
and
the
community
around
him
has
grown
stronger
day
by
day
he
learned
to
speak
again
and
stand
again
and
walk
again
and
he
working
toward
the
day
when
he
can
serve
his
country
again
my
recovery
has
not
been
easy
he
says
nothing
in
life
that
worth
anything
is
easy
is
here
tonight
and
like
the
army
he
loves
like
the
america
he
serves
sergeant
first
class
never
gives
up
and
he
does
not
quit
my
fellow
americans
men
and
women
like
remind
us
that
america
has
never
come
easy
our
freedom
our
democracy
has
never
been
easy
sometimes
we
stumble
we
make
mistakes
we
get
frustrated
or
discouraged
but
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
we
have
put
those
things
aside
and
placed
our
collective
shoulder
to
the
wheel
of
progress
to
create
and
build
and
expand
the
possibilities
of
individual
achievement
to
free
other
nations
from
tyranny
and
fear
to
promote
justice
and
fairness
and
equality
under
the
law
so
that
the
words
set
to
paper
by
our
founders
are
made
real
for
every
citizen
the
america
we
want
for
our
kids
rising
america
where
honest
work
is
plentiful
and
communities
are
strong
where
prosperity
is
widely
shared
and
opportunity
for
all
lets
us
go
as
far
as
our
dreams
and
toil
will
take
us
none
of
it
is
easy
but
if
we
work
together
if
we
summon
what
is
best
in
us
with
our
feet
planted
firmly
in
today
but
our
eyes
cast
towards
tomorrow
know
it
within
our
reach
believe
it
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
what
singular
it
is
for
me
to
be
here
today
want
to
thank
first
and
foremost
the
family
for
giving
us
this
opportunity
and
the
graciousness
with
which
and
have
been
received
we
came
down
little
bit
late
because
we
were
upstairs
looking
at
some
of
the
exhibits
and
some
of
the
private
offices
that
were
used
by
president
and
and
was
in
particular
interested
to
of
recording
in
which
lady
bird
is
president
performance
and
she
said
come
come
you
need
to
listen
to
this
and
she
pressed
the
button
and
nodded
her
head
some
things
do
not
change
even
years
later
to
all
the
members
of
congress
the
warriors
for
justice
the
elected
officials
and
community
leaders
who
are
here
today
want
to
thank
you
four
days
into
his
sudden
presidency
and
the
night
before
he
would
address
joint
session
of
the
congress
in
which
he
once
served
sat
around
table
with
his
closest
preparing
his
remarks
to
shattered
and
grieving
nation
he
wanted
to
call
on
senators
and
representatives
to
pass
civil
rights
bill
the
most
sweeping
since
reconstruction
and
most
of
his
staff
him
against
it
they
said
it
was
hopeless
that
it
would
anger
powerful
southern
democrats
and
committee
chairmen
that
it
risked
derailing
the
rest
of
his
domestic
agenda
and
one
particularly
bold
aide
said
he
did
not
believe
president
should
spend
his
time
and
power
on
lost
causes
however
worthy
they
might
be
to
which
it
is
said
president
replied
what
the
the
presidency
for
what
the
the
presidency
for
if
not
to
fight
for
causes
you
believe
in
today
as
we
commemorate
the
anniversary
of
the
civil
rights
act
we
the
men
and
women
who
made
it
possible
some
of
them
are
here
today
we
celebrate
giants
like
john
and
andrew
young
and
bond
we
recall
the
countless
unheralded
americans
black
and
white
students
and
scholars
preachers
and
housekeepers
whose
names
are
etched
not
on
monuments
but
in
the
hearts
of
their
loved
ones
and
in
the
fabric
of
the
country
they
helped
to
change
but
we
also
gather
here
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
state
that
shaped
him
to
recall
one
giant
remarkable
efforts
to
make
real
the
promise
of
our
founding
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
those
of
us
who
have
had
the
singular
privilege
to
hold
the
office
of
the
presidency
know
well
that
progress
in
this
country
can
be
hard
and
it
can
be
slow
frustrating
and
sometimes
stymied
the
office
humbles
you
reminded
daily
that
in
this
great
democracy
you
are
but
relay
swimmer
in
the
currents
of
history
bound
by
decisions
made
by
those
who
came
before
reliant
on
the
efforts
of
those
who
will
follow
to
fully
vindicate
your
vision
but
the
presidency
also
affords
unique
opportunity
to
bend
those
currents
by
shaping
our
laws
and
by
shaping
our
debates
by
working
within
the
confines
of
the
world
as
it
is
but
also
by
the
world
as
it
should
be
this
was
president
genius
as
master
of
politics
and
the
legislative
process
he
grasped
like
few
others
the
power
of
government
to
bring
about
change
was
nothing
if
not
realist
he
was
well
aware
that
the
law
alone
enough
to
change
hearts
and
minds
full
century
after
time
he
said
until
justice
is
blind
to
until
education
is
unaware
of
race
until
opportunity
is
unconcerned
with
the
of
skins
emancipation
will
be
proclamation
but
not
he
understood
laws
accomplish
everything
but
he
also
knew
that
only
the
law
could
anchor
change
and
set
hearts
and
minds
on
different
course
and
lot
of
americans
needed
the
most
basic
protections
at
that
time
as
king
said
at
the
time
it
may
be
true
that
the
law
make
man
love
me
but
it
can
keep
him
from
lynching
me
and
think
pretty
and
passing
laws
was
what
knew
how
to
do
no
one
knew
politics
and
no
one
loved
legislating
more
than
president
he
was
charming
when
he
needed
to
be
ruthless
when
required
he
could
wear
you
down
with
logic
and
argument
he
could
horse
trade
and
he
could
flatter
you
come
with
me
on
this
bill
he
would
reportedly
tell
key
republican
leader
from
my
home
state
during
the
fight
for
the
civil
rights
bill
years
from
now
schoolchildren
will
know
only
two
names
abraham
lincoln
and
and
he
knew
that
senators
would
believe
things
like
that
president
liked
power
he
liked
the
feel
of
it
the
wielding
of
it
but
that
hunger
was
harnessed
and
redeemed
by
deeper
understanding
of
the
human
condition
by
sympathy
for
the
underdog
for
the
downtrodden
for
the
outcast
and
it
was
sympathy
rooted
in
his
own
experience
as
young
boy
growing
up
in
the
texas
hill
country
knew
what
being
poor
felt
like
was
so
common
he
would
later
say
even
know
it
had
the
family
home
have
electricity
or
indoor
plumbing
everybody
worked
hard
including
the
children
president
had
known
the
metallic
taste
of
hunger
the
feel
of
calloused
hands
rubbed
raw
from
washing
and
cleaning
and
holding
household
together
his
cousin
remembered
sweltering
days
spent
on
her
hands
and
knees
in
the
cotton
fields
with
whispering
beside
her
got
to
be
better
way
to
make
living
than
this
got
to
be
better
it
until
years
later
when
he
was
teaching
at
mexican
school
in
tiny
town
in
texas
that
he
came
to
understand
how
much
worse
the
persistent
pain
of
poverty
could
be
for
other
races
in
crow
south
his
students
would
show
up
to
class
hungry
and
when
visit
their
homes
meet
fathers
who
were
paid
slave
wages
by
the
farmers
they
worked
for
those
children
were
taught
he
would
later
say
the
end
of
life
is
in
beet
row
spinach
field
or
cotton
deprivation
and
discrimination
these
were
not
abstractions
to
he
knew
that
poverty
and
injustice
are
as
inseparable
as
opportunity
and
justice
are
joined
so
that
was
in
him
from
an
early
age
now
like
any
of
us
he
was
not
perfect
man
his
experiences
in
rural
texas
may
have
stretched
his
moral
imagination
but
he
was
ambitious
very
ambitious
young
man
in
hurry
to
plot
his
own
escape
from
poverty
and
to
chart
his
own
political
career
and
in
the
crow
south
that
meant
not
challenging
convention
during
his
first
years
in
congress
he
opposed
every
civil
rights
bill
that
came
up
for
vote
once
calling
the
push
for
federal
legislation
farce
and
he
was
chosen
as
vice
presidential
nominee
in
part
because
of
his
affinity
with
and
ability
to
deliver
that
southern
white
vote
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
kennedy
administration
he
shared
with
president
kennedy
caution
towards
racial
controversy
but
marchers
kept
marching
four
little
girls
were
killed
in
church
bloody
sunday
happened
the
winds
of
change
blew
and
when
the
time
came
when
stood
in
the
oval
office
picture
him
standing
there
taking
up
the
entire
looking
out
over
the
south
lawn
in
quiet
moment
and
asked
himself
what
the
true
purpose
of
his
office
was
for
what
was
the
of
his
ambitions
he
would
reach
back
in
his
own
memory
and
remember
his
own
experience
with
want
and
he
knew
that
he
had
unique
capacity
as
the
most
powerful
white
politician
from
the
south
to
not
merely
challenge
the
convention
that
had
crushed
the
dreams
of
so
many
but
to
ultimately
dismantle
for
good
the
structures
of
legal
segregation
the
only
guy
who
could
do
it
and
he
knew
there
would
be
cost
famously
saying
the
democratic
party
may
lost
the
south
for
what
his
presidency
was
for
where
he
meets
his
moment
and
possessed
with
an
iron
will
possessed
with
those
skills
that
he
had
honed
so
many
years
in
congress
pushed
and
supported
by
movement
of
those
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
for
their
own
liberation
president
fought
for
and
argued
and
horse
traded
and
bullied
and
persuaded
until
ultimately
he
signed
the
civil
rights
act
into
law
and
he
stop
there
even
though
his
again
told
him
to
wait
again
told
him
let
the
dust
settle
let
the
country
absorb
this
momentous
decision
he
shook
them
off
meat
in
the
coconut
as
president
would
put
it
was
the
voting
rights
act
so
he
fought
for
and
passed
that
as
well
immigration
reform
came
shortly
after
and
then
fair
housing
act
and
then
health
care
law
that
opponents
described
as
that
would
curtail
freedom
but
ultimately
freed
millions
of
seniors
from
the
fear
that
illness
could
rob
them
of
dignity
and
security
in
their
golden
years
which
we
now
know
today
as
what
president
understood
was
that
equality
required
more
than
the
absence
of
oppression
it
required
the
presence
of
economic
opportunity
he
be
as
eloquent
as
king
would
be
in
describing
that
linkage
as
king
moved
into
sanitation
workers
and
poor
movement
but
he
understood
that
connection
because
he
had
lived
it
decent
job
decent
wages
health
care
those
too
were
civil
rights
worth
fighting
for
an
economy
where
hard
work
is
rewarded
and
success
is
shared
that
was
his
goal
and
he
knew
as
someone
who
had
seen
the
new
deal
transform
the
landscape
of
his
texas
childhood
who
had
seen
the
difference
electricity
had
made
because
of
the
valley
authority
the
transformation
concretely
day
in
and
day
out
in
the
life
of
his
own
family
he
understood
that
government
had
role
to
play
in
broadening
prosperity
to
all
those
who
would
strive
for
it
want
to
open
the
gates
to
opportunity
president
said
we
are
also
going
to
give
all
our
people
black
and
white
the
help
they
need
to
walk
through
those
now
if
some
of
this
sounds
familiar
because
today
we
remain
locked
in
this
same
great
debate
about
equality
and
opportunity
and
the
role
of
government
in
ensuring
each
as
was
true
years
ago
there
are
those
who
dismiss
the
great
society
as
failed
experiment
and
an
encroachment
on
liberty
who
argue
that
government
has
become
the
true
source
of
all
that
ails
us
and
that
poverty
is
due
to
the
moral
failings
of
those
who
suffer
from
it
there
are
also
those
who
argue
john
that
nothing
has
changed
that
racism
is
so
embedded
in
our
that
there
is
no
use
trying
politics
the
game
is
rigged
but
such
theories
ignore
history
yes
true
that
despite
laws
like
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
voting
rights
act
and
our
society
is
still
racked
with
division
and
poverty
yes
race
still
our
political
debates
and
there
have
been
government
programs
that
have
fallen
short
in
time
when
cynicism
is
too
often
passed
off
as
wisdom
perhaps
easy
to
conclude
that
there
are
limits
to
change
that
we
are
trapped
by
our
own
history
and
politics
is
errand
and
be
better
off
if
we
roll
back
big
chunks
of
legacy
or
at
least
if
we
put
too
much
of
our
hope
invest
too
much
of
our
hope
in
our
government
reject
such
thinking
not
just
because
and
have
lifted
millions
from
suffering
not
just
because
the
poverty
rate
in
this
nation
would
be
far
worse
without
food
stamps
and
head
start
and
all
the
great
society
programs
that
survive
to
this
day
reject
such
cynicism
because
have
lived
out
the
promise
of
efforts
because
has
lived
out
the
legacy
of
those
efforts
because
my
daughters
have
lived
out
the
legacy
of
those
efforts
because
and
millions
of
my
generation
were
in
position
to
take
the
baton
that
he
handed
to
us
because
of
the
civil
rights
movement
because
of
the
laws
president
signed
new
doors
of
opportunity
and
education
swung
open
for
everybody
not
all
at
once
but
they
swung
open
not
just
blacks
and
whites
but
also
women
and
and
asians
and
native
americans
and
gay
americans
and
americans
with
disability
they
swung
open
for
you
and
they
swung
open
for
me
and
why
standing
here
today
because
of
those
efforts
because
of
that
legacy
and
that
means
got
debt
to
pay
that
means
we
afford
to
be
cynical
half
century
later
the
laws
passed
are
now
as
fundamental
to
our
conception
of
ourselves
and
our
democracy
as
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
they
are
foundational
an
essential
piece
of
the
american
character
but
we
are
here
today
because
we
know
we
can
not
be
complacent
for
history
travels
not
only
forwards
history
can
travel
backwards
history
can
travel
sideways
and
securing
the
gains
this
country
has
made
requires
the
vigilance
of
its
citizens
our
rights
our
freedoms
they
are
not
given
they
must
be
won
they
must
be
nurtured
through
struggle
and
discipline
and
persistence
and
faith
and
one
concern
have
sometimes
during
these
moments
the
celebration
of
the
signing
of
the
civil
rights
act
the
march
on
washington
from
distance
sometimes
these
commemorations
seem
inevitable
they
seem
easy
all
the
pain
and
difficulty
and
struggle
and
doubt
all
that
is
rubbed
away
and
we
look
at
ourselves
and
we
say
oh
things
are
just
too
different
now
we
possibly
do
what
was
done
then
these
giants
what
they
accomplished
and
yet
they
were
men
and
women
too
it
easy
then
it
certain
then
still
the
story
of
america
is
story
of
progress
however
slow
however
incomplete
however
harshly
challenged
at
each
point
on
our
journey
however
flawed
our
leaders
however
many
times
we
have
to
take
quarter
of
loaf
or
half
loaf
the
story
of
america
is
story
of
progress
and
true
because
of
men
like
president
in
so
many
ways
he
embodied
america
with
all
our
gifts
and
all
our
flaws
in
all
our
restlessness
and
all
our
big
dreams
this
man
born
into
poverty
weaned
in
world
full
of
racial
hatred
somehow
found
within
himself
the
ability
to
connect
his
experience
with
the
brown
child
in
small
texas
town
the
white
child
in
the
black
child
in
watts
as
powerful
as
he
became
in
that
oval
office
he
understood
them
he
understood
what
it
meant
to
be
on
the
outside
and
he
believed
that
their
plight
was
his
plight
too
that
his
freedom
ultimately
was
wrapped
up
in
theirs
and
that
making
their
lives
better
was
what
the
hell
the
presidency
was
for
and
those
children
were
on
his
mind
when
he
strode
to
the
podium
that
night
in
the
house
chamber
when
he
called
for
the
vote
on
the
civil
rights
law
never
occurred
to
me
he
said
my
fondest
dreams
that
might
have
the
chance
to
help
the
sons
and
daughters
of
those
that
he
had
taught
so
many
years
ago
to
help
people
like
them
all
over
this
country
but
now
do
have
that
chance
and
let
you
in
on
secret
mean
to
use
it
and
hope
that
you
will
use
it
with
that
was
greatness
why
we
remember
him
and
if
there
is
one
thing
that
he
and
this
anniversary
should
teach
us
if
one
lesson
hope
that
and
and
young
people
everywhere
learn
from
this
day
that
with
enough
effort
and
enough
empathy
and
enough
perseverance
and
enough
courage
people
who
love
their
country
can
change
it
in
his
final
year
president
stood
on
this
stage
racked
with
pain
battered
by
the
controversies
of
looking
far
older
than
his
years
and
he
delivered
what
would
be
his
final
public
have
proved
that
great
progress
is
possible
he
said
know
how
much
still
remains
to
be
done
and
if
our
efforts
continue
and
if
our
will
is
strong
and
if
our
hearts
are
right
and
if
courage
remains
our
constant
companion
then
my
fellow
americans
am
confident
we
shall
we
shall
overcome
we
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
like
king
like
abraham
lincoln
like
countless
citizens
who
have
driven
this
country
inexorably
forward
president
knew
that
ours
in
the
end
is
story
of
optimism
story
of
achievement
and
constant
striving
that
is
unique
upon
this
earth
he
knew
because
he
had
lived
that
story
he
believed
that
together
we
can
build
an
america
that
is
more
fair
more
equal
and
more
free
than
the
one
we
inherited
he
believed
we
make
our
own
destiny
and
in
part
because
of
him
we
must
believe
it
as
well
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
president
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
his
official
delegation
members
of
the
cabinet
present
members
of
the
press
ladies
and
gentlemen
good
afternoon
today
the
welcomes
president
and
his
delegation
on
his
first
state
visit
to
the
the
united
states
is
key
ally
strategic
partner
and
reliable
friend
of
the
with
this
visit
we
reaffirm
the
deep
partnership
between
our
countries
one
founded
on
democratic
values
mutual
interest
in
our
shared
history
and
aspirations
and
one
that
will
definitely
give
us
the
momentum
to
propel
our
peoples
to
even
greater
heights
we
witnessed
the
most
recent
and
tangible
manifestations
of
this
in
the
immediate
outpouring
of
assistance
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
american
people
in
the
aftermath
of
typhoon
or
and
your
clear
expression
of
solidarity
with
the
typhoon
survivors
president
in
your
state
of
the
union
address
earlier
this
year
you
spoke
of
how

to
our

reflects
an
important
concept
the
idea
that
we
have
to
work
together
to
accomplish
things
that
we
achieve
on
our
own
what
we
saw
last
year
when
typhoon
devastated
so
many
communities
our
armed
forces
and
civilians
from
both
our
countries
worked
as
one
to
rescue
victims
and
to
deliver
lifesaving
aid
what
friends

for
each
other
and
president

new
chapter
in
the
relationship
between
our
countries
and
it
starts
with
our
security
with
the
new
cooperation
agreement
that
was
signed
today
want
to
be
very
clear
the
united
states
is
not
trying
to
reclaim
old
bases
or
build
new
bases
at
the
invitation
of
the
american
will
rotate
through
facilities
train
and
exercise
more
together
so
that
prepared
for
range
of
challenges
including
humanitarian
crises
and
natural
disasters
like
work
together
to
build
the
capabilities
and
to
work
with
other
nations
to
promote
regional
stability
such
as
in
the
south
china
sea
and
looking
forward
to
my
visit
with
forces
from
both
our
nations
tomorrow
to
their
service
and
to
look
ahead
to
the
future
we
can
shape
together
as
we
strengthen
our
bilateral
security
cooperation
also
working
together
with
regional
institutions
like
and
the
east
asia
summit
when
we
met
in
the
oval
office
two
years
ago
and
agreed
to
promote
common
set
of
rules
founded
in
respect
for
international
law
that
will
help
the
asia
pacific
remain
open
and
inclusive
as
the
region
grows
and
develops
today
we
have
reaffirmed
the
importance
of
resolving
territorial
disputes
in
the
region
peacefully
without
intimidation
or
coercion
and
in
that
spirit
told
him
that
the
united
states
supports
his
decision
to
pursue
international
arbitration
concerning
territorial
disputes
in
the
south
china
sea
finally
we
agreed
to
keep
deepening
our
economic
cooperation
congratulated
president
on
the
reforms
that
pursued
to
make
the
more
competitive
through
our
partnership
for
growth
and
our
millennium
challenge
corporation
compact
going
to
keep
working
together
to
support
these
efforts
so
that
more
can
share
in
this
economic
progress
because
growth
has
to
be
and
it
has
to
be
inclusive
we
discussed
the
steps
that
the
could
take
to
position
itself
for
the
partnership
and
encouraged
the
president
to
seize
the
opportunity
created
by
opening
the
next
phase
of
economic
reform
and
growth
today
announcing
that
my
commerce
secretary
penny
will
lead
delegation
of
american
business
leaders
to
the
this
june
to
explore
new
opportunities
and
add
that
also
committed
to
work
together
to
address
the
devastating
effects
of
climate
change
and
to
make
communities
less
vulnerable
to
extreme
storms
like
so
president
let
me
once
again
thank
you
for
everything
done
to
strengthen
our
alliance
and
our
friendship
looking
forward
to
paying
tribute
to
the
bonds
between
our
people
at
the
dinner
tonight
and
to
working
with
you
as
we
write
the
next
chapter
in
the
relationship
between
our
two
countries
question
good
afternoon
your
excellencies
president
president
welcome
to
the
my
questions
are
how
did
the
united
states
reassure
the
that
the
is
genuinely
committed
to
countering
an
increasingly
assertive
china
in
the
region
will
the
defend
the
in
case
the
territorial
dispute
with
china
in
the
west
sea
or
the
south
china
sea
becomes
an
armed
conflict
and
how
do
you
think
will
china
react
to
the
enhanced
cooperation
agreement
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
that
is
consistent
with
your
position
to
have
the
territorial
disputes
resolved
in
arbitration
thank
you
president
well
been
consistent
throughout
my
travels
in
asia
we
welcome
peaceful
rise
we
have
constructive
relationship
with
china
there
is
enormous
trade
enormous
business
done
between
the
united
states
and
china
there
are
whole
range
of
issues
on
the
international
stage
in
which
cooperation
between
the
and
china
are
vital
so
our
goal
is
not
to
counter
china
our
goal
is
not
to
contain
china
our
goal
is
to
make
sure
that
international
rules
and
norms
are
respected
and
that
includes
in
the
area
of
maritime
disputes
we
do
not
have
claims
in
this
area
territorially
an
asia
pacific
nation
and
our
primary
interest
is
the
peaceful
resolution
of
conflict
the
freedom
of
navigation
that
allows
for
continued
progress
and
prosperity
and
we
even
take
specific
position
on
the
disputes
between
nations
but
as
matter
of
international
law
and
international
norms
we
think
that
coercion
and
intimidation
is
the
way
to
manage
these
disputes
and
for
that
reason
very
supportive
of
president
approach
to
go
before
the
tribunal
for
the
law
of
the
sea
and
to
seek
international
arbitration
that
can
resolve
this
in
diplomatic
fashion
with
respect
to
the
new
cooperation
agreement
been
signed
the
goal
here
is
had
decades
of
alliance
with
the
but
obviously
in
the
century
we
have
to
continue
to
update
that
and
the
goal
for
this
agreement
is
to
build
capacity
to
engage
in
training
to
engage
in
coordination
not
simply
to
deal
with
issues
of
maritime
security
but
also
to
enhance
our
capabilities
so
that
if
natural
disaster
that
takes
place
able
to
potentially
respond
more
quickly
if
there
are
additional
threats
that
may
arise
that
we
are
able
to
work
in
cooperative
fashion
this
is
consistent
with
for
example
the
agreement
that
we
have
with
in
darwin
obviously
had
longstanding
alliance
with
but
we
also
that
as
circumstances
change
as
capacities
change
we
have
to
update
that
alliance
to
meet
new
needs
and
new
challenges
and
so
think
this
is
going
to
be
terrific
opportunity
for
us
to
work
with
the
to
make
sure
that
our
navies
our
air
force
are
coordinated
to
make
sure
that
to
allow
us
to
respond
to
new
threats
and
to
work
with
other
countries
countries
japan
my
hope
is
is
that
at
some
point
going
to
be
able
to
work
cooperatively
with
china
as
well
because
our
goal
here
is
simply
to
make
sure
that
everybody
is
operating
in
peaceful
responsible
fashion
when
that
happens
that
allows
countries
to
focus
on
most
important
to
people
day
to
day
and
that
is
prosperity
growth
jobs
those
are
the
things
that
we
as
leaders
should
be
focused
on
need
to
be
focused
on
and
if
we
have
security
arrangements
that
avoid
conflict
and
dispute
then
able
to
place
our
attention
on
where
we
should
be
focused
the
next
question
comes
from
of
question
president
later
today
we
are
expecting
to
hear
about
new
sanctions
on
people
close
to
president
and
wanted
to
ask
you
do
you
see
this
as
way
to
get
to
personal
wealth
do
you
believe
that
he
has
amassed
personal
wealth
unreported
or
is
it
just
means
of
up
pressure
before
move
to
sectoral
sanctions
you
mentioned
yesterday
specifically
the
industry
as
an
area
where
it
make
sense
to
move
without
europe
moving
wanted
to
ask
you
are
we
likely
to
see
sanctions
soon
banking
and
energy
sanctions
soon
what
kind
of
timeframe
and
then
president
if
may
also
wanted
to
ask
you
about
china
and
the
new
agreement
what
wanted
to
ask
you
is
what
message
should
china
take
away
from
the
and
the
approach
to
russia
and
ukraine
when
it
comes
to
territorial
disputes
and
do
you
believe
that
the
military
agreement
that
just
been
talking
about
will
in
and
of
itself
deter
china
from
being
aggressive
territorially
or
should
the
begin
developing
military
options
that
could
be
possible
contingencies
if
you
needed
to
go
that
course
thanks
president
right
that
later
today
there
will
be
an
announcement
made
and
can
tell
you
that
it
builds
on
the
sanctions
that
were
already
in
place
as
indicated
we
saw
an
opportunity
through
the
geneva
talks
to
move
in
the
direction
of
diplomatic
resolution
to
the
situation
in
ukraine
the
statement
accurately
points
out
that
the
government
in
the
government
has
in
fact
abided
by
that
agreement
and
operated
in
good
faith
and
we
have
not
seen
comparable
efforts
by
the
and
as
consequence
we
are
going
to
be
moving
forward
with
an
expanded
list
of
individuals
and
companies
that
will
be
affected
by
sanctions
they
remain
targeted
we
will
also
focus
on
some
areas
of
exports
to
russia
that
we
think
are
appropriate
to
be
exporting
in
this
kind
of
climate
the
goal
here
is
not
to
go
after
personally
the
goal
is
to
change
his
calculus
with
respect
to
how
the
current
actions
that
engaging
in
in
ukraine
could
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
russian
economy
over
the
long
haul
and
to
encourage
him
to
actually
walk
the
walk
and
not
just
talk
the
talk
when
it
comes
to
diplomatically
resolving
the
crisis
in
ukraine
there
are
specific
steps
that
russia
can
take
and
if
it
takes
those
steps
then
you
can
see
an
election
taking
place
in
ukraine
you
can
see
the
rights
of
all
people
inside
of
ukraine
respected
the
government
has
put
forward
credible
constitutional
reforms
of
the
sort
that
originally
in
the
south
and
east
said
were
part
of
their
grievances
the
failure
to
have
their
voices
heard
and
represented
has
responded
to
those
and
so
path
here
to
resolve
this
but
russia
has
not
yet
chosen
to
move
forward
and
these
sanctions
represent
the
next
stage
in
calibrated
effort
to
change
we
yet
know
whether
going
to
work
and
why
the
next
phase
if
in
fact
we
saw
further
russian
aggression
towards
ukraine
could
be
sectoral
sanctions
less
narrowly
targeted
addressing
sectors
like
banking
or
the
industry
so
those
would
be
more
those
what
be
announcing
today
will
be
building
on
what
already
done
and
continue
to
be
narrowly
focused
but
will
exact
some
additional
costs
on
the
but
we
are
keeping
in
reserve
additional
steps
that
we
could
take
should
the
situation
escalate
further
president
first
of
all
think
china
be
concerned
about
this
agreement
especially
if
you
look
at
what
is
being
contemplated
for
instance
training
for
emergency
disaster
relief
operations
give
you
perfect
example
the
americans
have
the
osprey
aircraft
which
is
quite
significant
upgrade
in
capabilities
in
terms
of
reaching
out
to
very
remote
areas
we
have
comparable
aircraft
we
have
smaller
helicopters
and
we
had
of
our
provinces
devastated
by
typhoon
now
the
training
will
not
just
train
our
people
on
how
to
operate
this
particular
aircraft
but
more
importantly
even
help
the
office
of
civil
for
instance
manage
this
resource
in
case
storm
or
another
natural
disaster
of
the
scale
that
transpired
does
happen
secondly
think
the
statements
that
america
has
been
making
with
regards
to
ukraine
is
the
same
message
that
has
been
said
to
china
and
guess
not
only
by
america
but
so
many
other
countries
china
itself
has
said
repeatedly
that
they
will
and
have
been
conforming
to
international
law
and
the
rest
of
the
world
is
think
saying
we
are
expecting
you
to
confirm
and
by
actions
that
which
you
have
already
been
addressing
by
words
and
not
distort
international
law
the
has
not
just
won
through
arbitration
but
we
did
remind
obviously
the
president
and
our
dialogue
partners
that
in
they
tried
to
come
up
with
code
of
conduct
with
regards
to
the
south
china
sea
and
the
portion
which
the
claims
which
we
call
the
west
sea
and
in
the
anniversary
there
had
still
been
no
progress
even
in
the
meeting
so
the
felt
it
was
timely
to
raise
the
matter
up
and
to
remind
everybody
that
there
is
no
code
of
conduct
that
binds
us
that
sets
the
operational
parameters
for
all
to
manage
any
potential
conflict
and
as
result
of
that
there
has
been
preparatory
meetings
towards
the
formal
meeting
to
try
and
constitute
code
of
conduct
so
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
are
not
threat
militarily
to
any
country
we
even
have
and
have
said
this
often
enough
we
even
have
presently
single
fighter
aircraft
in
our
inventory
now
we
have
think
legitimate
needs
we
have
coastline
we
do
have
an
exclusive
economic
zone
we
do
have
concerns
about
poaching
on
our
waters
and
preserving
the
environment
and
even
protecting
endangered
species
so
think
no
country
should
begrudge
us
our
rights
to
be
able
to
attend
to
our
concerns
and
our
needs
question
good
afternoon
your
excellencies
this
question
goes
to
president
but
would
also
like
to
hear
the
thoughts
of
president
understand
the
tough
balancing
act
that
you
need
to
do
between
china
and
your
allies
in
asia
but
do
you
believe
that
expansionism
is
threat
to
regional
peace
and
stability
and
will
the
mutual
treaty
apply
in
the
event
that
the
territorial
conflict
with
china
escalates
into
an
armed
conflict
president
well
let
me
repeat
what
said
earlier
think
that
it
is
good
for
the
region
and
good
for
the
world
if
china
is
successfully
developing
if
china
is
lifting
more
of
its
people
out
of
poverty
there
are
lot
of
people
in
china
and
the
more
able
to
develop
and
provide
basic
needs
for
their
people
and
work
cooperatively
with
other
countries
in
the
region
only
going
to
strengthen
the
region
not
going
to
weaken
it
do
think
that
as
president
said
very
persuasively
that
china
as
large
country
has
already
asserted
that
it
is
interested
in
abiding
by
international
law
and
really
our
message
to
china
consistently
on
whole
range
of
issues
is
we
want
to
be
partner
with
you
in
upholding
international
law
in
fact
larger
countries
have
greater
responsibility
in
abiding
by
international
norms
and
rules
because
when
we
move
it
can
worry
smaller
countries
if
we
do
it
in
way
consistent
with
international
law
and
think
that
there
are
going
to
be
territorial
disputes
around
the
world
we
have
territorial
disputes
with
some
of
our
closest
allies
suspect
that
there
are
some
islands
and
rocks
in
and
around
canada
and
the
united
states
where
there
are
probably
still
some
arguments
dating
back
to
the
but
we
go
around
sending
ships
and
threatening
folks
what
we
do
is
we
sit
down
and
we
have
some
people
in
room
boring
not
exciting
but
usually
good
way
to
work
out
these
problems
and
work
out
these
issues
and
think
that
all
the
countries
that
spoken
to
in
the
region
during
the
course
of
my
trip
japan
south
korea
malaysia
and
now
the
their
message
has
been
the
same
everywhere
go
which
is
they
would
like
to
resolve
these
issues
peacefully
and
diplomatically
why
think
that
the
approach
that
president
has
been
taking
putting
this
before
international
arbitration
is
sound
one
and
if
china
think
listens
to
its
and
that
another
approach
to
resolve
these
disputes
what
china
will
find
is
got
ready
and
willing
partners
throughout
the
asia
pacific
region
that
want
to
work
with
them
on
trade
and
commerce
and
selling
goods
and
buying
goods
and
inevitable
that
china
is
going
to
be
dominant
power
in
this
region
just
by
sheer
size
nobody
think
denies
that
the
question
is
just
whether
other
countries
in
the
region
are
also
able
to
succeed
and
prosper
on
their
own
terms
and
tend
to
the
various
interests
and
needs
that
they
and
their
people
have
as
well
and
what
we
support
president
think
from
the
onset
our
message
to
china
has
been
think
all
focused
on
achieving
greater
prosperity
for
all
our
respective
peoples
and
prosperity
and
continued
prosperity
does
not
happen
in
vacuum
there
has
to
be
stability
and
in
turn
they
have
responded
that
the
disputes
in
the
south
china
sea
are
not
the
end
all
be
all
of
our
relationships
and
we
have
had
good
cooperation
with
them
on
so
many
different
fronts
and
perhaps
one
could
even
argue
that
this
is
the
only
sore
point
in
our
relationship
now
having
said
that
perhaps
we
have
tried
to
work
on
that
particular
premise
of
building
up
our
ties
on
different
aspects
where
there
is
no
conflict
or
very
little
conflict
and
in
this
particular
instance
have
to
find
the
way
and
means
by
which
we
can
both
achieve
our
respective
goals
which
believe
are
not
or
should
not
be
mutually
exclusive
but
rather
should
be
inclusive
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
do
want
to
strive
for
the
prosperity
of
our
respective
peoples
that
think
has
to
be
the
primordial
concern
rather
than
disputes
on
few
rocks
that
are
not
possible
to
be
inhabited
and
think
in
due
time
given
the
fact
that
so
much
commerce
that
traverses
this
particular
both
in
the
maritime
and
the
air
domain
china
which
has
achieved
its
goals
of
improving
the
life
of
its
people
will
see
the
soundness
of
this
proposal
and
perhaps
will
act
more
shall
we
say
consistently
and
actively
towards
achieving
that
stability
for
all
that
is
our
hope
question
thank
you
to
both
presidents
president
as
journalist
like
to
ask
you
why
journalists
have
been
killed
since
you
took
office
and
understand
that
there
have
only
been
suspects
arrested
in
six
of
those
cases
what
are
you
doing
to
fix
that
president
as
you
grappled
here
with
all
these
national
security
challenges
have
two
questions
one
back
home
learned
that
military
veterans
died
while
they
were
waiting
for
health
care
very
tragic
situation
know
you
run
the
phoenix
office
of
veterans
affairs
but
as
what
specifically
will
you
pledge
to
fix
that
and
secondly
more
broadly
big
picture
as
you
end
this
trip
think
have
to
remind
you
there
have
been
lot
of
unflattering
portraits
of
your
foreign
policy
right
now
and
rather
than
get
into
all
the
details
or
red
lines
like
to
give
you
chance
to
lay
out
what
your
vision
is
more
than
five
years
into
office
what
you
think
the
doctrine
is
in
terms
of
what
your
guiding
principle
is
on
all
of
these
crises
and
how
you
answer
those
critics
who
say
they
think
the
doctrine
is
weakness
president
well
doubt
that
going
to
have
time
to
lay
out
my
entire
foreign
policy
doctrine
and
there
are
actually
some
complimentary
pieces
as
well
about
my
foreign
policy
but
not
sure
you
ran
them
think
the
general
takeaway
from
this
trip
our
alliances
in
the
asia
pacific
have
never
been
stronger
can
say
that
unequivocally
our
relationship
with
countries
in
asia
have
never
been
stronger
think
subject
to
dispute
as
recently
as
decade
ago
there
were
great
tensions
between
us
and
malaysia
for
example
and
think
you
just
witnessed
the
incredible
warmth
and
strength
of
the
relationship
between
those
two
countries
here
in
the
signing
agreement
ten
years
ago
fifteen
years
ago
there
was
enormous
tensions
around
our
relationship
with
the
and
so
hard
to
square
whatever
it
is
that
the
critics
are
saying
with
facts
on
the
ground
events
on
the
ground
here
in
the
asia
pacific
region
typically
criticism
of
our
foreign
policy
has
been
directed
at
the
failure
to
use
military
force
and
the
question
think
would
have
is
why
is
it
that
everybody
is
so
eager
to
use
military
force
after
just
gone
through
decade
of
war
at
enormous
costs
to
our
troops
and
to
our
budget
and
what
is
it
exactly
that
these
critics
think
would
have
been
accomplished
my
job
as
is
to
deploy
military
force
as
last
resort
and
to
deploy
it
wisely
and
frankly
most
of
the
foreign
policy
commentators
that
have
questioned
our
policies
would
go
headlong
into
bunch
of
military
adventures
that
the
american
people
had
no
interest
in
participating
in
and
would
not
advance
our
core
security
interests
so
if
you
look
at
syria
for
example
our
interest
is
in
helping
the
syrian
people
but
nobody
suggests
that
us
being
involved
in
land
war
in
syria
would
necessarily
accomplish
this
goal
and
would
note
that
those
who
our
foreign
policy
with
respect
to
syria
they
themselves
say
no
no
no
we
mean
sending
in
troops
well
what
do
you
mean
well
you
should
be
assisting
the
opposition
well
assisting
the
opposition
what
else
do
you
mean
well
perhaps
you
should
have
taken
strike
in
syria
to
get
chemical
weapons
out
of
syria
well
it
turns
out
getting
chemical
weapons
out
of
syria
without
having
initiated
strike
so
what
else
are
you
talking
about
and
at
that
point
it
kind
of
trails
off
in
ukraine
what
done
is
the
international
community
russia
has
never
been
more
isolated
country
that
used
to
be
clearly
in
its
orbit
now
is
looking
much
more
towards
europe
and
the
west
because
seen
that
the
arrangements
that
have
existed
for
the
last
years
working
for
them
and
russia
is
having
to
engage
in
activities
that
have
been
rejected
uniformly
around
the
world
and
been
able
to
the
international
community
to
not
only
put
diplomatic
pressure
on
russia
but
also
been
able
to
european
countries
who
many
were
would
do
anything
to
work
with
us
in
applying
sanctions
to
russia
well
what
else
should
we
be
doing
well
we
be
putting
troops
in
the
critics
will
say
not
what
we
mean
well
okay
what
are
you
saying
well
we
should
be
arming
the
more
do
people
actually
think
that
somehow
us
sending
some
additional
arms
into
ukraine
could
potentially
deter
the
russian
army
or
are
we
more
likely
to
deter
them
by
applying
the
sort
of
international
pressure
diplomatic
pressure
and
economic
pressure
that
applying
the
point
is
that
for
some
reason
many
who
were
proponents
of
what
consider
to
be
disastrous
decision
to
go
into
iraq
really
learned
the
lesson
of
the
last
decade
and
they
keep
on
just
playing
the
same
note
over
and
over
again
why
know
but
my
job
as
is
to
look
at
what
is
it
that
is
going
to
advance
our
security
interests
over
the
long
term
to
keep
our
military
in
reserve
for
where
we
absolutely
need
it
there
are
going
to
be
times
where
there
are
disasters
and
difficulties
and
challenges
all
around
the
world
and
not
all
of
those
are
going
to
be
immediately
solvable
by
us
but
we
can
continue
to
speak
out
clearly
about
what
we
believe
where
we
can
make
difference
using
all
the
tools
got
in
the
well
we
should
do
so
and
if
there
are
occasions
where
targeted
clear
actions
can
be
taken
that
would
make
difference
then
we
should
take
them
we
do
do
them
because
somebody
sitting
in
an
office
in
washington
or
new
york
think
it
would
look
strong
that
not
how
we
make
foreign
policy
and
if
you
look
at
the
results
of
what
we
done
over
the
last
five
years
it
is
fair
to
say
that
our
alliances
are
stronger
our
partnerships
are
stronger
and
in
the
asia
pacific
region
just
to
take
one
example
we
are
much
better
positioned
to
work
with
the
peoples
here
on
whole
range
of
issues
of
mutual
interest
and
that
may
not
always
be
sexy
that
may
not
always
attract
lot
of
attention
and
it
make
for
good
argument
on
sunday
morning
shows
but
it
avoids
errors
you
hit
singles
you
hit
doubles
every
once
in
while
we
may
be
able
to
hit
home
run
but
we
steadily
advance
the
interests
of
the
american
people
and
our
partnership
with
folks
around
the
world
question
the
veterans
affairs
president
you
got
me
all
worked
up
on
the
other
one
the
moment
we
heard
about
the
allegations
around
these
individuals
who
had
died
in
phoenix
immediately
ordered
the
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
general
to
investigate
we
also
have
an
investigation
taking
place
and
so
we
take
the
allegations
very
seriously
that
is
consistent
with
what
has
been
my
commitment
to
make
sure
that
our
veterans
are
cared
for
believe
that
if
somebody
has
served
our
nation
then
they
have
to
get
the
benefits
and
services
that
they
have
earned
and
my
budgets
have
consistently
reflected
that
that
why
resourced
the
veterans
affairs
office
more
in
terms
of
increases
than
any
other
department
or
agency
in
my
government
that
mean
though
that
some
folks
may
still
not
be
getting
the
help
that
they
need
and
we
going
to
find
out
if
in
fact
that
the
case
and
interested
in
working
with
everybody
whether
it
our
outstanding
veteran
service
or
congress
to
make
sure
that
there
is
not
single
veteran
in
the
united
states
who
needs
help
whether
because
homeless
because
sick
because
looking
for
job
want
to
make
sure
that
they
are
getting
the
help
that
they
need
president
with
regards
to
the
killing
of
journalists
perhaps
we
should
say
from
the
outset
that
do
have
the
figures
right
here
before
me
but
we
did
set
up
an
committee
to
look
on
killings
and
forced
disappearances
torture
and
other
grave
violations
of
right
to
life
liberty
and
security
of
persons
and
in
this
particular
body
there
has
been
have
the
figures
for
issues
there
were
suspected
cases
of
extrajudicial
killings
referred
to
it
and
of
the
investigations
before
this
committee
there
have
been
that
have
been
determined
to
the
criteria
and
the
definitions
of
what
constitutes
an
extrajudicial
killing
of
the
cases
that
have
been
determined
to
be
possible
cases
only
one
happened
during
our
watch
the
case
of
now
as
far
as
journalists
are
concerned
perhaps
the
track
record
speaks
for
itself
the
massacre
involved
something
like
journalists
and
there
are
presently
something
like
over
people
who
have
been
indicted
for
this
crime
and
are
undergoing
trial
that
mean
that
we
have
stopped
trying
to
look
for
others
potentially
involved
in
this
particular
killing
and
may
we
just
state
for
the
record
that
even
when
it
comes
to
journalists
it
is
not
policy
of
this
state
to
silence
critics
all
you
have
to
do
would
be
to
turn
on
the
the
radio
or
look
at
any
newspaper
to
find
an
abundance
of
criticisms
now
having
said
that
investigations
have
been
done
anybody
who
has
been
killed
obviously
is
victim
and
investigations
have
been
ongoing
if
at
times
we
do
not
reveal
the
discoveries
by
our
intelligence
agencies
and
security
services
perhaps
we
are
very
sensitive
to
personal
relationships
by
the
people
who
are
deceased
who
were
killed
not
because
of
professional
activities
but
shall
we
say
other
issues
but
having
said
that
they
were
killed
that
is
against
the
law
and
the
people
will
have
to
be
found
prosecuted
and
sent
to
jail
the
fourth
plank
of
my
promise
when
ran
for
election
was
judicial
reform
and
this
is
still
work
in
progress
we
want
to
protect
all
the
rights
of
every
individual
but
also
ensure
that
the
speedy
portion
of
the
promise
also
happens
unfortunately
speed
is
not
hallmark
of
our
current
judicial
system
and
there
are
various
steps
laws
amendments
particular
laws
even
rethink
of
the
whole
process
to
try
and
ensure
the
speedy
disposition
of
justice
thank
you
president
thank
you
very
much
everybody
hello

shipyard
wall
to
lead
strike

became
movement
the

this
nation
thank

your
outstanding

of
poland

your
extraordinary
welcome
and
for
the
privilege
of
joining
you
here
today
bring
with
me
the
greetings
and
friendship
of
the
american
people
and
of
my
of
chicago
home
to
so
many
proud
polish
americans
in
chicago
we
think
of
ourselves
as
little
piece
of
poland
in
some
you
only
hear
polish
the
faithful
come
together
at
churches
like
saint
we
have
parade
for
polish
constitution
day
and
every
summer
we
celebrate
the
taste
of
with
our
and
and
all
little
bit
polish
for
that
day
so
being
here
with
you
it
feels
like
home
years
ago
today
we
witnessed
scene
that
had
once
seemed
impossible
an
election
where
for
the
first
time
the
people
of
this
nation
had
choice
the
communist
regime
thought
an
election
would
validate
their
rule
or
weaken
the
opposition
instead
poles
turned
out
in
the
millions
and
when
the
votes
were
counted
it
was
landslide
victory
for
freedom
one
woman
who
voted
that
day
said
is
sense
that
something
is
beginning
to
happen
in
poland
we
feel
the
taste
of
poland
she
was
right
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
communism
not
just
in
this
country
but
across
europe
the
images
of
that
year
are
seared
in
our
memory
citizens
filling
the
streets
of
budapest
and
and
cutting
the
barbed
wire
border
protestors
joining
hands
across
the
czechs
and
in
their
velvet
revolution
east
climbing
atop
that
wall
and
we
have
seen
the
extraordinary
progress
since
that
time
united
germany
nations
in
central
and
eastern
europe
standing
tall
as
proud
democracies
europe
that
is
more
integrated
more
prosperous
and
more
secure
we
must
never
forget
that
the
spark
for
so
much
of
this
revolutionary
change
this
blossoming
of
hope
was
lit
by
you
the
people
of
poland
history
was
made
here
the
victory
of
was
not
inevitable
it
was
the
culmination
of
centuries
of
polish
struggle
at
times
in
this
very
square
the
generations
of
poles
who
rose
up
and
finally
won
independence
the
soldiers
who
resisted
invasion
from
the
east
and
the
west
the
righteous
among
the
nations
among
them
who
risked
all
to
save
the
innocent
from
the
holocaust
the
of
the
warsaw
ghetto
who
refused
to
go
without
fight
the
free
poles
at
normandy
and
the
poles
of
the
home
army
who
even
as
this
city
was
reduced
to
rubble
waged
heroic
uprising
we
remember
how
when
an
iron
curtain
descended
you
never
accepted
your
fate
when
son
of
poland
ascended
to
the
chair
of
saint
peter
he
returned
home
and
here
in
warsaw
he
inspired
nation
with
his
words
can
be
no
just
europe
without
the
independence
of
and
today
we
give
thanks
for
the
courage
of
the
catholic
church
and
the
fearless
spirit
of
saint
john
paul
we
also
recall
how
you
prevailed
years
ago
in
the
face
of
beatings
and
bullets
you
never
wavered
from
the
moral
force
of
nonviolence
through
the
darkness
of
martial
law
poles
lit
candles
in
their
windows
when
the
regime
finally
agreed
to
talk
you
embraced
dialogue
when
they
held
those
elections
even
though
not
fully
free
you
participated
as
one
solidarity
leader
said
at
the
time
decided
to
accept
what
was
poland
reminds
us
that
sometimes
the
smallest
steps
however
imperfect
can
ultimately
tear
down
walls
can
ultimately
transform
the
world
but
of
course
your
victory
that
june
day
was
only
the
beginning
for
democracy
is
more
than
just
elections
true
democracy
real
prosperity
lasting
security
these
are
neither
simply
given
nor
imposed
from
the
outside
they
must
be
earned
and
built
from
within
and
in
that
contest
of
ideas
between
freedom
and
authoritarianism
between
liberty
and
oppression
between
solidarity
and
intolerance
progress
shows
the
enduring
strength
of
the
ideals
that
we
cherish
as
free
people
here
we
see
the
strength
of
democracy
citizens
raising
their
voices
free
from
fear
here
we
see
political
parties
competing
in
open
and
honest
elections
here
we
see
an
independent
judiciary
working
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
here
in
poland
we
see
vibrant
press
and
growing
civil
society
that
holds
leaders
accountable
because
governments
exist
to
lift
up
their
people
not
to
hold
them
down
here
we
see
the
strength
of
free
markets
and
the
results
of
hard
reforms
gleaming
skyscrapers
soaring
above
the
city
and
across
this
country
hubs
and
living
standards
that
previous
generations
of
poles
could
only
imagine
this
is
the
new
poland
you
have
built
an
economic
on
the
cud
here
we
see
the
strength
of
free
nations
that
stand
united
across
those
centuries
of
struggle
fate
too
often
was
dictated
by
others
this
land
was
invaded
and
conquered
carved
up
and
occupied
but
those
days
are
over
poland
understands
as
few
other
nations
do
that
every
nation
must
be
free
to
chart
its
own
course
to
forge
its
own
partnerships
to
choose
its
own
allies
this
year
marks
the
anniversary
of
membership
in
nato
we
polish
service
in
the
in
iraq
and
and
as
americans
we
are
proud
to
call
poland
one
of
our
strongest
and
closest
allies
this
is
the
poland
we
celebrate
today
the
free
and
democratic
poland
that
your
forebears
and
some
who
are
here
today
dreamed
of
and
fought
for
and
in
some
cases
died
for
the
growing
and
secure
poland
that
you
particularly
the
young
people
who
are
here
today
have
enjoyed
for
your
entire
lives
wonderful
story
but
the
story
of
this
nation
reminds
us
that
freedom
is
not
guaranteed
and
history
cautions
us
to
never
take
progress
for
granted
on
the
same
day
years
ago
that
poles
were
voting
here
tanks
were
crushing
peaceful
democracy
protests
in
square
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
the
blessings
of
liberty
must
be
earned
and
renewed
by
every
generation
including
our
own
this
is
the
work
to
which
we
ourselves
today
our
democracies
must
be
defined
not
by
what
or
who
against
but
by
politics
of
inclusion
and
tolerance
that
welcomes
all
our
citizens
our
economies
must
deliver
broader
prosperity
that
creates
more
opportunity
across
europe
and
across
the
world
especially
for
young
people
leaders
must
uphold
the
public
trust
and
stand
against
corruption
not
steal
from
the
pockets
of
their
own
people
our
societies
must
embrace
greater
justice
that
the
inherent
dignity
of
every
human
being
and
as
been
reminded
by
aggression
in
ukraine
our
free
nations
can
not
be
complacent
in
pursuit
of
the
vision
we
share
europe
that
is
whole
and
free
and
at
peace
we
have
to
work
for
that
we
have
to
stand
with
those
who
seek
freedom
know
that
throughout
history
the
polish
people
were
abandoned
by
friends
when
you
needed
them
most
so
come
to
warsaw
today
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
nato
alliance
to
reaffirm
our
unwavering
commitment
to
security
article
is
clear
an
attack
on
one
is
an
attack
on
all
and
as
allies
we
have
solemn
duty
binding
treaty
obligation
to
defend
your
territorial
integrity
and
we
will
we
stand
together
now
and
forever
for
your
freedom
is
ours
poland
will
never
stand
alone
but
not
just
poland
estonia
will
never
stand
alone
latvia
will
never
stand
alone
will
never
stand
alone
will
never
stand
alone
these
are
not
just
words
unbreakable
commitments
backed
by
the
strongest
alliance
in
the
world
and
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
most
powerful
military
in
history
you
see
our
commitment
today
in
nato
aircraft
in
the
skies
of
the
in
allied
ships
patrolling
the
black
sea
in
the
exercises
where
our
forces
train
together
and
in
our
increased
and
enduring
american
presence
here
on
polish
soil
we
do
these
things
not
to
threaten
any
nation
but
to
defend
the
security
and
territory
of
ourselves
and
our
friends
yesterday
announced
new
initiative
to
bolster
the
security
of
our
nato
allies
and
increase
military
presence
in
europe
with
the
support
of
congress
this
will
mean
more
equipment
to
respond
quickly
in
crisis
and
exercises
and
training
to
keep
our
forces
ready
additional
forces
in
the
air
and
sea
and
on
land
including
here
in
poland
and
it
will
mean
increased
support
to
help
friends
like
ukraine
and
and
georgia
provide
for
their
own
just
as
the
united
states
is
increasing
our
commitment
so
must
others
every
nato
member
is
protected
by
our
alliance
and
every
nato
member
must
carry
its
share
in
our
alliance
this
is
the
responsibility
we
have
to
each
other
finally
as
free
peoples
we
join
together
not
simply
to
safeguard
our
own
security
but
to
advance
the
freedom
of
others
today
we
affirm
the
principles
for
which
we
stand
we
stand
together
because
we
believe
that
people
and
nations
have
the
right
to
determine
their
own
destiny
and
that
includes
the
people
of
ukraine
robbed
by
corrupt
regime
demanded
government
that
served
them
beaten
and
bloodied
they
refused
to
yield
threatened
and
harassed
they
lined
up
to
vote
they
elected
new
president
in
free
election
because
legitimacy
can
only
come
from
the
consent
of
the
people
have
now
embarked
on
the
hard
road
of
reform
met
with
this
morning
and
told
him
that
just
as
free
nations
offered
support
and
assistance
to
poland
in
your
transition
to
democracy
we
stand
with
now
ukraine
must
be
free
to
choose
its
own
future
for
itself
and
by
itself
we
reject
the
thinking
of
the
past
free
and
independent
ukraine
needs
strong
ties
and
growing
trade
with
europe
and
russia
and
the
united
states
and
the
rest
of
the
world
because
the
people
of
ukraine
are
reaching
out
for
the
same
freedom
and
opportunities
and
progress
that
we
celebrate
here
today
and
they
deserve
them
too
we
stand
together
because
we
believe
that
upholding
peace
and
security
is
the
responsibility
of
every
nation
the
days
of
empire
and
spheres
of
influence
are
over
bigger
nations
must
not
be
allowed
to
bully
the
small
or
impose
their
will
at
the
barrel
of
gun
or
with
masked
men
taking
over
buildings
and
the
stroke
of
pen
can
never
the
theft
of
land
so
we
will
not
accept
occupation
of
crimea
or
its
violation
of
sovereignty
our
free
nations
will
stand
united
so
that
further
russian
provocations
will
only
mean
more
isolation
and
costs
for
russia
because
after
investing
so
much
blood
and
treasure
to
bring
europe
together
how
can
we
allow
the
dark
tactics
of
the
century
to
define
this
new
century
we
stand
together
because
we
know
that
the
spirit
of
warsaw
and
budapest
and
prague
and
berlin
stretches
to
wherever
the
longing
for
freedom
stirs
in
human
hearts
whether
in
or
or
damascus
or
wherever
people
are
willing
to
do
the
hard
work
of
building
democracy
from
to
from
to
they
will
have
partner
in
our
nations
for
in
the
struggles
of
these
citizens
we
recall
our
own
struggles
in
their
faces
we
see
our
own
and
few
see
this
more
clearly
than
the
people
of
poland
the
of
today
are
the
heirs
of
solidarity
men
and
women
like
you
who
dared
to
challenge
bankrupt
regime
when
your
peaceful
protests
were
met
with
an
iron
fist
poles
placed
flowers
in
the
shipyard
gate
today
their
fallen
with
flowers
in
independence
square
we
remember
the
polish
voter
who
rejoiced
to
the
taste
of
poland
her
voice
in
the
young
protestor
in
the
who
what
she
called
taste
of
real
love
my
country
she
said
and
we
are
standing
up
for
and
and
with
gratitude
for
the
strong
support
of
the
polish
people
she
spoke
for
many
when
she
said
you
poland
we
hear
you
and
we
love
today
we
can
say
the
same
thank
you
poland
thank
you
for
your
courage
thank
you
for
reminding
the
world
that
no
matter
how
brutal
the
crackdown
no
matter
how
long
the
night
the
yearning
for
liberty
and
dignity
does
not
fade
away
it
will
never
go
away
thank
you
poland
for
your
iron
will
and
for
showing
that
yes
ordinary
citizens
can
grab
the
reins
of
history
and
that
freedom
will
prevail
because
in
the
end
tanks
and
troops
are
no
match
for
the
force
of
our
ideals
thank
you
poland
for
your
triumph
not
of
arms
but
of
the
human
spirit
the
truth
that
carries
us
forward
there
is
no
change
without
risk
and
no
progress
without
sacrifice
and
no
freedom
without
solidarity
god
bless
poland
god
bless
america
god
bless
our
unbreakable
alliance
thank
you
very
much
good
afternoon
everybody
one
year
ago
this
month
senators
of
both
parties
with
support
from
the
business
law
enforcement
faith
communities
came
together
to
pass
commonsense
immigration
bill
independent
experts
said
that
bill
would
strengthen
our
borders
grow
our
economy
shrink
our
deficits
as
we
speak
there
are
enough
republicans
and
democrats
in
the
house
to
pass
an
immigration
bill
today
would
sign
it
into
law
today
and
washington
would
solve
problem
in
bipartisan
way
but
for
more
than
year
republicans
in
the
house
of
representatives
have
refused
to
allow
an
vote
on
that
senate
bill
or
any
legislation
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
and
held
off
on
pressuring
them
for
long
time
to
give
speaker
the
space
he
needed
to
get
his
fellow
republicans
on
board
meanwhile
what
year
of
obstruction
has
meant
it
has
meant
fewer
resources
to
strengthen
our
borders
meant
more
businesses
free
to
game
the
system
by
hiring
undocumented
workers
which
punishes
businesses
that
play
by
the
rules
and
drives
down
wages
for
hardworking
americans
meant
lost
talent
when
the
best
and
brightest
from
around
the
world
come
to
study
here
but
are
forced
to
leave
and
then
compete
against
our
businesses
and
our
workers
meant
no
chance
for
million
immigrants
to
come
out
of
the
shadows
and
earn
their
citizenship
if
they
pay
penalty
and
pass
background
check
pay
their
fair
share
of
taxes
learn
english
and
go
to
the
back
of
the
line
meant
the
heartbreak
of
separated
families
what
this
obstruction
has
meant
over
the
past
year
what
the
senate
bill
would
fix
if
the
house
allowed
it
to
go
to
vote
our
country
and
our
economy
would
be
stronger
today
if
house
republicans
had
allowed
simple
vote
on
this
bill
or
for
that
matter
any
bill
be
following
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
american
people
who
support
reform
instead
proven
again
and
again
that
unwilling
to
stand
up
to
the
tea
party
in
order
to
do
best
for
the
country
and
the
worst
part
about
it
is
bunch
of
them
know
better
we
now
have
an
actual
humanitarian
crisis
on
the
border
that
only
the
need
to
drop
the
politics
and
fix
our
immigration
system
once
and
for
all
in
recent
weeks
seen
surge
of
unaccompanied
children
arrive
at
the
border
brought
here
and
to
other
countries
by
smugglers
and
traffickers
the
journey
is
unbelievably
dangerous
for
these
kids
the
children
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
survive
it
will
be
taken
care
of
while
they
go
through
the
legal
process
but
in
most
cases
that
process
will
lead
to
them
being
sent
back
home
sent
clear
message
to
parents
in
these
countries
not
to
put
their
kids
through
this
recently
sent
vice
president
to
meet
with
central
american
leaders
and
find
ways
to
address
the
root
causes
of
this
crisis
secretary
will
also
be
meeting
with
those
leaders
again
tomorrow
with
our
international
partners
taking
new
steps
to
go
after
the
dangerous
smugglers
who
are
putting
thousands
of
lives
at
risk
today
sent
letter
to
congressional
leaders
asking
that
they
work
with
me
to
address
the
urgent
humanitarian
challenge
on
the
border
and
support
the
immigration
and
border
patrol
agents
who
already
apprehend
and
deport
hundreds
of
thousands
of
undocumented
immigrants
every
year
and
understand
by
the
way
for
the
most
part
this
is
not
situation
where
these
children
are
slipping
through
being
apprehended
but
the
problem
is
is
that
our
system
is
so
broken
so
unclear
that
folks
know
what
the
rules
are
now
understand
there
are
number
of
republicans
who
have
been
willing
to
work
with
us
to
pass
real
commonsense
immigration
reform
and
want
to
thank
them
for
their
efforts
there
are
number
of
republican
leaders
in
the
senate
who
did
excellent
work
and
deserve
our
thanks
and
less
visibly
there
have
been
folks
in
the
house
who
have
been
trying
to
work
to
get
this
done
and
quietly
because
it
always
help
me
to
praise
them
expressed
to
them
how
much
appreciate
the
efforts
that
made
believe
speaker
when
he
says
he
wants
to
pass
an
immigration
bill
think
he
genuinely
wants
to
get
something
done
but
last
week
he
informed
me
that
republicans
will
continue
to
block
vote
on
immigration
reform
at
least
for
the
remainder
of
this
year
some
in
the
house
republican
caucus
are
using
the
situation
with
unaccompanied
children
as
their
newest
excuse
to
do
nothing
now
want
everybody
to
think
about
that
their
argument
seems
to
be
that
because
the
system
is
broken
we
make
an
effort
to
fix
it
it
makes
no
sense
not
on
the
level
just
politics
plain
and
simple
now
there
are
others
in
the
republican
caucus
in
the
house
who
are
arguing
that
they
act
because
mad
at
me
about
using
my
executive
authority
too
broadly
this
also
makes
no
sense
prefer
taking
administrative
action
rather
see
permanent
fixes
to
the
issue
we
face
certainly
true
on
immigration
made
that
clear
multiple
times
would
love
nothing
more
than
bipartisan
legislation
to
pass
the
house
the
senate
land
on
my
desk
so
can
sign
it
true
about
immigration
true
about
the
minimum
wage
true
about
equal
pay
there
are
whole
bunch
of
things
where
would
greatly
prefer
congress
actually
do
something
take
executive
action
only
when
we
have
serious
problem
serious
issue
and
congress
chooses
to
do
nothing
and
in
this
situation
the
failure
of
house
republicans
to
pass
darn
bill
is
bad
for
our
security
bad
for
our
economy
and
bad
for
our
future
so
while
will
continue
to
push
house
republicans
to
drop
the
excuses
and
act
and
hope
their
constituents
will
too
america
can
not
wait
forever
for
them
to
act
and
why
today
beginning
new
effort
to
fix
as
much
of
our
immigration
system
as
can
on
my
own
without
congress
as
first
step
directing
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
and
the
attorney
general
to
move
available
and
appropriate
resources
from
our
interior
to
the
border
protecting
public
safety
and
deporting
dangerous
criminals
has
been
and
will
remain
the
top
priority
but
we
are
going
to
refocus
our
efforts
where
we
can
to
make
sure
we
do
what
it
takes
to
keep
our
border
secure
have
also
directed
secretary
and
attorney
general
holder
to
identify
additional
actions
my
administration
can
take
on
our
own
within
my
existing
legal
authorities
to
do
what
congress
refuses
to
do
and
fix
as
much
of
our
immigration
system
as
we
can
if
congress
will
not
do
their
job
at
least
we
can
do
ours
expect
their
recommendations
before
the
end
of
summer
and
intend
to
adopt
those
recommendations
without
further
delay
of
course
even
with
aggressive
steps
on
my
part
administrative
action
alone
will
not
adequately
address
the
problem
the
reforms
that
will
do
the
most
to
strengthen
our
businesses
our
workers
and
our
entire
economy
will
still
require
an
act
of
congress
and
repeat
these
are
reforms
that
already
enjoy
the
wide
support
of
the
american
people
very
rare
where
you
get
business
evangelicals
law
enforcement
all
agreeing
on
what
needs
to
be
done
and
at
some
point
that
should
be
enough
normally
that
is
enough
the
point
of
public
service
is
to
solve
public
problems
and
those
of
us
who
have
the
privilege
to
serve
have
responsibility
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
americans
safe
and
to
keep
the
doors
of
opportunity
open
and
if
we
do
then
one
year
from
now
not
only
would
our
economy
and
our
security
be
stronger
but
maybe
the
best
and
the
brightest
from
around
the
world
who
come
study
here
would
stay
and
create
jobs
here
maybe
companies
that
play
by
the
rules
will
no
longer
be
undercut
by
companies
that
maybe
more
families
been
living
here
for
years
whose
children
are
often
citizens
who
are
our
and
our
friends
whose
children
are
our
friends
and
go
to
school
with
them
and
play
on
ball
teams
with
them
maybe
those
families
would
get
to
stay
together
but
much
of
this
only
happens
if
americans
continue
to
push
congress
to
get
this
done
so
told
speaker
that
even
as
take
those
steps
that
can
within
my
existing
legal
authorities
to
make
the
immigration
system
work
better
going
to
continue
to
reach
out
to
house
republicans
in
the
hope
that
they
deliver
more
permanent
solution
with
comprehensive
bill
maybe
it
will
be
after
the
when
less
worried
about
politics
maybe
it
will
be
next
year
whenever
it
is
they
will
find
me
willing
partner
have
been
consistent
in
saying
that
am
prepared
to
work
with
them
even
on
bill
that
do
consider
perfect
and
the
senate
bill
was
good
example
of
the
capacity
to
compromise
and
get
this
done
the
only
thing
do
is
stand
by
and
do
nothing
while
waiting
for
them
to
get
their
act
together
and
want
to
repeat
what
said
earlier
if
house
republicans
are
really
concerned
about
me
taking
too
many
executive
actions
the
best
solution
to
that
is
passing
bills
pass
bill
solve
problem
do
just
say
no
on
something
that
everybody
agrees
needs
to
be
done
because
if
we
pass
bill
that
will
supplant
whatever
done
administratively
have
structure
there
that
works
and
it
will
be
permanent
and
people
can
make
plans
and
businesses
can
make
plans
based
on
the
law
and
there
will
be
clarity
both
here
inside
this
country
and
outside
it
let
me
just
close
by
saying
friday
is
the
fourth
of
july
the
day
we
celebrate
our
independence
and
all
the
things
that
make
this
country
so
great
and
each
year
and
host
few
hundred
and
wounded
warriors
and
their
families
right
here
on
the
lawn
for
barbecue
and
fireworks
on
the
mall
and
some
of
the
coming
this
year
are
unique
because
they
signed
up
to
serve
to
sacrifice
potentially
to
give
their
lives
for
the
security
of
this
country
even
though
they
yet
americans
that
how
much
they
love
this
country
they
were
prepared
to
fight
and
die
for
an
america
they
did
not
yet
fully
belong
to
think
earned
their
stripes
in
more
ways
than
one
and
why
on
friday
morning
going
to
them
in
ceremony
right
here
at
the
white
house
this
independence
day
will
be
their
first
day
as
american
citizens
one
of
the
things
we
celebrate
on
friday
one
of
the
things
that
make
this
country
great
is
that
we
are
nation
of
immigrants
our
people
come
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
that
what
makes
us
special
that
what
makes
us
unique
and
throughout
our
history
come
here
in
wave
after
wave
from
everywhere
understanding
that
there
was
something
about
this
place
where
the
whole
was
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
that
all
the
different
cultures
and
ideas
and
energy
would
come
together
and
create
something
new
we
won
this
freedom
together
we
built
this
country
together
we
defended
this
country
together
it
makes
us
special
it
makes
us
strong
it
makes
us
americans
worth
celebrating
and
that
what
want
not
just
house
republicans
but
all
of
us
as
americans
to
remember
thanks
very
much
good
morning
everybody
yesterday
airlines
flight
took
off
from
and
was
shot
down
over
ukraine
near
the
russian
border
nearly
innocent
lives
were
taken
men
women
children
infants
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
crisis
in
ukraine
their
deaths
are
an
outrage
of
unspeakable
proportions
we
know
at
least
one
american
citizen
was
killed
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
his
family
for
this
terrible
loss
yesterday
spoke
with
the
leaders
of
ukraine
malaysia
and
the
told
them
that
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
all
the
families
and
that
the
american
people
stand
with
them
during
this
difficult
time
later
today
be
speaking
to
prime
minister
of
which
also
suffered
terrible
loss
by
far
the
country
that
lost
the
most
people
on
board
the
plane
was
the
from
the
days
of
our
founding
the
dutch
have
been
close
friends
and
stalwart
allies
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
today
want
the
dutch
people
to
know
that
we
stand
with
you
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
our
grief
and
in
our
absolute
determination
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened
what
we
know
so
far
evidence
indicates
that
the
plane
was
shot
down
by
missile
that
was
launched
from
an
area
that
is
controlled
by
separatists
inside
of
ukraine
we
also
know
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
plane
has
been
shot
down
in
eastern
ukraine
over
the
last
several
weeks
separatists
have
shot
down
transport
plane
and
helicopter
and
they
claimed
responsibility
for
shooting
down
fighter
jet
moreover
we
know
that
these
separatists
have
received
steady
flow
of
support
from
russia
this
includes
arms
and
training
it
includes
heavy
weapons
and
it
includes
weapons
what
must
happen
now
this
was
global
tragedy
an
asian
airliner
was
destroyed
in
european
skies
filled
with
citizens
from
many
countries
so
there
has
to
be
credible
international
investigation
into
what
happened
the
security
council
has
endorsed
this
investigation
and
we
will
hold
all
its
members
including
russia
to
their
word
in
order
to
facilitate
that
investigation
russia
separatists
and
ukraine
must
adhere
to
an
immediate
evidence
must
not
be
tampered
with
investigators
need
to
access
the
crash
site
and
the
solemn
task
of
returning
those
who
were
lost
on
board
the
plane
to
their
loved
ones
needs
to
go
forward
immediately
the
united
states
stands
ready
to
provide
any
assistance
that
is
necessary
already
offered
the
support
of
the
and
the
national
transportation
safety
board
which
has
experience
in
working
with
international
partners
on
these
types
of
investigations
they
are
on
their
way
personnel
from
the
and
the
national
transportation
safety
board
in
the
coming
hours
and
days
continue
to
be
in
close
contact
with
leaders
from
around
the
world
as
we
respond
to
this
catastrophe
our
immediate
focus
will
be
on
recovering
those
who
were
lost
investigating
exactly
what
happened
and
putting
forward
the
facts
want
to
point
out
there
will
likely
be
misinformation
as
well
think
it
very
important
for
folks
to
sift
through
what
is
factually
based
and
what
is
simply
speculation
no
one
can
deny
the
truth
that
is
revealed
in
the
awful
images
that
we
all
have
seen
and
the
eyes
of
the
world
are
on
eastern
ukraine
and
we
are
going
to
make
sure
that
the
truth
is
out
more
broadly
think
it
important
for
us
to
that
this
outrageous
event
that
it
is
time
for
peace
and
security
to
be
restored
in
ukraine
for
months
supported
pathway
to
peace
and
the
government
has
reached
out
to
all
put
forward
peace
plan
and
lived
up
to
despite
repeated
violations
by
the
separatists
violations
that
took
the
lives
of
soldiers
and
personnel
moreover
time
and
again
russia
has
refused
to
take
the
concrete
steps
necessary
to
the
situation
spoke
to
president
yesterday
in
the
wake
of
additional
sanctions
that
we
had
imposed
he
said
he
happy
with
them
and
told
him
that
we
have
been
very
clear
from
the
outset
that
we
want
russia
to
take
the
path
that
would
result
in
peace
in
ukraine
but
so
far
at
least
russia
has
failed
to
take
that
path
instead
it
has
continued
to
violate
sovereignty
and
to
support
violent
separatists
it
has
also
failed
to
use
its
influence
to
press
the
separatists
to
abide
by
why
together
with
our
allies
imposed
growing
costs
on
russia
so
now
is
think
and
appropriate
time
for
all
of
us
to
step
back
and
take
hard
look
at
what
has
happened
violence
and
conflict
inevitably
lead
to
unforeseen
consequences
russia
these
separatists
and
ukraine
all
have
the
capacity
to
put
an
end
to
the
fighting
meanwhile
the
united
states
is
going
to
continue
to
lead
efforts
within
the
world
community
to
the
situation
to
stand
up
for
the
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
of
ukraine
and
to
support
the
people
of
ukraine
as
they
courageously
work
to
strengthen
their
democracy
and
make
their
own
decisions
about
how
they
should
move
forward
before
take
just
couple
of
questions
let
me
remark
on
one
other
issue
this
morning
spoke
with
prime
minister
of
israel
about
the
situation
in
we
discussed
military
operation
in
including
its
efforts
to
stop
the
threat
of
terrorist
infiltration
through
tunnels
into
israel
reaffirmed
my
strong
support
for
right
to
defend
itself
no
nation
should
accept
rockets
being
fired
into
its
borders
or
terrorists
into
its
territory
in
fact
while
was
having
the
conversation
with
prime
minister
sirens
went
off
in
also
made
clear
that
the
united
states
and
our
friends
and
allies
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
risks
of
further
escalation
and
the
loss
of
more
innocent
life
and
why
indicated
although
we
support
military
efforts
by
the
israelis
to
make
sure
that
rockets
are
not
being
fired
into
their
territory
we
also
have
said
that
our
understanding
is
the
current
military
ground
operations
are
designed
to
deal
with
the
tunnels
and
we
are
hopeful
that
israel
will
continue
to
approach
this
process
in
way
that
civilian
casualties
and
that
all
of
us
are
working
hard
to
return
to
the
that
was
reached
in
november
of
secretary
is
working
to
support
initiative
to
pursue
that
outcome
told
prime
minister
that
john
is
prepared
to
travel
to
the
region
following
additional
consultations
let
me
close
by
making
one
additional
comment
on
board
airlines
flight
there
were
apparently
nearly
researchers
and
advocates
to
an
international
conference
in
dedicated
to
combating
these
were
men
and
women
who
had
dedicated
their
own
lives
to
saving
the
lives
of
others
and
they
were
taken
from
us
in
senseless
act
of
violence
in
this
world
today
we
forget
that
in
the
midst
of
conflict
and
killing
there
are
people
like
these
people
who
are
focused
on
what
can
be
built
rather
than
what
can
be
destroyed
people
who
are
focused
on
how
they
can
help
people
that
never
met
people
who
define
themselves
not
by
what
makes
them
different
from
other
people
but
by
the
humanity
that
we
hold
in
common
important
for
us
to
lift
them
up
and
to
affirm
their
lives
and
time
for
us
to
heed
their
example
the
united
states
of
america
is
going
to
continue
to
stand
for
the
basic
principle
that
people
have
the
right
to
live
as
they
choose
that
nations
have
the
right
to
determine
their
own
destiny
and
that
when
terrible
events
like
this
occur
the
international
community
stands
on
the
side
of
justice
and
on
the
side
of
truth
so
with
that
let
me
take
just
couple
questions
start
with
you
question
thank
you
president
just
on
technical
matter
does
the
believe
that
this
passenger
jet
was
targeted
or
that
those
people
who
shot
it
down
may
have
been
going
after
military
thought
they
were
going
after
military
aircraft
and
more
broadly
this
incident
does
seem
to
escalate
the
crisis
in
ukraine
to
level
we
seen
before
does
that
change
your
calculus
in
terms
of
what
the
and
perhaps
europe
should
be
doing
in
terms
of
response
president
well
think
too
early
for
us
to
be
able
to
guess
what
the
intentions
of
those
who
might
have
launched
this
missile
might
have
had
the
investigation
is
going
to
be
ongoing
and
think
what
see
is
additional
information
surfacing
over
the
next
hours
hours
the
next
week
the
next
month
what
we
know
right
now
what
we
have
confidence
in
saying
right
now
is
that
missile
was
fired
and
that
what
brought
the
jet
down
we
know
or
we
have
confidence
in
saying
that
that
shot
was
taken
within
territory
that
is
controlled
by
the
russian
separatists
but
think
very
important
for
us
to
make
sure
that
we
do
get
out
ahead
of
the
facts
and
at
this
point
in
terms
of
identifying
specifically
what
individual
or
group
of
individuals
or
personnel
ordered
the
strike
how
it
came
about
those
are
things
that
think
are
still
going
to
be
subject
to
additional
information
that
going
to
be
gathering
and
working
with
the
entire
international
community
to
make
sure
that
the
focus
is
on
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing
and
being
truthful
and
my
concern
is
obviously
that
been
lot
of
misinformation
generated
in
eastern
ukraine
generally
this
should
snap
heads
to
attention
and
make
sure
that
we
do
have
time
for
propaganda
we
do
have
time
for
games
we
need
to
know
exactly
what
happened
and
everybody
needs
to
make
sure
that
holding
accountable
those
who
committed
this
outrage
with
respect
to
the
second
question
as
aware
before
this
terrible
incident
happened
we
had
already
up
sanctions
against
russia
and
think
the
concern
not
just
of
russian
officials
but
of
the
markets
about
the
impact
that
this
could
have
on
the
russian
economy
is
there
for
all
to
see
made
clear
to
president
that
our
preferred
path
is
to
resolve
this
diplomatically
but
that
means
that
he
and
the
russian
government
have
to
make
strategic
decision
are
they
going
to
continue
to
support
violent
separatists
whose
intent
is
to
undermine
the
government
of
ukraine
or
are
they
prepared
to
work
with
the
government
of
ukraine
to
arrive
at
and
peace
that
takes
into
account
the
interests
of
all
there
has
been
some
improved
language
at
times
over
the
last
month
coming
from
the
kremlin
and
coming
from
president
but
what
we
have
not
seen
is
an
actual
transition
and
different
actions
that
would
give
us
confidence
that
that
the
direction
that
they
want
to
take
and
we
will
continue
to
make
clear
that
as
russia
engages
in
efforts
that
are
supporting
the
separatists
that
we
have
the
capacity
to
increase
the
costs
that
we
impose
on
them
and
we
will
do
so
not
because
interested
in
hurting
russia
for
the
sake
of
hurting
russia
but
because
we
believe
in
standing
up
for
the
basic
principle
that
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
has
to
be
respected
and
it
is
not
the
united
states
or
russia
or
germany
or
any
other
country
that
should
be
deciding
what
happens
in
that
country
question
at
this
point
do
you
see
any
military
role
that
could
be
effective
president
we
do
see
military
role
beyond
what
already
been
doing
in
working
with
our
nato
partners
and
some
of
the
baltic
states
giving
them
reassurances
that
we
are
prepared
to
do
whatever
is
required
to
meet
our
alliance
obligations
holland
question
sir
thank
you
how
much
blame
for
this
do
you
put
on
president
and
will
you
use
this
incident
now
to
push
the
for
stronger
action
president
we
do
exactly
know
what
happened
yet
and
do
want
to
as
said
before
get
out
ahead
of
the
facts
but
what
do
know
is
is
that
we
have
seen
ticking
up
of
violence
in
eastern
ukraine
that
despite
the
efforts
of
the
government
to
abide
by
and
to
reach
out
and
agree
to
negotiations
including
with
the
separatists
that
has
been
rebuffed
by
these
separatists
we
know
that
they
are
heavily
armed
and
that
they
are
trained
and
we
know
that
not
an
accident
that
is
happening
because
of
russian
support
so
it
is
not
possible
for
these
separatists
to
function
the
way
functioning
to
have
the
equipment
that
they
have
set
aside
happened
with
respect
to
the
airlines
group
of
separatists
shoot
down
military
transport
planes
or
they
claim
shoot
down
fighter
jets
without
sophisticated
equipment
and
sophisticated
training
and
that
is
coming
from
russia
so
we
yet
know
exactly
what
happened
with
respect
to
the
airlines
although
obviously
beginning
to
draw
some
conclusions
given
the
nature
of
the
shot
that
was
fired
there
are
only
certain
types
of
missiles
that
can
reach
up
feet
and
shoot
down
passenger
jet
we
have
increasing
confidence
that
it
came
from
areas
controlled
by
the
separatists
but
without
having
definitive
judgment
on
those
issues
yet
what
we
do
know
is
is
that
the
violence
taking
place
there
is
facilitated
in
part
in
large
part
because
of
russian
support
and
they
have
the
ability
to
move
those
separatists
in
different
direction
if
makes
decision
that
we
are
not
going
to
allow
heavy
armaments
and
the
flow
of
fighters
into
ukraine
across
the
border
then
it
will
stop
and
if
it
stops
then
the
separatists
will
still
have
the
capacity
to
enter
into
negotiations
and
try
to
arrive
at
the
sort
of
political
accommodations
that
himself
says
he
wants
to
see
he
has
the
most
control
over
that
situation
and
so
far
at
least
he
has
not
exercised
it
question
tougher
sanctions
in
europe
will
you
push
for
them
president
well
think
that
this
certainly
will
be
call
for
europe
and
the
world
that
there
are
consequences
to
an
escalating
conflict
in
eastern
ukraine
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
it
is
not
going
to
be
contained
what
seen
here
is
just
in
one
country
alone
our
great
allies
the
dutch
or
more
of
their
citizens
being
killed
and
that
think
sadly
brings
home
the
degree
to
which
the
stakes
are
high
for
europe
not
simply
for
the
people
and
that
we
have
to
be
firm
in
our
resolve
in
making
sure
that
we
are
supporting
ukraine
in
its
efforts
to
bring
about
just
and
that
we
can
move
towards
political
solution
to
this
going
to
make
this
the
last
question
question
do
we
know
yet
if
there
were
other
americans
on
board
beyond
the
person
you
mentioned
and
how
do
you
prevent
stricter
restrictions
economic
sanctions
from
shocking
the
global
economy
and
president
we
have
been
pretty
methodical
over
the
last
hours
in
working
through
the
flight
manifest
and
identifying
which
passengers
might
have
had
passport
at
this
point
the
individual
that
mentioned
is
the
sole
person
that
we
can
definitively
say
was
or
dual
citizen
because
events
are
moving
so
quickly
want
to
say
with
absolute
certainty
that
there
might
not
be
additional
americans
but
at
this
stage
having
worked
through
the
list
been
in
contact
with
the
government
which
processed
the
passports
as
folks
were
boarding
this
is
our
best
assessment
of
the
number
of
americans
that
were
killed
obviously
that
does
nothing
to
lessen
our
outrage
about
all
those
families
regardless
of
nationality
it
is
heartbreaking
event
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
sanctions
on
the
economy
we
have
consistently
tried
to
tailor
these
sanctions
in
ways
that
would
have
an
impact
on
russia
on
their
economy
on
their
institutions
or
individuals
that
are
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
activities
that
are
taking
place
in
eastern
ukraine
while
the
impacts
on
not
only
the
economy
but
the
global
economy
it
is
relevant
consideration
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
world
economy
is
integrated
russia
is
large
economy
lot
of
financial
flows
between
russia
and
the
rest
of
the
world
but
we
feel
confident
that
at
this
point
the
sanctions
that
put
in
place
are
imposing
cost
on
russia
that
their
overall
impact
on
the
global
economy
is
minimal
it
is
something
that
we
have
to
obviously
pay
close
attention
to
but
think
treasury
in
consultation
with
our
european
partners
have
done
good
job
so
far
on
that
issue
thank
you
very
much
everybody
for
our
forces
in
the
battle
of
was
one
of
the
most
fierce
of
this
entire
war
americans
along
with
their
afghan
partners
were
manning
their
small
base
deep
in
valley
when
they
were
attacked
by
some
insurgents
and
those
insurgents
seemed
determined
to
overrun
an
even
smaller
post
just
outside
the
base
an
elevated
patch
of
boulders
and
sandbags
defended
by
just
nine
american
soldiers
soon
under
the
relentless
fire
all
nine
of
those
men
were
wounded
or
killed
insurgents
broke
through
the
wire
and
that
little
post
was
on
the
verge
of
falling
giving
the
enemy
perch
from
which
to
devastate
the
base
below
against
that
onslaught
one
american
held
the
line
just
years
old
nearly
surrounded
bloodied
but
unbowed
the
soldier
we
today
with
our
highest
military
decoration
the
medal
of
staff
sergeant
now
want
to
embarrass
but
the
character
he
displayed
that
day
was
clearly
forged
early
told
that
in
kindergarten
when
asked
what
he
wanted
to
be
when
he
grew
up
he
drew
picture
of
soldier
when
he
was
in
the
grade
his
teacher
sent
home
note
that
described
in
words
that
would
be
familiar
to
all
those
who
knew
him
today
she
wrote
is
very
special
human
being
in
you
see
the
humility
and
the
loyalty
that
define
men
and
women
in
uniform
of
this
medal
he
says
not
mine
alone
it
belongs
to
everybody
who
was
there
that
day
because
we
did
it
together
so
want
to
welcome
those
who
were
there
that
day
brothers
in
arms
and
those
who
are
going
to
be
welcoming
him
into
their
ranks
the
members
of
the
medal
of
society
we
are
very
proud
of
them
and
we
are
by
the
presence
of
the
families
of
our
fallen
as
well
we
welcome
family
many
from
new
including
his
wonderful
wife
have
to
take
pause
because
they
are
actually
celebrating
and
their
second
anniversary
today
as
put
it
going
to
be
tough
topping
this
one
as
anniversaries
go
but
let
me
just
give
you
piece
of
advice
as
somebody
who
now
has
been
married
for
over
years
you
should
try
just
saying
rest
on
your
laurels
after
just
two
years
we
welcome
their
gorgeous
son
who
is
beginning
to
teach
love
for
all
things
new
england
of
course
the
red
and
the
and
the
and
the
pats
want
you
to
try
and
imagine
the
extraordinary
circumstances
in
which
and
his
team
served
this
was
the
summer
of
and
this
was
time
when
our
forces
in
were
stretched
thin
and
our
troops
were
deployed
to
isolated
outposts
they
had
just
arrived
in
just
days
before
and
they
were
still
building
their
very
small
base
handful
of
vehicles
and
fighting
positions
and
foxholes
and
sandbags
one
report
later
concluded
had
significant
vulnerabilities
parts
of
the
village
sat
on
higher
ground
on
every
side
mountains
soared
feet
into
the
sky
heavy
equipment
to
help
build
their
defenses
was
delayed
in
the
heat
the
soldiers
ran
low
on
water
and
the
aerial
surveillance
they
were
counting
on
was
diverted
away
to
other
missions
early
that
morning
in
the
darkness
they
spotted
several
men
up
the
mountains
but
before
and
his
team
could
take
action
the
entire
valley
erupted
machine
gun
fire
and
mortar
and
grenades
poured
down
from
every
direction
and
those
insurgents
were
firing
from
ridges
and
from
the
village
and
from
trees
down
at
the
base
vehicle
exploded
scattering
its
missiles
back
at
our
soldiers
it
was
said
soldier
hell
on
earth
up
at
their
tiny
post
and
his
team
were
being
pounded
almost
instantly
every
one
of
them
was
wounded
was
hit
by
shrapnel
in
the
arm
and
both
legs
and
was
bleeding
badly
already
three
american
soldiers
in
that
valley
had
fallen
and
then
fourth
as
the
insurgents
moved
in
picked
up
grenade
pulled
the
pin
and
held
that
live
grenade
for
moment
then
another
then
another
finally
hurling
it
so
they
throw
it
back
and
he
did
that
again
and
he
did
it
again
unable
to
stand
pulled
himself
up
on
his
knees
and
manned
machine
gun
soldiers
from
the
base
below
made
daring
run
dodging
bullets
and
explosions
and
joined
the
but
now
the
enemy
was
inside
the
post
so
close
they
were
throwing
rocks
at
the
americans
so
close
they
came
right
up
to
the
sandbags
eight
american
soldiers
had
now
fallen
and
was
the
only
living
soldier
at
that
post
the
enemy
was
so
close
could
hear
their
voices
he
whispered
into
the
radio
he
was
the
only
one
left
and
was
running
out
of
ammo
was
going
to
die
he
remembers
and
made
my
peace
with
it
and
then
he
prepared
to
make
last
stand
bleeding
and
barely
conscious
threw
his
last
grenades
he
grabbed
grenade
launcher
and
fired
nearly
straight
up
so
the
grenade
came
back
down
on
the
enemy
just
yards
away
one
insurgent
was
now
right
on
top
of
the
post
shooting
down
until
another
team
of
americans
showed
up
and
drove
him
back
as
one
of
his
teammates
said
had
it
not
been
for
that
post
almost
certainly
would
have
been
overrun
even
with
reinforcements
the
battle
was
not
over
another
wave
of
grenades
slammed
into
the
post
nine
american
soldiers
were
now
gone
and
still
the
fighting
raged
worked
the
radio
helping
target
the
air
strikes
that
were
hitting
just
yards
away
and
with
those
strikes
the
tide
of
the
battle
began
to
turn
eventually
the
insurgents
fell
back
and
his
fellow
soldiers
had
held
their
ground
this
medal
says
is
an
opportunity
to
tell
our
story
there
was
everywhere
according
to
and
so
today
we
also
pay
tribute
to
all
who
served
with
such
that
day
shielding
their
wounded
buddies
with
their
own
bodies
picking
up
unexploded
missiles
with
their
hands
and
carrying
them
away
running
through
the
gunfire
to
reinforce
that
post
fighting
through
their
injuries
and
never
giving
up
helicopter
pilots
and
crews
who
came
in
under
heavy
fire
said
one
soldier
never
in
my
career
have
seen
such
bravery
and
sacrifice
and
so
would
ask
all
those
who
served
at
on
the
ground
and
in
the
air
to
please
stand
those
of
you
who
are
here
today
most
of
all
says
he
considers
this
medal
memorial
for
the
guys
who
come
home
so
today
we

american
soldiers

made
the
ultimate
sacrifice

serve
us
all
they
died
to
protect
each
of
us
and
their
legacy
lives
on
in
the
hearts
of
all
who
love
them
still
especially
their
families
mothers
fathers
wives
brothers
and
sisters
sons
and
daughters
to
you
their
families
know
no
words
can
match
the
depth
of
your
loss
but
please
know
that
this
nation
will
your
soldiers
now
and
forever
and
would
ask
the
gold
star
families
from
that
deployment
to
please
stand
including
age
and
who
this
week
turns
please
stand
this
is
the
story
wants
us
to
remember
soldiers
who
loved
each
other
like
brothers
and
who
fought
for
each
other
and
families
who
have
made
sacrifice
that
our
nation
must
never
forget
says
think
we
owe
it
to
them
to
live
lives
worthy
of
their
sacrifice
and
absolutely
right
as
believe
one
of
the
ways
we
can
do
that
is
by
heeding
the
lessons
of
when
this
nation
sends
our
troops
into
way
they
deserve
sound
strategy
and
mission
and
they
deserve
the
forces
and
support
to
get
the
job
done
and
that
what
we
owe
soldiers
like
and
all
the
comrades
that
were
lost
how
we
can
truly
all
those
who
gave
their
lives
that
day
how
as
nation
we
can
remain
worthy
of
their
sacrifice
know
that
view
that
shared
by
our
secretary
of
and
by
our
joint
chiefs
of
staff
and
all
the
leadership
here
hard
lessons
but
ones
that
are
deeply
engrained
in
our
hearts
it
is
remarkable
that
we
have
young
men
and
women
serving
in
our
military
who
day
in
day
out
are
able
to
perform
with
so
much
integrity
so
much
humility
and
so
much
courage
represents
the
very
best
of
that
tradition
and
we
are
very
very
proud
of
him
as
we
are
of
all
of
you
so
god
bless
you
god
bless
all
who
serve
in
our
name
may
god
continue
to
bless
the
united
states
of
america
and
with
that
would
like
our
military
aide
to
please
complete
the
ceremony
good
evening
today
two
operations
in
iraq
targeted
to
protect
our
american
personnel
and
humanitarian
effort
to
help
save
thousands
of
iraqi
civilians
who
are
trapped
on
mountain
without
food
and
water
and
facing
almost
certain
death
let
me
explain
the
actions
taking
and
why
first
said
in
june
as
the
terrorist
group
began
an
advance
across
iraq
that
the
united
states
would
be
prepared
to
take
targeted
military
action
in
iraq
if
and
when
we
determined
that
the
situation
required
it
in
recent
days
these
terrorists
have
continued
to
move
across
iraq
and
have
neared
the
city
of
where
american
diplomats
and
civilians
serve
at
our
consulate
and
american
military
personnel
advise
iraqi
forces
to
stop
the
advance
on
directed
our
military
to
take
targeted
strikes
against
terrorist
convoys
should
they
move
toward
the
city
we
intend
to
stay
vigilant
and
take
action
if
these
terrorist
forces
threaten
our
personnel
or
facilities
anywhere
in
iraq
including
our
consulate
in
and
our
embassy
in
baghdad
also
providing
urgent
assistance
to
iraqi
government
and
forces
so
they
can
more
effectively
wage
the
fight
against
second
at
the
request
of
the
iraqi
government
begun
operations
to
help
save
iraqi
civilians
stranded
on
the
as
has
marched
across
iraq
it
has
waged
ruthless
campaign
against
innocent
iraqis
and
these
terrorists
have
been
especially
barbaric
towards
religious
minorities
including
christian
and
small
and
ancient
religious
sect
countless
iraqis
have
been
displaced
and
chilling
reports
describe
militants
rounding
up
families
conducting
mass
executions
and
enslaving
women
in
recent
days
women
men
and
children
from
the
area
of
have
fled
for
their
lives
and
thousands
perhaps
tens
of
thousands
are
now
hiding
high
up
on
the
mountain
with
little
but
the
clothes
on
their
backs
without
food
without
water
people
are
starving
and
children
are
dying
of
thirst
meanwhile
forces
below
have
called
for
the
systematic
destruction
of
the
entire
people
which
would
constitute
genocide
so
these
innocent
families
are
faced
with
horrible
choice
descend
the
mountain
and
be
slaughtered
or
stay
and
slowly
die
of
thirst
and
hunger
said
before
the
united
states
can
not
and
should
not
intervene
every
time
crisis
in
the
world
so
let
me
be
clear
about
why
we
must
act
and
act
now
when
we
face
situation
like
we
do
on
that
mountain
with
innocent
people
facing
the
prospect
of
violence
on
horrific
scale
when
we
have
mandate
to
help
in
this
case
request
from
the
iraqi
government
and
when
we
have
the
unique
capabilities
to
help
avert
massacre
then
believe
the
united
states
of
america
can
not
turn
blind
eye
we
can
act
carefully
and
responsibly
to
prevent
potential
act
of
genocide
what
doing
on
that
mountain
therefore
targeted
if
necessary
to
help
forces
in
iraq
as
they
fight
to
break
the
siege
of
mount
and
protect
the
civilians
trapped
there
already
american
aircraft
have
begun
conducting
humanitarian
of
food
and
water
to
help
these
desperate
men
women
and
children
survive
earlier
this
week
one
iraqi
in
the
area
cried
to
the
world
there
is
no
one
coming
to
help
well
today
america
is
coming
to
help
also
consulting
with
other
countries
and
the
united
nations
who
have
called
for
action
to
address
this
humanitarian
crisis
know
that
many
of
you
are
rightly
concerned
about
any
american
military
action
in
iraq
even
limited
strikes
like
these
understand
that
ran
for
this
office
in
part
to
end
our
war
in
iraq
and
welcome
our
troops
home
and
what
done
as
will
not
allow
the
united
states
to
be
dragged
into
fighting
another
war
in
iraq
and
so
even
as
we
support
iraqis
as
they
take
the
fight
to
these
terrorists
american
combat
troops
will
not
be
returning
to
fight
in
iraq
because
no
american
military
solution
to
the
larger
crisis
in
iraq
the
only
lasting
solution
is
reconciliation
among
iraqi
communities
and
stronger
iraqi
security
forces
however
we
can
and
should
support
moderate
forces
who
can
bring
stability
to
iraq
so
even
as
we
carry
out
these
two
missions
we
will
continue
to
pursue
broader
strategy
that
empowers
iraqis
to
confront
this
crisis
iraqi
leaders
need
to
come
together
and
forge
new
government
that
represents
the
legitimate
interests
of
all
iraqis
and
that
can
fight
back
against
the
threats
like
iraqis
have
named
new
president
new
speaker
of
parliament
and
are
seeking
consensus
on
new
prime
minister
this
is
the
progress
that
needs
to
continue
in
order
to
reverse
the
momentum
of
the
terrorists
who
prey
on
divisions
once
iraq
has
new
government
the
united
states
will
work
with
it
and
other
countries
in
the
region
to
provide
increased
support
to
deal
with
this
humanitarian
crisis
and
challenge
none
of
have
an
interest
in
this
terrible
suffering
or
instability
and
so
continue
to
work
with
our
friends
and
allies
to
help
refugees
get
the
shelter
and
food
and
water
they
so
desperately
need
and
to
help
iraqis
push
back
against
the
several
hundred
american
that
ordered
to
iraq
will
continue
to
assess
what
more
we
can
do
to
help
train
advise
and
support
iraqi
forces
going
forward
and
just
as
consulted
congress
on
the
decisions
made
today
we
will
continue
to
do
so
going
forward
my
fellow
americans
the
world
is
confronted
by
many
challenges
and
while
america
has
never
been
able
to
right
every
wrong
america
has
made
the
world
more
secure
and
prosperous
place
and
our
leadership
is
necessary
to
underwrite
the
global
security
and
prosperity
that
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
will
depend
upon
we
do
so
by
adhering
to
set
of
core
principles
we
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
protect
our
people
we
support
our
allies
when
in
danger
we
lead
coalitions
of
countries
to
uphold
international
norms
and
we
strive
to
stay
true
to
the
fundamental
values
the
desire
to
live
with
basic
freedom
and
dignity
that
is
common
to
human
beings
wherever
they
are
why
people
all
over
the
world
look
to
the
united
states
of
america
to
lead
and
why
we
do
it
so
let
me
close
by
assuring
you
that
there
is
no
decision
that
take
more
seriously
than
the
use
of
military
force
over
the
last
several
years
we
have
brought
the
vast
majority
of
our
troops
home
from
iraq
and
and
been
careful
to
resist
calls
to
turn
time
and
again
to
our
military
because
america
has
other
tools
in
our
arsenal
than
our
military
we
can
also
lead
with
the
power
of
our
diplomacy
our
economy
and
our
ideals
but
when
the
lives
of
american
citizens
are
at
risk
we
will
take
action
my
responsibility
as
and
when
many
thousands
of
innocent
civilians
are
faced
with
the
danger
of
being
wiped
out
and
we
have
the
capacity
to
do
something
about
it
we
will
take
action
that
is
our
responsibility
as
americans
hallmark
of
american
leadership
who
we
are
so
tonight
we
give
thanks
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
especially
our
brave
pilots
and
crews
over
iraq
who
are
protecting
our
fellow
americans
and
saving
the
lives
of
so
many
men
women
and
children
that
they
will
never
meet
they
represent
american
leadership
at
its
best
as
nation
we
should
be
proud
of
them
and
of
our
enduring
commitment
to
uphold
our
own
security
and
the
dignity
of
our
fellow
human
beings
god
bless
our
armed
forces
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
morning
over
the
past
two
days
american
pilots
and
crews
have
served
with
courage
and
skill
in
the
skies
over
iraq
first
american
forces
have
conducted
targeted
against
terrorist
forces
outside
the
city
of
to
prevent
them
from
advancing
on
the
city
and
to
protect
our
american
diplomats
and
military
personnel
so
far
these
strikes
have
successfully
destroyed
arms
and
equipment
that
terrorists
could
have
used
against
meanwhile
forces
on
the
ground
continue
to
defend
the
city
and
the
united
states
and
the
iraqi
government
have
stepped
up
our
military
assistance
to
forces
as
they
wage
their
fight
second
our
humanitarian
effort
continues
to
help
the
men
women
and
children
stranded
on
mount
american
forces
have
so
far
conducted
two
successful
delivering
thousands
of
meals
and
gallons
of
water
to
these
desperate
men
women
and
children
and
american
aircraft
are
positioned
to
strike
terrorists
around
the
mountain
to
help
forces
in
iraq
break
the
siege
and
rescue
those
who
are
trapped
there
now
even
as
we
deal
with
these
immediate
situations
we
continue
to
pursue
broader
strategy
in
iraq
we
will
protect
our
american
citizens
in
iraq
whether
diplomats
civilians
or
military
if
these
terrorists
threaten
our
facilities
or
our
personnel
we
will
take
action
to
protect
our
people
we
will
continue
to
provide
military
assistance
and
advice
to
the
iraqi
government
and
forces
as
they
battle
these
terrorists
so
that
the
terrorists
can
not
establish
permanent
safe
haven
we
will
continue
to
work
with
the
international
community
to
deal
with
the
growing
humanitarian
crisis
in
iraq
even
as
our
attention
is
focused
on
preventing
an
act
of
genocide
and
helping
the
men
and
women
and
children
on
the
mountain
countless
iraqis
have
been
driven
or
fled
from
their
homes
including
many
this
morning
spoke
with
prime
minister
of
the
united
kingdom
and
president
of
france
pleased
that
both
leaders
expressed
their
strong
support
for
our
actions
and
have
agreed
to
join
us
in
providing
humanitarian
assistance
to
iraqi
civilians
who
are
suffering
so
much
once
again
america
is
proud
to
act
alongside
our
closest
friends
and
allies
more
broadly
the
united
nations
in
iraq
is
working
urgently
to
help
respond
to
the
needs
of
those
iraqis
fleeing
from
areas
under
threat
the
security
council
has
called
on
the
international
community
to
do
everything
it
can
to
provide
food
water
and
shelter
and
in
my
calls
with
allies
and
partners
around
the
world
continue
to
urge
them
to
join
us
in
this
humanitarian
effort
finally
we
continue
to
call
on
iraqis
to
come
together
and
form
the
inclusive
government
that
iraq
needs
right
now
vice
president
has
been
speaking
to
iraqi
leaders
and
our
team
in
baghdad
is
in
close
touch
with
the
iraqi
government
all
iraqi
communities
are
ultimately
threatened
by
these
barbaric
terrorists
and
all
iraqi
communities
need
to
unite
to
defend
their
country
just
as
we
are
focused
on
the
situation
in
the
north
affecting
and
iraqi
minorities
and
in
different
parts
of
iraq
have
suffered
mightily
at
the
hands
of
once
an
inclusive
government
is
in
place
confident
it
will
be
easier
to
all
iraqis
against
and
to
greater
support
from
our
friends
and
allies
ultimately
only
iraqis
can
ensure
the
security
and
stability
of
iraq
the
united
states
do
it
for
them
but
we
can
and
will
be
partners
in
that
effort
one
final
thing
as
we
go
forward
continue
to
consult
with
congress
and
coordinate
closely
with
our
allies
and
partners
and
as
americans
we
will
continue
to
show
gratitude
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
are
conducting
our
operations
there
when
called
they
were
ready
as
they
always
are
when
given
their
mission
performed
with
distinction
as
they
always
do
and
when
we
see
them
serving
with
such
and
compassion
defending
our
fellow
citizens
and
saving
the
lives
of
people
never
met
it
makes
us
proud
to
be
americans
as
we
always
will
be
so
with
that
let
me
take
couple
questions
president
for
how
long
period
of
time
do
you
see
these
continuing
for
and
is
your
goal
there
to
contain
isis
or
to
destroy
it
the
president
not
going
to
give
particular
timetable
because
as
said
from
the
start
wherever
and
whenever
personnel
and
facilities
are
threatened
my
obligation
my
responsibility
as
to
make
sure
that
they
are
protected
and
not
moving
our
embassy
soon
not
moving
our
consulate
soon
and
that
means
that
given
the
challenging
security
environment
going
to
maintain
vigilance
and
ensure
that
our
people
are
safe
our
initial
goal
is
to
not
only
make
sure
americans
are
protected
but
also
to
deal
with
this
humanitarian
situation
in
we
feel
confident
that
we
can
prevent
from
going
up
mountain
and
slaughtering
the
people
who
are
there
but
the
next
step
which
is
going
to
be
complicated
logistically
is
how
do
we
give
safe
passage
for
people
down
from
the
mountain
and
where
can
we
ultimately
relocate
them
so
that
they
are
safe
the
kind
of
coordination
that
we
need
to
do
internationally
was
very
pleased
to
get
the
cooperation
of
both
prime
minister
and
president
in
addressing
some
of
the
immediate
needs
in
terms
of
and
some
of
the
assets
and
logistical
support
that
providing
but
broader
set
of
questions
that
our
experts
now
are
engaged
in
with
the
united
nations
and
our
allies
and
partners
and
that
is
how
do
we
potentially
create
safe
corridor
or
some
other
mechanism
so
that
these
people
can
move
that
may
take
some
time
because
there
are
varying
estimates
of
how
many
people
are
up
there
but
in
the
thousands
and
moving
them
is
not
simple
in
this
kind
of
security
environment
just
to
give
people
sense
though
of
timetable
that
the
most
important
timetable
that
focused
on
right
now
is
the
iraqi
government
getting
formed
and
because
in
the
absence
of
an
iraqi
government
it
is
very
hard
to
get
unified
effort
by
iraqis
against
we
can
conduct
but
ultimately
not
going
to
be
an
american
military
solution
to
this
problem
going
to
have
to
be
an
iraqi
solution
that
america
and
other
countries
and
allies
support
and
that
happen
effectively
until
you
have
legitimate
iraqi
government
so
right
now
we
have
president
we
have
speaker
what
we
yet
have
is
prime
minister
and
cabinet
that
is
formed
that
can
go
ahead
and
move
forward
and
then
start
reaching
out
to
all
the
various
groups
and
factions
inside
of
iraq
and
can
give
confidence
to
populations
in
the
areas
that
is
not
the
only
game
in
town
it
also
then
allows
us
to
take
those
iraqi
security
forces
that
are
able
and
functional
and
they
understand
who
reporting
to
and
what
fighting
for
and
what
the
chain
of
command
is
and
it
provides
structure
in
which
better
cooperation
is
taking
place
between
the
region
and
baghdad
so
going
to
be
pushing
very
hard
to
encourage
iraqis
to
get
their
government
together
until
we
do
that
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
get
the
unity
of
effort
that
allows
us
to
not
just
play
but
also
engage
in
some
president
the
united
states
has
fought
long
wars
in
and
iraq
with
uncertain
outcomes
how
do
you
assure
the
american
people
that
not
getting
dragged
into
another
war
in
iraq
have
you
underestimated
the
power
of
isis
and
finally
you
said
that
you
involved
international
partners
in
humanitarian
efforts
is
there
any
thought
to
talking
to
international
partners
as
far
as
military
actions
to
prevent
the
spread
of
isis
the
president
well
couple
of
things
would
say
number
one
been
very
clear
that
not
going
to
have
combat
troops
in
iraq
again
and
we
are
going
to
maintain
that
because
we
should
have
learned
lesson
from
our
long
and
immensely
costly
incursion
in
iraq
and
that
is
that
our
military
is
so
effective
that
we
can
keep
lid
on
problems
wherever
we
are
if
we
put
enough
personnel
and
resources
into
it
but
it
can
only
last
if
the
people
in
these
countries
themselves
are
able
to
arrive
at
the
kinds
of
political
accommodations
and
compromise
that
any
society
requires
and
so
it
would
be
think
big
mistake
for
us
to
think
that
we
can
on
the
cheap
simply
go
in
tamp
everything
down
again
restart
without
some
fundamental
shift
in
attitudes
among
the
various
iraqi
factions
why
it
is
so
important
to
have
an
iraqi
government
on
the
ground
that
is
taking
responsibility
that
we
can
help
that
we
can
partner
with
that
has
the
capacity
to
get
alliances
in
the
region
and
once
in
place
then
think
we
end
up
being
one
of
many
countries
that
can
work
together
to
deal
with
the
broader
crisis
that
poses
what
were
your
other
questions
did
we
underestimate
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
their
advance
their
movement
over
the
last
several
months
has
been
more
rapid
than
the
intelligence
estimates
and
think
the
expectations
of
both
in
and
outside
of
iraq
and
part
of
that
is
think
not
full
appreciation
of
the
degree
to
which
the
iraqi
security
forces
when
far
away
from
baghdad
did
not
have
the
incentive
or
the
capacity
to
hold
ground
against
an
aggressive
adversary
and
so
one
more
reason
why
iraqi
government
formation
is
so
important
because
there
has
to
be
rebuilding
and
an
understanding
of
who
it
is
that
the
iraqi
security
forces
are
reporting
to
what
they
are
fighting
for
and
there
has
to
be
some
investment
by
in
pushing
back
against
think
already
seeing
and
we
will
see
even
further
the
degree
to
which
those
territories
under
control
alienated
populations
because
of
the
barbarity
and
brutality
with
which
they
operate
but
in
order
to
ensure
that
populations
reject
outright
these
kinds
of
incursions
got
to
feel
like
invested
in
broader
national
government
and
right
now
they
feel
that
so
the
upshot
is
that
what
seen
over
the
last
several
months
indicates
the
weaknesses
in
an
iraqi
government
but
what
also
seen
think
is
call
for
lot
of
iraqis
inside
of
baghdad
that
going
to
have
to
rethink
how
we
do
business
if
going
to
hold
our
country
together
and
hopefully
that
change
in
attitude
supplemented
by
improved
security
efforts
in
which
we
can
assist
and
help
that
can
make
difference
you
just
expressed
confidence
that
the
iraqi
government
can
eventually
prevent
safe
haven
but
also
just
described
the
complications
with
the
iraqi
government
and
the
sophistication
of
so
is
it
possible
that
what
described
and
your
ambitions
there
could
take
years
not
months
the
president
think
going
to
solve
this
problem
in
weeks
if
what
you
mean
think
this
is
going
to
take
some
time
the
iraqi
security
forces
in
order
to
mount
an
offensive
and
be
able
to
operate
effectively
with
the
support
of
populations
in
areas
are
going
to
have
to
revamp
get
have
clearer
strategy
all
going
to
be
dependent
on
government
that
the
iraqi
people
and
the
iraqi
military
have
confidence
in
we
can
help
in
all
those
efforts
think
part
of
what
able
to
do
right
now
is
to
preserve
space
for
them
to
do
the
hard
work
necessary
if
they
do
that
the
one
thing
that
also
think
has
changed
is
that
many
of
the
countries
in
the
region
who
have
been
generally
suspicious
or
wary
of
the
iraqi
government
are
more
likely
to
join
in
in
the
fight
against
isis
and
that
can
be
extremely
helpful
but
this
is
going
to
be
project
part
of
what
seen
is
that
minority
population
in
iraq
as
well
as
majority
population
in
syria
has
felt
dissatisfied
and
detached
and
alienated
from
their
respective
governments
and
that
has
been
ripe
territory
for
these
and
extremists
to
operate
and
rebuilding
governance
in
those
areas
and
legitimacy
for
stable
moderate
governing
in
those
areas
is
going
to
take
time
now
there
are
some
immediate
concerns
that
we
have
to
worry
about
we
have
to
make
sure
that
is
not
engaging
in
the
actions
that
could
cripple
country
permanently
key
infrastructure
inside
of
iraq
that
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
my
team
has
been
vigilant
even
before
went
into
about
foreign
fighters
and
gathering
in
syria
and
now
in
iraq
who
might
potentially
launch
attacks
outside
the
region
against
western
targets
and
targets
so
going
to
be
element
that
we
are
already
preparing
for
and
have
been
working
diligently
on
for
long
time
now
there
is
going
to
be
military
element
in
protecting
our
people
but
the
campaign
of
changing
that
environment
so
that
the
millions
of
who
live
in
these
areas
feel
connected
to
and
by
national
government
process
and
something
that
the
united
states
can
not
do
only
the
iraqi
people
themselves
can
do
we
can
help
we
can
advise
but
we
do
it
for
them
and
the
military
can
not
do
it
for
them
and
so
this
goes
back
to
the
earlier
question
about
military
involvement
the
nature
of
this
problem
is
not
one
that
military
can
solve
we
can
assist
and
our
military
obviously
can
play
an
extraordinarily
important
role
in
bolstering
efforts
of
an
iraqi
partner
as
they
make
the
right
steps
to
keep
their
country
together
but
we
do
it
for
them
last
question
america
has
spent
billion
dollars
in
iraq
do
you
anticipate
having
to
ask
congress
for
additional
funds
to
support
this
mission
the
president
currently
we
are
operating
within
the
budget
constraints
that
we
already
have
and
have
to
evaluate
what
happens
over
time
we
already
have
lot
of
assets
in
the
region
we
anticipate
when
we
make
our
preliminary
budgets
that
there
may
be
things
that
come
up
requiring
us
to
engage
and
right
now
at
least
think
we
are
okay
if
and
when
we
need
additional
dollars
to
make
sure
that
american
personnel
and
american
facilities
are
protected
then
we
will
certainly
make
that
request
but
right
now
not
our
primary
concern
last
question
president
do
you
have
any
second
thoughts
about
pulling
all
ground
troops
out
of
iraq
and
does
it
give
you
pause
as
the
is
it
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
president
what
just
find
interesting
is
the
degree
to
which
this
issue
keeps
on
coming
up
as
if
this
was
my
decision
under
the
previous
administration
we
had
turned
over
the
country
to
sovereign
democratically
elected
iraqi
government
in
order
for
us
to
maintain
troops
in
iraq
we
needed
the
invitation
of
the
iraqi
government
and
we
needed
assurances
that
our
personnel
would
be
immune
from
prosecution
if
for
example
they
were
protecting
themselves
and
ended
up
getting
in
firefight
with
iraqis
that
they
be
hauled
before
an
iraqi
judicial
system
and
the
iraqi
government
based
on
its
political
considerations
in
part
because
iraqis
were
tired
of
occupation
declined
to
provide
us
those
assurances
and
on
that
basis
we
left
we
had
offered
to
leave
additional
troops
so
when
you
hear
people
say
do
you
regret
president
not
leaving
more
troops
that
presupposes
that
would
have
overridden
this
sovereign
government
that
we
had
turned
the
keys
back
over
to
and
said
you
know
what
democratic
sovereign
except
if
decide
that
good
for
you
to
keep
or
or
marines
in
your
country
you
have
choice
which
would
have
kind
of
run
contrary
to
the
entire
argument
we
were
making
about
turning
over
the
country
back
to
iraqis
an
argument
not
just
made
by
me
but
made
by
the
previous
administration
so
just
be
clear
the
reason
that
we
did
not
have
force
in
iraq
was
because
the
iraqis
were
majority
of
iraqis
did
not
want
troops
there
and
politically
they
could
not
pass
the
kind
of
laws
that
would
be
required
to
protect
our
troops
in
iraq
having
said
all
that
if
in
fact
the
iraqi
government
behaved
the
way
it
did
over
the
last
five
six
years
where
it
failed
to
pass
legislation
that
would
and
give
them
sense
of
ownership
if
it
had
targeted
certain
leaders
and
jailed
them
if
it
had
alienated
some
of
the
tribes
that
we
had
brought
back
in
during
the
awakening
that
helped
us
turn
the
tide
in
if
they
had
done
all
those
things
and
we
had
had
troops
there
the
country
be
holding
together
either
the
only
difference
would
be
have
bunch
of
troops
on
the
ground
that
would
be
vulnerable
and
however
many
troops
we
had
we
would
have
to
now
be
reinforcing
have
to
be
protecting
them
and
have
much
bigger
job
and
probably
we
would
end
up
having
to
go
up
again
in
terms
of
the
number
of
grounds
troops
to
make
sure
that
those
forces
were
not
vulnerable
so
that
entire
analysis
is
bogus
and
is
wrong
but
it
gets
frequently
peddled
around
here
by
folks
who
are
trying
to
defend
previous
policies
that
they
themselves
made
going
forward
with
respect
to
we
are
leaving
the
force
there
think
the
lesson
for
is
not
the
fact
that
got
force
that
will
be
capable
of
training
and
supporting
afghan
security
efforts
think
the
real
lesson
in
is
that
if
factions
in
country
after
long
period
of
civil
war
do
not
find
way
to
come
up
with
political
accommodation
if
they
take
positions
and
their
attitude
is
want
percent
of
what
want
and
the
other
side
gets
nothing
then
the
hold
and
the
good
news
is
is
that
in
part
thanks
to
the
excellent
work
of
john
and
others
we
now
are
seeing
the
two
candidates
in
the
recent
presidential
election
start
coming
together
and
agreeing
not
only
to
move
forward
on
the
audit
to
be
able
to
finally
certify
winner
in
the
election
but
also
the
kinds
of
political
accommodations
that
are
going
to
be
required
to
keep
democracy
moving
so
real
lesson
think
for
coming
out
of
iraq
is
if
you
want
this
thing
to
work
then
whether
different
different
religions
different
regions
got
to
accommodate
each
other
otherwise
you
start
tipping
back
into
old
patterns
of
violence
and
it
matter
how
many
troops
are
there
if
that
happens
you
end
up
having
mess
thanks
lot
guys
good
afternoon
everybody
this
sound
system
is
really
powerful
today
like
to
update
the
american
people
on
two
issues
that
been
monitoring
closely
these
last
several
days
first
of
all
we
continue
to
make
progress
in
carrying
out
our
targeted
military
operations
in
iraq
last
week
two
limited
missions
protecting
our
people
and
facilities
inside
of
iraq
and
humanitarian
operation
to
help
save
thousands
of
iraqi
civilians
stranded
on
week
ago
we
assessed
that
many
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
had
abandoned
their
possessions
to
take
refuge
on
mount
in
desperate
attempt
to
avoid
slaughter
we
also
knew
that
terrorists
were
killing
and
enslaving
civilians
in
their
custody
and
laying
siege
to
the
mountain
without
food
or
water
they
faced
terrible
choice
starve
on
the
mountain
or
be
slaughtered
on
the
ground
when
america
came
to
help
over
the
last
week
the
military
conducted
humanitarian
air
drops
every
night
delivering
more
than
meals
and
gallons
of
fresh
water
we
were
joined
in
that
effort
by
the
united
kingdom
and
other
allies
pledged
support
our
military
was
able
to
successfully
strike
targets
around
the
mountain
which
improved
conditions
for
civilians
to
evacuate
the
mountain
safely
yesterday
small
team
of
americans
military
and
civilian
completed
their
review
of
the
conditions
on
the
mountain
they
found
that
food
and
water
have
been
reaching
those
in
need
and
that
thousands
of
people
have
been
evacuating
safely
each
and
every
night
the
civilians
who
remain
continue
to
leave
aided
by
forces
and
who
are
helping
to
facilitate
the
safe
passage
of
their
families
so
the
bottom
line
is
is
that
the
situation
on
the
mountain
has
greatly
improved
and
americans
should
be
very
proud
of
our
efforts
because
of
the
skill
and
professionalism
of
our
military
and
the
generosity
of
our
people
we
broke
the
siege
of
mount
we
helped
vulnerable
people
reach
safety
and
we
helped
save
many
innocent
lives
because
of
these
efforts
we
do
not
expect
there
to
be
an
additional
operation
to
evacuate
people
off
the
mountain
and
unlikely
that
going
to
need
to
continue
humanitarian
air
drops
on
the
mountain
the
majority
of
the
military
personnel
who
conducted
the
assessment
will
be
leaving
iraq
in
the
coming
days
and
just
want
to
say
that
as
could
not
be
prouder
of
the
men
and
women
of
our
military
who
carried
out
this
humanitarian
operation
almost
flawlessly
very
grateful
to
them
and
know
that
those
who
were
trapped
on
that
mountain
are
extraordinarily
grateful
as
well
now
the
situation
remains
dire
for
iraqis
subjected
to
terror
throughout
the
country
and
this
includes
minorities
like
and
iraqi
it
also
includes
and
going
to
be
working
with
our
international
partners
to
provide
humanitarian
assistance
to
those
who
are
suffering
in
northern
iraq
wherever
we
have
capabilities
and
we
can
carry
out
effective
missions
like
the
one
we
carried
out
on
mount
without
committing
combat
troops
on
the
ground
we
obviously
feel
great
urge
to
provide
some
humanitarian
relief
to
the
situation
and
been
very
encouraged
by
the
interest
of
our
international
partners
in
helping
on
these
kinds
of
efforts
as
well
we
will
continue
air
strikes
to
protect
our
people
and
facilities
in
iraq
we
have
increased
the
delivery
of
military
assistance
to
iraqi
and
forces
fighting
on
the
front
lines
and
perhaps
most
importantly
we
are
urging
iraqis
to
come
together
to
turn
the
tide
against
above
all
by
seizing
the
enormous
opportunity
of
forming
new
inclusive
government
under
the
leadership
of
prime
had
chance
to
speak
to
prime
few
days
ago
and
he
spoke
about
the
need
for
the
kind
of
inclusive
government
government
that
speaks
to
all
the
people
of
iraq
that
is
needed
right
now
he
still
has
challenging
task
in
putting
government
together
but
we
are
modestly
hopeful
that
the
iraqi
government
situation
is
moving
in
the
right
direction
now
second
want
to
address
something
been
in
the
news
over
the
last
couple
of
days
and
the
situation
in
missouri
know
that
many
americans
have
been
deeply
disturbed
by
the
images
seen
in
the
heartland
of
our
country
as
police
have
clashed
with
people
protesting
today
like
us
all
to
take
step
back
and
think
about
how
going
to
be
moving
forward
this
morning
received
thorough
update
on
the
situation
from
attorney
general
holder
who
has
been
following
it
and
been
in
communication
with
his
team
already
tasked
the
department
of
justice
and
the
to
independently
investigate
the
death
of
brown
along
with
local
officials
on
the
ground
the
department
of
justice
is
also
consulting
with
local
authorities
about
ways
that
they
can
maintain
public
safety
without
restricting
the
right
of
peaceful
protest
and
while
avoiding
unnecessary
escalation
made
clear
to
the
attorney
general
that
we
should
do
what
is
necessary
to
help
determine
exactly
what
happened
and
to
see
that
justice
is
done
also
just
spoke
with
governor
jay
nixon
of
missouri
expressed
my
concern
over
the
violent
turn
that
events
have
taken
on
the
ground
and
underscored
that
now
is
the
time
for
all
of
us
to
reflect
on
happened
and
to
find
way
to
come
together
going
forward
he
is
going
to
be
to
he
is
good
man
and
fine
governor
and
confident
that
working
together
he
is
going
to
be
able
to
communicate
his
desire
to
make
sure
that
justice
is
done
and
his
desire
to
make
sure
that
public
safety
is
maintained
in
an
appropriate
way
of
course
important
to
remember
how
this
started
we
lost
young
man
brown
in
heartbreaking
and
tragic
circumstances
he
was
years
old
his
family
will
never
hold
in
their
arms
again
and
when
something
like
this
happens
the
local
authorities
including
the
police
have
responsibility
to
be
open
and
transparent
about
how
they
are
investigating
that
death
and
how
they
are
protecting
the
people
in
their
communities
there
is
never
an
excuse
for
violence
against
police
or
for
those
who
would
use
this
tragedy
as
cover
for
vandalism
or
looting
also
no
excuse
for
police
to
use
excessive
force
against
peaceful
protests
or
to
throw
protestors
in
jail
for
lawfully
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
and
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
police
should
not
be
bullying
or
arresting
journalists
who
are
just
trying
to
do
their
jobs
and
report
to
the
american
people
on
what
they
see
on
the
ground
put
simply
we
all
need
to
hold
ourselves
to
high
standard
particularly
those
of
us
in
positions
of
authority
know
that
emotions
are
raw
right
now
in
and
there
are
certainly
passionate
differences
about
what
has
happened
there
are
going
to
be
different
accounts
of
how
this
tragedy
occurred
there
are
going
to
be
differences
in
terms
of
what
needs
to
happen
going
forward
part
of
our
democracy
but
remember
that
all
part
of
one
american
family
we
are
united
in
common
values
and
that
includes
belief
in
equality
under
the
law
basic
respect
for
public
order
and
the
right
to
peaceful
public
protest
reverence
for
the
dignity
of
every
single
man
woman
and
child
among
us
and
the
need
for
accountability
when
it
comes
to
our
government
so
now
is
the
time
for
healing
now
is
the
time
for
peace
and
calm
on
the
streets
of
now
is
the
time
for
an
open
and
transparent
process
to
see
that
justice
is
done
and
asked
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
on
the
scene
continue
to
work
with
local
officials
to
move
that
process
forward
they
will
be
reporting
to
me
in
the
coming
days
about
being
done
to
make
sure
that
happens
thanks
very
much
everybody
good
afternoon
everybody
want
to
say
few
words
on
number
of
topics
and
take
few
questions
before
the
long
day
weekend
first
beginning
with
the
number
one
thing
most
americans
care
about
the
economy
this
morning
we
found
out
that
our
economy
actually
grew
at
stronger
clip
in
the
quarter
than
we
originally
thought
companies
are
investing
consumers
are
spending
over
the
past
four
and
half
years
our
businesses
have
now
created
nearly
million
new
jobs
so
there
are
reasons
to
feel
good
about
the
direction
headed
but
as
everybody
knows
lot
more
that
we
should
be
doing
to
make
sure
that
all
americans
benefit
from
the
progress
that
made
and
going
to
be
pushing
congress
hard
on
this
when
they
return
next
week
second
in
iraq
our
dedicated
pilots
and
crews
continue
to
carry
out
the
targeted
strikes
that
to
protect
americans
there
and
to
address
the
humanitarian
situation
on
the
ground
as
will
always
do
what
is
necessary
to
protect
the
american
people
and
defend
against
evolving
threats
to
our
homeland
because
of
our
strikes
the
terrorists
of
are
losing
arms
and
equipment
in
some
areas
iraqi
government
and
forces
have
begun
to
push
them
back
and
we
continue
to
be
proud
and
grateful
to
our
extraordinary
personnel
serving
in
this
mission
now
poses
an
immediate
threat
to
the
people
of
iraq
and
to
people
throughout
the
region
and
why
our
military
action
in
iraq
has
to
be
part
of
broader
comprehensive
strategy
to
protect
our
people
and
to
support
our
partners
who
are
taking
the
fight
to
and
that
starts
with
leaders
building
on
the
progress
that
made
so
far
and
forming
an
inclusive
government
that
will
unite
their
country
and
strengthen
their
security
forces
to
confront
any
successful
strategy
though
also
needs
strong
regional
partners
encouraged
so
far
that
countries
in
the
region
countries
that
always
agree
on
many
things
increasingly
the
primacy
of
the
threat
that
poses
to
all
of
them
and
asked
secretary
to
travel
to
the
region
to
continue
to
build
the
coalition
needed
to
meet
this
threat
as
said
rooting
out
cancer
like
will
not
be
quick
or
easy
but
confident
that
we
can
and
we
will
working
closely
with
our
allies
and
our
partners
for
our
part
directed
secretary
and
our
joint
chiefs
of
staff
to
prepare
range
of
options
be
meeting
with
my
national
security
council
again
this
evening
as
we
continue
to
develop
that
strategy
and
been
consulting
with
members
of
congress
and
continue
to
do
so
in
the
days
ahead
finally
just
spoke
with
chancellor
of
germany
on
the
situation
in
ukraine
we
agree
if
there
was
ever
any
doubt
that
russia
is
responsible
for
the
violence
in
eastern
ukraine
the
violence
is
encouraged
by
russia
the
separatists
are
trained
by
russia
they
are
armed
by
russia
they
are
funded
by
russia
russia
has
deliberately
and
repeatedly
violated
the
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
of
ukraine
and
the
new
images
of
russian
forces
inside
ukraine
make
that
plain
for
the
world
to
see
this
comes
as
forces
are
making
progress
against
the
separatists
as
result
of
the
actions
russia
has
already
taken
and
the
major
sanctions
imposed
with
our
european
and
international
partners
russia
is
already
more
isolated
than
at
any
time
since
the
end
of
the
cold
war
capital
is
fleeing
investors
are
increasingly
staying
out
its
economy
is
in
decline
and
this
ongoing
russian
incursion
into
ukraine
will
only
bring
more
costs
and
consequences
for
russia
next
week
be
in
europe
to
coordinate
with
our
closest
allies
and
partners
in
estonia
will
reaffirm
our
unwavering
commitment
to
the
of
our
nato
allies
at
the
nato
summit
in
the
united
kingdom
focus
on
the
additional
steps
we
can
take
to
ensure
the
alliance
remains
prepared
for
any
challenge
our
meeting
of
the
commission
will
be
another
opportunity
for
our
alliance
to
continue
our
partnership
with
ukraine
and
look
forward
to
reaffirming
the
unwavering
commitment
of
the
united
states
to
ukraine
and
its
people
when
welcome
president
to
the
white
house
next
month
so
with
that
going
to
take
few
questions
and
going
to
start
with
somebody
who
guess
is
now
big
cheese
moved
on
but
understand
this
is
going
to
be
his
last
chance
to
ask
me
question
in
the
press
room
so
want
to
congratulate
chuck
and
give
him
first
glad
you
said
the
press
let
me
start
with
syria
the
decision
that
you
have
to
make
between
first
of
all
is
it
or
situation
about
going
after
in
syria
can
you
defeat
or
isis
without
going
after
them
in
syria
and
then
how
do
you
you
have
said
that
has
lost
legitimacy
to
lead
defeating
isis
could
help
keep
power
talk
about
how
you
those
two
pieces
of
your
foreign
policy
president
well
first
of
all
want
to
make
sure
everybody
is
clear
on
what
doing
now
because
it
is
limited
our
focus
right
now
is
to
protect
american
personnel
on
the
ground
in
iraq
to
protect
our
embassy
to
protect
our
consulates
to
make
sure
that
critical
infrastructure
that
could
adversely
affect
our
personnel
is
protected
where
we
see
an
opportunity
that
allows
us
with
very
modest
risk
to
help
the
humanitarian
situation
there
as
we
did
in
mountain
we
will
take
those
opportunities
after
having
consulted
with
congress
but
our
core
priority
right
now
is
just
to
make
sure
that
our
folks
are
safe
and
to
do
an
effective
assessment
of
iraqi
and
capabilities
as
said
think
in
the
last
press
conference
in
order
for
us
to
be
successful
got
to
have
an
iraqi
government
that
is
unified
and
inclusive
so
we
are
continuing
to
push
them
to
get
that
job
done
as
soon
as
we
have
an
iraqi
government
in
place
the
likelihood
of
the
iraqi
security
forces
being
more
effective
in
taking
the
fight
to
significantly
increases
and
the
options
that
asking
for
from
the
joint
chiefs
focuses
primarily
on
making
sure
that
is
not
overrunning
iraq
what
is
true
though
is
that
the
violence
been
taking
place
in
syria
has
obviously
given
safe
haven
there
in
ungoverned
spaces
and
in
order
for
us
to
degrade
over
the
long
term
going
to
have
to
build
regional
strategy
now
not
going
to
do
that
alone
going
to
have
to
do
that
with
other
partners
and
particularly
partners
because
part
of
the
goal
here
is
to
make
sure
that
both
in
syria
and
in
iraq
feel
as
if
got
an
investment
in
government
that
actually
functions
government
that
can
protect
them
government
that
makes
sure
that
their
families
are
safe
from
the
barbaric
acts
that
seen
in
and
right
now
those
structures
are
not
in
place
and
why
the
issue
with
respect
to
syria
is
not
simply
military
issue
also
political
issue
also
an
issue
that
involves
all
the
states
in
the
region
and
leadership
that
this
cancer
that
has
developed
is
one
that
they
have
to
be
just
as
invested
in
defeating
as
we
are
and
so
to
cut
to
the
chase
in
terms
of
what
may
be
your
specific
concerns
chuck
my
priority
at
this
point
is
to
make
sure
that
the
gains
that
made
in
iraq
are
rolled
back
and
that
iraq
has
the
opportunity
to
govern
itself
effectively
and
secure
itself
but
when
we
look
at
broader
strategy
that
is
consistent
with
what
said
at
west
point
consistent
with
what
said
at
the
national
college
clearly
has
come
to
represent
the
very
worst
elements
in
the
region
that
we
have
to
deal
with
collectively
and
going
to
be
project
going
to
require
us
to
syria
in
some
fashion
and
syria
in
some
fashion
means
that
got
to
get
moderate
who
are
able
to
govern
and
offer
real
alternative
and
competition
to
what
has
been
doing
in
some
of
these
spaces
now
the
last
point
with
respect
to
not
just
my
opinion
think
it
would
be
international
opinion
that
has
lost
legitimacy
in
terms
of
dropping
barrel
bombs
on
innocent
families
and
killing
tens
of
thousands
of
people
and
right
now
what
seeing
is
the
areas
that
is
occupying
are
not
controlled
by
anyway
and
frankly
seem
to
have
the
capability
or
reach
to
get
into
those
areas
so
think
this
is
situation
where
we
have
to
choose
between
or
the
kinds
of
people
who
carry
on
the
incredible
violence
that
been
seeing
there
we
will
continue
to
support
moderate
opposition
inside
of
syria
in
part
because
we
have
to
give
people
inside
of
syria
choice
other
than
or
and
see
any
scenario
in
which
somehow
is
able
to
bring
peace
and
stability
to
region
that
is
majority
and
has
not
so
far
shown
any
willingness
to
share
power
with
them
or
in
any
kind
of
significant
way
deal
with
the
longstanding
grievances
that
they
have
there
do
you
need
approval
to
go
into
syria
president
have
consulted
with
congress
throughout
this
process
am
confident
that
as
have
the
authorities
to
engage
in
the
acts
that
we
are
conducting
currently
as
our
strategy
develops
we
will
continue
to
consult
with
congress
and
do
think
that
it
will
be
important
for
congress
to
weigh
in
or
that
our
consultations
with
congress
continue
to
develop
so
that
the
american
people
are
part
of
the
debate
but
want
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
we
have
strategy
yet
think
what
seen
in
some
of
the
news
reports
suggests
that
folks
are
getting
little
further
ahead
of
where
at
than
we
currently
are
and
think
not
just
my
assessment
but
the
assessment
of
our
military
as
well
we
need
to
make
sure
that
got
clear
plans
that
developing
them
at
that
point
will
consult
with
congress
and
make
sure
that
their
voices
are
heard
but
no
point
in
me
asking
for
action
on
the
part
of
congress
before
know
exactly
what
it
is
that
is
going
to
be
required
for
us
to
get
the
job
done
thank
you
president
do
you
consider
escalation
in
ukraine
an
invasion
and
when
you
talk
about
additional
costs
to
russia
are
you
ready
at
this
point
to
impose
broader
economic
sanctions
or
are
you
considering
other
responses
that
go
beyond
sanctions
president
consider
the
actions
that
seen
in
the
last
week
continuation
of
been
taking
place
for
months
now
as
said
in
my
opening
statement
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
not
indigenous
uprising
in
eastern
ukraine
the
separatists
are
backed
trained
armed
financed
by
russia
throughout
this
process
seen
deep
russian
involvement
in
everything
that
done
think
in
part
because
of
the
progress
that
you
had
seen
by
the
around
and
russia
determined
that
it
had
to
be
little
more
overt
in
what
it
had
already
been
doing
but
not
really
shift
what
we
have
seen
though
is
that
president
and
russia
have
repeatedly
passed
by
potential
to
resolve
this
diplomatically
and
so
in
our
consultations
with
our
european
allies
and
partners
my
expectation
is
is
that
we
will
take
additional
steps
primarily
because
we
have
not
seen
any
meaningful
action
on
the
part
of
russia
to
actually
try
to
resolve
this
in
diplomatic
fashion
and
think
that
the
sanctions
that
already
applied
have
been
effective
our
intelligence
shows
that
the
know
been
effective
even
though
it
may
not
appear
on
russian
television
and
think
there
are
ways
for
us
to
deepen
or
expand
the
scope
of
some
of
that
work
but
ultimately
think
important
to
is
the
degree
to
which
russian
is
isolating
russia
they
doing
this
to
themselves
and
what
been
encouraged
by
is
the
degree
to
which
our
european
partners
even
though
they
are
bearing
cost
in
implementing
these
sanctions
they
understand
that
broader
principle
is
at
stake
and
so
look
forward
to
the
consultations
that
have
when
see
them
next
week
miller
thank
you
president
last
year
you
said
that
you
believe
our
democracy
is
stronger
when
the
president
acts
with
the
support
of
congress
in
response
to
question
you
said
you
have
strategy
yet
but
reconsider
that
going
forward
but
why
you
go
to
congress
before
this
current
round
of
strikes
in
iraq
do
you
not
believe
that
the
case
anymore
what
you
said
last
year
and
throughout
your
career
also
said
that
you
raised
concerns
with
the
expansion
of
powers
of
the
executive
are
you
concerned
that
your
recent
actions
unilaterally
had
maybe
have
cut
against
that
president
no
and
why
it
is
not
just
part
of
my
responsibility
but
it
is
sacred
duty
for
me
as
to
protect
the
american
people
and
that
requires
me
to
act
fast
based
on
information
receive
if
an
embassy
of
ours
or
consulate
of
ours
is
being
threatened
the
decisions
made
were
based
on
very
concrete
assessments
about
the
possibility
that
might
be
overrun
in
the
region
and
that
our
consulate
could
be
in
danger
and
afford
to
wait
in
order
to
make
sure
that
those
folks
are
protected
but
throughout
this
process
consulted
closely
with
congress
and
the
feedback
gotten
from
congress
is
is
that
doing
the
right
thing
now
as
we
go
forward
as
described
to
chuck
and
look
at
broader
regional
strategy
with
an
international
coalition
and
partners
to
systematically
degrade
capacity
to
engage
in
the
terrible
violence
and
disruptions
that
been
engaging
in
not
just
in
syria
not
just
in
iraq
but
potentially
elsewhere
if
we
nip
this
at
the
bud
then
those
consultations
with
congress
for
something
that
is
longer
term
think
become
more
relevant
and
it
is
my
intention
that
congress
has
to
have
some
as
representatives
of
the
american
people
and
by
the
way
the
american
people
need
to
hear
what
that
strategy
is
but
as
said
to
chuck
want
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
in
some
of
the
media
reports
the
suggestion
seems
to
have
been
that
about
to
go
full
scale
on
an
elaborate
strategy
for
defeating
and
the
suggestion
guess
has
been
that
start
moving
forward
imminently
and
somehow
congress
still
out
of
town
is
going
to
be
left
in
the
dark
not
going
to
happen
we
are
going
to
continue
to
focus
on
protecting
the
american
people
going
to
continue
where
we
can
to
engage
in
the
sort
of
humanitarian
acts
that
saved
so
many
folks
who
were
trapped
on
mountain
we
are
going
to
work
politically
and
diplomatically
with
folks
in
the
region
and
going
to
cobble
together
the
kind
of
coalition
that
we
need
for
strategy
as
soon
as
we
are
able
to
fit
together
the
military
political
and
economic
components
of
that
strategy
there
will
be
military
aspect
to
that
and
going
to
be
important
for
congress
to
know
what
that
is
in
part
because
it
may
cost
some
money
just
take
couple
more
yes
thank
you
president
do
you
regret
not
moving
on
isis
earlier
there
are
some
reports
indicating
that
most
of
the
weapons
the
weapons
that
they
have
they
got
it
or
they
acquired
it
after
the
fall
of
and
also
the
iraqi
president
said
today
that
the
iraqi
forces
are
in
no
position
to
stand
up
to
isis
what
makes
you
think
that
forming
new
government
will
change
the
situation
president
well
once
got
into
that
posed
big
problem
because
no
doubt
that
they
were
able
to
capture
some
weapons
and
resources
that
they
then
used
to
finance
additional
operations
and
at
that
stage
we
immediately
contacted
the
iraqi
government
keep
in
mind
we
had
been
in
communications
with
the
iraqi
government
for
more
than
year
indicating
that
we
saw
significant
problems
in
the
areas
prime
minister
was
not
as
responsive
perhaps
as
we
would
have
liked
to
some
of
the
underlying
political
grievances
that
existed
at
the
time
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
order
for
iraq
security
forces
to
be
successful
they
going
to
need
help
they
going
to
need
help
from
us
they
going
to
need
help
from
our
international
partners
they
going
to
need
additional
training
they
going
to
need
additional
equipment
and
we
are
going
to
be
prepared
to
offer
that
support
there
may
be
role
for
an
international
coalition
providing
additional
air
support
for
their
operations
but
the
reason
so
important
that
an
iraqi
government
be
in
place
is
this
is
not
simply
military
problem
the
problem
we
have
had
consistently
is
population
that
feels
alienated
from
baghdad
and
does
not
feel
invested
in
happening
and
does
not
feel
as
if
anybody
is
looking
out
for
them
if
we
can
get
government
in
place
that
provides
some
hope
that
national
government
serves
their
interest
if
they
can
regain
some
confidence
and
trust
that
it
will
follow
through
on
commitments
that
were
made
way
back
in
and
and
and
earlier
about
how
you
arrive
at
for
example
laws
and
give
people
opportunities
so
they
not
locked
out
of
government
positions
if
those
things
are
followed
through
on
and
we
are
able
to
combine
it
with
sound
military
strategy
then
think
we
can
be
successful
if
we
then
the
idea
that
the
united
states
or
any
outside
power
would
perpetually
defeat
isis
think
is
unrealistic
as
said
before
think
said
in
the
previous
press
conference
our
military
is
the
best
in
the
world
we
can
route
isis
on
the
ground
and
keep
lid
on
things
temporarily
but
then
as
soon
as
we
leave
the
same
problems
come
back
again
so
got
to
make
sure
that
iraqis
understand
in
the
end
they
going
to
be
responsible
for
their
own
security
and
part
of
that
is
going
to
be
the
capacity
for
them
to
make
compromises
it
also
means
that
states
in
the
region
stop
being
ambivalent
about
these
extremist
groups
the
truth
is
that
had
state
actors
who
at
times
have
thought
that
the
way
to
advance
their
interests
is
well
financing
some
of
these
groups
as
proxies
is
not
such
bad
strategy
and
part
of
our
message
to
the
entire
region
is
this
should
be
call
to
to
to
everybody
that
group
like
isis
is
beyond
the
pale
that
they
have
no
vision
or
ideology
beyond
violence
and
chaos
and
the
slaughter
of
innocent
people
and
as
consequence
got
to
all
join
together
even
if
we
have
differences
on
range
of
political
issues
to
make
sure
that
rooted
out
last
question
president
despite
all
of
the
actions
the
west
has
taken
to
get
russia
to
pull
back
from
ukraine
russia
seems
intent
on
taking
one
step
after
another
convoys
transports
of
arms
at
what
point
do
sanctions
no
longer
work
would
you
envisage
the
possibility
of
necessity
of
military
action
to
get
russia
to
pull
back
from
ukraine
president
we
are
not
taking
military
action
to
solve
the
problem
what
doing
is
to
the
international
community
to
apply
pressure
on
russia
but
think
it
is
very
important
to
that
military
solution
to
this
problem
is
not
going
to
be
forthcoming
now
the
fact
that
russia
has
taken
these
actions
in
violation
of
the
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
of
the
has
resulted
believe
in
weakening
of
russia
not
strengthening
of
russia
that
may
not
be
apparent
immediately
but
think
it
will
become
increasingly
apparent
what
also
done
is
isolated
russia
from
its
trading
partners
its
commercial
partners
international
business
in
ways
that
think
are
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
recover
from
and
we
will
continue
to
stand
firm
with
our
allies
and
partners
that
what
is
happening
is
wrong
that
there
is
solution
that
allows
ukraine
and
russia
to
live
peacefully
but
it
is
not
in
the
cards
for
us
to
see
military
confrontation
between
russia
and
the
united
states
in
this
region
keep
in
mind
however
that
about
to
go
to
nato
conference
ukraine
is
not
member
of
nato
but
number
of
those
states
that
are
close
by
are
and
we
take
our
article
commitments
to
defend
each
other
very
seriously
and
that
includes
the
smallest
nato
member
as
well
as
the
largest
nato
member
and
so
part
of
the
reason
think
this
nato
meeting
is
going
to
be
so
important
is
to
refocus
attention
on
the
critical
function
that
nato
plays
to
make
sure
that
every
country
is
contributing
in
order
to
deliver
on
the
promise
of
our
article
assurances
part
of
the
reason
be
going
to
estonia
is
to
let
the
know
that
we
mean
what
we
say
with
respect
to
our
treaty
obligations
we
have
those
treaty
obligations
with
ukraine
we
do
however
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
them
and
doing
not
just
lot
of
work
diplomatically
but
also
financially
in
order
to
make
sure
that
they
have
the
best
chance
at
dealing
with
what
is
admittedly
very
difficult
situation
thank
you
very
much
everybody
on
immigration
president
thank
you
guys
thank
you
immigration
president
how
are
external
events
and
your
executive
going
to
impact
your
decision
on
immigration
reform
some
people
say
going
to
delay
this
the
president
let
me
just
say
this
been
very
clear
about
the
fact
that
our
immigration
system
is
broken
and
needs
to
be
fixed
and
my
preference
continues
to
be
that
congress
act
think
anybody
thinks
that
congress
is
going
to
act
in
the
short
term
but
hope
springs
eternal
that
after
the
elections
they
may
act
in
the
meantime
what
asked
to
do
is
to
look
at
what
kinds
of
executive
authorities
we
have
in
order
to
make
the
system
work
better
and
had
lot
of
stakeholder
discussions
that
set
of
proposals
is
being
worked
up
and
the
one
thing
that
think
has
happened
was
the
issue
with
unaccompanied
children
that
got
so
much
attention
couple
of
months
back
and
part
of
the
reason
that
was
important
was
not
because
that
represented
huge
unprecedented
surge
in
overall
immigration
at
the
border
but
do
think
that
it
changed
the
perception
of
the
american
people
about
happening
at
the
borders
and
so
one
of
the
things
had
have
had
to
do
is
to
work
through
systematically
to
make
sure
that
that
specific
problem
in
fairly
defined
area
of
the
border
that
starting
to
deal
with
that
in
serious
way
and
the
good
news
is
started
to
make
some
progress
mean
what
seen
so
far
is
that
throughout
the
summer
the
number
of
apprehensions
have
been
decreasing
maybe
counterintuitive
but
good
thing
because
that
means
that
fewer
folks
are
coming
across
the
number
of
apprehensions
in
august
are
down
from
july
and
actually
lower
than
they
were
august
of
last
year
apprehensions
in
july
were
half
of
what
they
were
in
june
so
seeing
significant
downward
trend
in
terms
of
these
unaccompanied
children
and
what
that
think
allows
us
to
do
is
to
make
sure
that
those
kids
are
being
taken
care
of
properly
with
due
process
at
the
same
time
allowed
us
to
then
engage
in
broader
conversation
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
get
more
resources
down
at
the
border
it
would
have
been
helped
along
if
congress
had
voted
for
the
supplemental
that
asked
for
they
did
not
that
means
got
to
make
some
administrative
choices
and
executive
choices
about
for
example
getting
more
immigration
judges
down
there
so
that
has
kept
us
busy
but
it
has
not
stopped
the
process
of
looking
more
broadly
about
how
do
we
get
smarter
immigration
system
in
place
while
waiting
for
congress
to
act
and
it
continues
to
be
my
belief
that
if
see
congressional
action
that
need
to
do
at
least
what
can
in
order
to
make
the
system
work
better
but
some
of
these
things
do
affect
and
just
going
to
be
working
through
as
systematically
as
possible
in
order
to
get
this
done
but
have
no
doubt
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action
going
to
do
what
can
to
make
sure
the
system
works
better
thank
you
guys
my
fellow
americans
tonight
want
to
speak
to
you
about
what
the
united
states
will
do
with
our
friends
and
allies
to
degrade
and
ultimately
destroy
the
terrorist
group
known
as
as
my
highest
priority
is
the
security
of
the
american
people
over
the
last
several
years
we
have
consistently
taken
the
fight
to
terrorists
who
threaten
our
country
we
took
out
bin
laden
and
much
of
leadership
in
and
pakistan
we
targeted
affiliate
in
yemen
and
recently
eliminated
the
top
commander
of
its
affiliate
in
somalia
we
done
so
while
bringing
more
than
american
troops
home
from
iraq
and
drawing
down
our
forces
in
where
our
combat
mission
will
end
later
this
year
thanks
to
our
military
and
professionals
america
is
safer
still
we
continue
to
face
terrorist
threat
we
erase
every
trace
of
evil
from
the
world
and
small
groups
of
killers
have
the
capacity
to
do
great
harm
that
was
the
case
before
and
that
remains
true
today
and
that
why
we
must
remain
vigilant
as
threats
emerge
at
this
moment
the
greatest
threats
come
from
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
where
radical
groups
exploit
grievances
for
their
own
gain
and
one
of
those
groups
is
which
calls
itself
the
islamic
state
now
let
make
two
things
clear
is
not
islamic
no
religion
condones
the
killing
of
innocents
and
the
vast
majority
of
victims
have
been
muslim
and
is
certainly
not
state
it
was
formerly
affiliate
in
iraq
and
has
taken
advantage
of
sectarian
strife
and
syria
civil
war
to
gain
territory
on
both
sides
of
the
border
it
is
by
no
government
nor
by
the
people
it
is
terrorist
pure
and
simple
and
it
has
no
vision
other
than
the
slaughter
of
all
who
stand
in
its
way
in
region
that
has
known
so
much
bloodshed
these
terrorists
are
unique
in
their
brutality
they
execute
captured
prisoners
they
kill
children
they
enslave
rape
and
force
women
into
marriage
they
threatened
religious
minority
with
genocide
and
in
acts
of
barbarism
they
took
the
lives
of
two
american
journalists
and
so
poses
threat
to
the
people
of
iraq
and
syria
and
the
broader
middle
east
including
american
citizens
personnel
and
facilities
if
left
unchecked
these
terrorists
could
pose
growing
threat
beyond
that
region
including
to
the
united
states
while
we
have
not
yet
detected
specific
plotting
against
our
homeland
leaders
have
threatened
america
and
our
allies
our
intelligence
community
believes
that
thousands
of
foreigners
including
and
some
americans
have
joined
them
in
syria
and
iraq
trained
and
these
fighters
could
try
to
return
to
their
home
countries
and
carry
out
deadly
attacks
know
many
americans
are
concerned
about
these
threats
tonight
want
you
to
know
that
the
united
states
of
america
is
meeting
them
with
strength
and
resolve
last
month
ordered
our
military
to
take
targeted
action
against
to
stop
its
advances
since
then
we
conducted
more
than
successful
in
iraq
these
strikes
have
protected
american
personnel
and
facilities
killed
fighters
destroyed
weapons
and
given
space
for
iraqi
and
forces
to
reclaim
key
territory
these
strikes
have
also
helped
save
the
lives
of
thousands
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
but
this
is
not
our
fight
alone
american
power
can
make
decisive
difference
but
we
can
not
do
for
iraqis
what
they
must
do
for
themselves
nor
can
we
take
the
place
of
arab
partners
in
securing
their
region
and
that
why
insisted
that
additional
action
depended
upon
iraqis
forming
an
inclusive
government
which
they
have
now
done
in
recent
days
so
tonight
with
new
iraqi
government
in
place
and
following
consultations
with
allies
abroad
and
congress
at
home
can
announce
that
america
will
lead
broad
coalition
to
roll
back
this
terrorist
threat
our
objective
is
clear
we
will
degrade
and
ultimately
destroy
through
comprehensive
and
sustained
strategy
first
we
will
conduct
systematic
campaign
of
against
these
terrorists
working
with
the
iraqi
government
we
will
expand
our
efforts
beyond
protecting
our
own
people
and
humanitarian
missions
so
that
we
hitting
targets
as
iraqi
forces
go
on
moreover
have
made
it
clear
that
we
will
hunt
down
terrorists
who
threaten
our
country
wherever
they
are
that
means
will
not
hesitate
to
take
action
against
in
syria
as
well
as
iraq
this
is
core
principle
of
my
presidency
if
you
threaten
america
you
will
find
no
safe
haven
second
we
will
increase
our
support
to
forces
fighting
these
terrorists
on
the
ground
in
june
deployed
several
hundred
american
to
iraq
to
assess
how
we
can
best
support
iraqi
security
forces
now
that
those
teams
have
completed
their
work
and
iraq
has
formed
government
we
will
send
an
additional
to
iraq
as
have
said
before
these
american
forces
will
not
have
combat
mission
we
will
not
get
dragged
into
another
ground
war
in
iraq
but
they
are
needed
to
support
iraqi
and
forces
with
training
intelligence
and
equipment
we
also
support
iraq
efforts
to
stand
up
national
guard
units
to
help
communities
secure
their
own
freedom
from
control
across
the
border
in
syria
we
have
ramped
up
our
military
assistance
to
the
syrian
opposition
tonight
call
on
congress
again
to
give
us
additional
authorities
and
resources
to
train
and
equip
these
fighters
in
the
fight
against
we
can
not
rely
on
an
regime
that
its
own
people
regime
that
will
never
regain
the
legitimacy
it
has
lost
instead
we
must
strengthen
the
opposition
as
the
best
to
extremists
like
while
pursuing
the
political
solution
necessary
to
solve
syria
crisis
once
and
for
all
third
we
will
continue
to
draw
on
our
substantial
capabilities
to
prevent
attacks
working
with
our
partners
we
will
redouble
our
efforts
to
cut
off
its
funding
improve
our
intelligence
strengthen
our
defenses
counter
its
warped
ideology
and
stem
the
flow
of
foreign
fighters
into
and
out
of
the
middle
east
and
in
two
weeks
will
chair
meeting
of
the
security
council
to
further
the
international
community
around
this
effort
fourth
we
will
continue
to
provide
humanitarian
assistance
to
innocent
civilians
who
have
been
displaced
by
this
terrorist
this
includes
and
muslims
who
are
at
grave
risk
as
well
as
tens
of
thousands
of
and
other
religious
minorities
we
can
not
allow
these
communities
to
be
driven
from
their
ancient
homelands
so
this
is
our
strategy
and
in
each
of
these
four
parts
of
our
strategy
america
will
be
joined
by
broad
coalition
of
partners
already
allies
are
flying
planes
with
us
over
iraq
sending
arms
and
assistance
to
iraqi
security
forces
and
the
syrian
opposition
sharing
intelligence
and
providing
billions
of
dollars
in
humanitarian
aid
secretary
was
in
iraq
today
meeting
with
the
new
government
and
supporting
their
efforts
to
promote
unity
and
in
the
coming
days
he
will
travel
across
the
middle
east
and
europe
to
enlist
more
partners
in
this
fight
especially
arab
nations
who
can
help
communities
in
iraq
and
syria
to
drive
these
terrorists
from
their
lands
this
is
american
leadership
at
its
best
we
stand
with
people
who
fight
for
their
own
freedom
and
we
rally
other
nations
on
behalf
of
our
common
security
and
common
humanity
my
administration
has
also
secured
bipartisan
support
for
this
approach
here
at
home
have
the
authority
to
address
the
threat
from
but
believe
we
are
strongest
as
nation
when
the
president
and
congress
work
together
so
welcome
congressional
support
for
this
effort
in
order
to
show
the
world
that
americans
are
united
in
confronting
this
danger
now
it
will
take
time
to
eradicate
cancer
like
and
any
time
we
take
military
action
there
are
risks
involved
especially
to
the
servicemen
and
women
who
carry
out
these
missions
but
want
the
american
people
to
understand
how
this
effort
will
be
different
from
the
wars
in
iraq
and
it
will
not
involve
american
combat
troops
fighting
on
foreign
soil
this
campaign
will
be
waged
through
steady
relentless
effort
to
take
out
wherever
they
exist
using
our
air
power
and
our
support
for
partner
forces
on
the
ground
this
strategy
of
taking
out
terrorists
who
threaten
us
while
supporting
partners
on
the
front
lines
is
one
that
we
have
successfully
pursued
in
yemen
and
somalia
for
years
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
approach
outlined
earlier
this
year
to
use
force
against
anyone
who
threatens
america
core
interests
but
to
partners
wherever
possible
to
address
broader
challenges
to
international
order
my
fellow
americans
we
live
in
time
of
great
change
tomorrow
marks
years
since
our
country
was
attacked
next
week
marks
six
years
since
our
economy
suffered
its
worst
setback
since
the
great
depression
yet
despite
these
shocks
through
the
pain
we
have
felt
and
the
grueling
work
required
to
bounce
back
america
is
better
positioned
today
to
seize
the
future
than
any
other
nation
on
earth
our
technology
companies
and
universities
are
unmatched
our
manufacturing
and
auto
industries
are
thriving
energy
independence
is
closer
than
it
been
in
decades
for
all
the
work
that
remains
our
businesses
are
in
the
longest
uninterrupted
stretch
of
job
creation
in
our
history
despite
all
the
divisions
and
discord
within
our
democracy
see
the
grit
and
determination
and
common
goodness
of
the
american
people
every
single
day
and
that
makes
me
more
confident
than
ever
about
our
country
future
abroad
american
leadership
is
the
one
constant
in
an
uncertain
world
it
is
america
that
has
the
capacity
and
the
will
to
the
world
against
terrorists
it
is
america
that
has
rallied
the
world
against
russian
aggression
and
in
support
of
the
peoples
right
to
determine
their
own
destiny
it
is
america
our
scientists
our
doctors
our
that
can
help
contain
and
cure
the
outbreak
of
it
is
america
that
helped
remove
and
destroy
syria
declared
chemical
weapons
so
that
they
pose
threat
to
the
syrian
people
or
the
world
again
and
it
is
america
that
is
helping
muslim
communities
around
the
world
not
just
in
the
fight
against
terrorism
but
in
the
fight
for
opportunity
and
tolerance
and
more
hopeful
future
america
our
endless
blessings
bestow
an
enduring
burden
but
as
americans
we
welcome
our
responsibility
to
lead
from
europe
to
asia
from
the
far
reaches
of
africa
to
capitals
of
the
middle
east
we
stand
for
freedom
for
justice
for
dignity
these
are
values
that
have
guided
our
nation
since
its
founding
tonight
ask
for
your
support
in
carrying
that
leadership
forward
do
so
as
who
could
not
be
prouder
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
pilots
who
bravely
fly
in
the
face
of
danger
above
the
middle
east
and
who
support
our
partners
on
the
ground
when
we
helped
prevent
the
massacre
of
civilians
trapped
on
distant
mountain
here
what
one
of
them
said
we
owe
our
american
friends
our
lives
our
children
will
always
remember
that
there
was
someone
who
felt
our
struggle
and
made
long
journey
to
protect
innocent
people
that
is
the
difference
we
make
in
the
world
and
our
own
safety
our
own
security
depends
upon
our
willingness
to
do
what
it
takes
to
defend
this
nation
and
uphold
the
values
that
we
stand
for
timeless
ideals
that
will
endure
long
after
those
who
offer
only
hate
and
destruction
have
been
vanquished
from
the
earth
may
god
bless
our
troops
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
president
secretary
general
fellow
delegates
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
come
together
at
crossroads
between
war
and
peace
between
disorder
and
integration
between
fear
and
hope
around
the
globe
there
are
signposts
of
progress
the
shadow
of
world
war
that
existed
at
the
founding
of
this
institution
has
been
lifted
and
the
prospect
of
war
between
major
powers
reduced
the
ranks
of
member
states
has
more
than
tripled
and
more
people
live
under
governments
they
elected
hundreds
of
millions
of
human
beings
have
been
freed
from
the
prison
of
poverty
with
the
proportion
of
those
living
in
extreme
poverty
cut
in
half
and
the
world
economy
continues
to
strengthen
after
the
worst
financial
crisis
of
our
lives
today
whether
you
live
in
or
in
my
village
more
than
miles
from
nairobi
you
can
hold
in
your
hand
more
information
than
the
greatest
libraries
together
learned
how
to
cure
disease
and
harness
the
power
of
the
wind
and
the
sun
the
very
existence
of
this
institution
is
unique
achievement
the
people
of
the
world
committing
to
resolve
their
differences
peacefully
and
to
solve
their
problems
together
often
tell
young
people
in
the
united
states
that
despite
the
headlines
this
is
the
best
time
in
human
history
to
be
born
for
you
are
more
likely
than
ever
before
to
be
literate
to
be
healthy
to
be
free
to
pursue
your
dreams
and
yet
there
is
pervasive
unease
in
our
world
sense
that
the
very
forces
that
have
brought
us
together
have
created
new
dangers
and
made
it
difficult
for
any
single
nation
to
insulate
itself
from
global
forces
as
we
gather
here
an
outbreak
of
overwhelms
public
health
systems
in
west
africa
and
threatens
to
move
rapidly
across
borders
russian
aggression
in
europe
recalls
the
days
when
large
nations
trampled
small
ones
in
pursuit
of
territorial
ambition
the
brutality
of
terrorists
in
syria
and
iraq
forces
us
to
look
into
the
heart
of
darkness
each
of
these
problems
demands
urgent
attention
but
they
are
also
symptoms
of
broader
problem
the
failure
of
our
international
system
to
keep
pace
with
an
interconnected
world
we
collectively
have
not
invested
adequately
in
the
public
health
capacity
of
developing
countries
too
often
we
have
failed
to
enforce
international
norms
when
inconvenient
to
do
so
and
we
have
not
confronted
forcefully
enough
the
intolerance
sectarianism
and
hopelessness
that
feeds
violent
extremism
in
too
many
parts
of
the
globe
fellow
delegates
we
come
together
as
united
nations
with
choice
to
make
we
can
renew
the
international
system
that
has
enabled
so
much
progress
or
we
can
allow
ourselves
to
be
pulled
back
by
an
of
instability
we
can
reaffirm
our
collective
responsibility
to
confront
global
problems
or
be
swamped
by
more
and
more
outbreaks
of
instability
and
for
america
the
choice
is
clear
we
choose
hope
over
fear
we
see
the
future
not
as
something
out
of
our
control
but
as
something
we
can
shape
for
the
better
through
concerted
and
collective
effort
we
reject
fatalism
or
cynicism
when
it
comes
to
human
affairs
we
choose
to
work
for
the
world
as
it
should
be
as
our
children
deserve
it
to
be
there
is
much
that
must
be
done
to
meet
the
test
of
this
moment
but
today
like
to
focus
on
two
defining
questions
at
the
root
of
so
many
of
our
challenges
whether
the
nations
here
today
will
be
able
to
renew
the
purpose
of
the
founding
and
whether
we
will
come
together
to
reject
the
cancer
of
violent
extremism
first
all
of
us
big
nations
and
small
must
meet
our
responsibility
to
observe
and
enforce
international
norms
we
are
here
because
others
that
we
gain
more
from
cooperation
than
conquest
one
hundred
years
ago
world
war
claimed
the
lives
of
many
millions
proving
that
with
the
terrible
power
of
modern
weaponry
the
cause
of
empire
ultimately
leads
to
the
graveyard
it
would
take
another
world
war
to
roll
back
the
forces
of
fascism
the
notions
of
racial
supremacy
and
form
this
united
nations
to
ensure
that
no
nation
can
subjugate
its
and
claim
their
territory
recently
actions
in
ukraine
challenge
this
order
here
are
the
facts
after
the
people
of
ukraine
popular
protests
and
calls
for
reform
their
corrupt
president
fled
against
the
will
of
the
government
in
crimea
was
annexed
russia
poured
arms
into
eastern
ukraine
violent
separatists
and
conflict
that
has
killed
thousands
when
civilian
airliner
was
shot
down
from
areas
that
these
proxies
controlled
they
refused
to
allow
access
to
the
crash
for
days
when
ukraine
started
to
reassert
control
over
its
territory
russia
gave
up
the
of
merely
supporting
the
separatists
and
moved
troops
across
the
border
this
is
vision
of
the
world
in
which
might
makes
right
world
in
which
one
borders
can
be
redrawn
by
another
and
people
are
not
allowed
to
recover
the
remains
of
their
loved
ones
because
of
the
truth
that
might
be
revealed
america
stands
for
something
different
we
believe
that
right
makes
might
that
bigger
nations
should
not
be
able
to
bully
smaller
ones
and
that
people
should
be
able
to
choose
their
own
future
and
these
are
simple
truths
but
they
must
be
defended
america
and
our
allies
will
support
the
people
of
ukraine
as
they
develop
their
democracy
and
economy
we
will
reinforce
our
nato
allies
and
uphold
our
commitment
to
collective
we
will
impose
cost
on
russia
for
aggression
and
we
will
counter
falsehoods
with
the
truth
and
we
call
upon
others
to
join
us
on
the
right
side
of
history
for
while
small
gains
can
be
won
at
the
barrel
of
gun
they
will
ultimately
be
turned
back
if
enough
voices
support
the
freedom
of
nations
and
peoples
to
make
their
own
decisions
moreover
different
path
is
available
the
path
of
diplomacy
and
peace
and
the
ideals
this
institution
is
designed
to
uphold
the
recent
agreement
in
ukraine
offers
an
opening
to
achieve
those
objectives
if
russia
takes
that
path
path
that
for
stretches
of
the
war
period
resulted
in
prosperity
for
the
russian
people
then
we
will
lift
our
sanctions
and
welcome
role
in
addressing
common
challenges
after
all
what
the
united
states
and
russia
have
been
able
to
do
in
past
years
from
reducing
our
nuclear
stockpiles
to
meeting
our
obligations
under
the
nuclear
treaty
to
cooperating
to
remove
and
destroy
declared
chemical
weapons
and
the
kind
of
cooperation
we
are
prepared
to
pursue
again
if
russia
changes
course
this
speaks
to
central
question
of
our
global
age
whether
we
will
solve
our
problems
together
in
spirit
of
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
or
whether
we
descend
into
the
destructive
rivalries
of
the
past
when
nations
find
common
ground
not
simply
based
on
power
but
on
principle
then
we
can
make
enormous
progress
and
stand
before
you
today
committed
to
investing
american
strength
to
working
with
all
nations
to
address
the
problems
we
face
in
the
century
as
we
speak
america
is
deploying
our
doctors
and
scientists
supported
by
our
military
to
help
contain
the
outbreak
of
and
pursue
new
treatments
but
we
need
broader
effort
to
stop
disease
that
could
kill
hundreds
of
thousands
inflict
horrific
suffering
economies
and
move
rapidly
across
borders
easy
to
see
this
as
distant
problem
until
it
is
not
and
that
is
why
we
will
continue
to
other
countries
to
join
us
in
making
concrete
commitments
significant
commitments
to
fight
this
outbreak
and
enhance
our
system
of
global
health
security
for
the
long
term
america
is
pursuing
diplomatic
resolution
to
the
iranian
nuclear
issue
as
part
of
our
commitment
to
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
pursue
the
peace
and
security
of
world
without
them
and
this
can
only
take
place
if
iran
seizes
this
historic
opportunity
my
message
to
leaders
and
people
has
been
simple
and
consistent
do
not
let
this
opportunity
pass
we
can
reach
solution
that
meets
your
energy
needs
while
assuring
the
world
that
your
program
is
peaceful
america
is
and
will
continue
to
be
pacific
power
promoting
peace
stability
and
the
free
flow
of
commerce
among
nations
but
we
will
insist
that
all
nations
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
road
and
resolve
their
territorial
disputes
peacefully
consistent
with
international
law
how
the
has
grown
and
the
only
way
to
protect
this
progress
going
forward
america
is
committed
to
development
agenda
that
extreme
poverty
by
we
will
do
our
part
to
help
people
feed
themselves
power
their
economies
and
care
for
their
sick
if
the
world
acts
together
we
can
make
sure
that
all
of
our
children
enjoy
lives
of
opportunity
and
dignity
america
is
pursuing
ambitious
reductions
in
our
carbon
emissions
and
increased
our
investments
in
clean
energy
we
will
do
our
part
and
help
developing
nations
do
theirs
but
the
science
tells
us
we
can
only
succeed
in
combating
climate
change
if
we
are
joined
in
this
effort
by
every
other
nation
by
every
major
power
how
we
can
protect
this
planet
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
in
other
words
on
issue
after
issue
we
can
not
rely
on
rule
book
written
for
different
century
if
we
lift
our
eyes
beyond
our
borders
if
we
think
globally
and
if
we
act
cooperatively
we
can
shape
the
course
of
this
century
as
our
predecessors
shaped
the
war
age
but
as
we
look
to
the
future
one
issue
risks
cycle
of
conflict
that
could
derail
so
much
progress
and
that
is
the
cancer
of
violent
extremism
that
has
ravaged
so
many
parts
of
the
muslim
world
of
course
terrorism
is
not
new
speaking
before
this
assembly
president
kennedy
put
it
well
is
not
new
weapon
he
said
history
it
has
been
used
by
those
who
could
not
prevail
either
by
persuasion
or
in
the
century
terror
was
used
by
all
manner
of
groups
who
failed
to
come
to
power
through
public
support
but
in
this
century
we
have
faced
more
lethal
and
ideological
brand
of
terrorists
who
have
perverted
one
of
the
great
religions
with
access
to
technology
that
allows
small
groups
to
do
great
harm
they
have
embraced
nightmarish
vision
that
would
divide
the
world
into
adherents
and
infidels
killing
as
many
innocent
civilians
as
possible
employing
the
most
brutal
methods
to
intimidate
people
within
their
communities
have
made
it
clear
that
america
will
not
base
our
entire
foreign
policy
on
reacting
to
terrorism
instead
waged
focused
campaign
against
and
its
associated
forces
taking
out
their
leaders
denying
them
the
safe
havens
they
rely
on
at
the
same
time
we
have
reaffirmed
again
and
again
that
the
united
states
is
not
and
never
will
be
at
war
with
islam
islam
teaches
peace
muslims
the
world
over
aspire
to
live
with
dignity
and
sense
of
justice
and
when
it
comes
to
america
and
islam
there
is
no
us
and
them
there
is
only
us
because
millions
of
muslim
americans
are
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
country
so
we
reject
any
suggestion
of
clash
of
belief
in
permanent
religious
war
is
the
misguided
refuge
of
extremists
who
can
not
build
or
create
anything
and
therefore
peddle
only
fanaticism
and
hate
and
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
future
depends
on
us
uniting
against
those
who
would
divide
us
along
the
fault
lines
of
tribe
or
sect
race
or
religion
but
this
is
not
simply
matter
of
words
collectively
we
must
take
concrete
steps
to
address
the
danger
posed
by
religiously
motivated
fanatics
and
the
trends
that
fuel
their
recruitment
moreover
this
campaign
against
extremism
goes
beyond
narrow
security
challenge
for
while
degraded
methodically
core
and
supported
transition
to
sovereign
afghan
government
extremist
ideology
has
shifted
to
other
places
particularly
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
where
quarter
of
young
people
have
no
job
where
food
and
water
could
grow
scarce
where
corruption
is
rampant
and
sectarian
conflicts
have
become
increasingly
hard
to
contain
as
an
international
community
we
must
meet
this
challenge
with
focus
on
four
areas
first
the
terrorist
group
known
as
must
be
degraded
and
ultimately
destroyed
this
group
has
all
who
they
come
across
in
iraq
and
syria
mothers
sisters
daughters
have
been
subjected
to
rape
as
weapon
of
war
innocent
children
have
been
gunned
down
bodies
have
been
dumped
in
mass
graves
religious
minorities
have
been
starved
to
death
in
the
most
horrific
crimes
imaginable
innocent
human
beings
have
been
beheaded
with
videos
of
the
atrocity
distributed
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
world
no
god
condones
this
terror
no
grievance
justifies
these
actions
there
can
be
no
reasoning
no
negotiation
with
this
brand
of
evil
the
only
language
understood
by
killers
like
this
is
the
language
of
force
so
the
united
states
of
america
will
work
with
broad
coalition
to
dismantle
this
network
of
death
in
this
effort
we
do
not
act
alone
nor
do
we
intend
to
send
troops
to
occupy
foreign
lands
instead
we
will
support
iraqis
and
fighting
to
reclaim
their
communities
we
will
use
our
military
might
in
campaign
of
to
roll
back
we
will
train
and
equip
forces
fighting
against
these
terrorists
on
the
ground
we
will
work
to
cut
off
their
financing
and
to
stop
the
flow
of
fighters
into
and
out
of
the
region
and
already
over
nations
have
offered
to
join
this
coalition
today
ask
the
world
to
join
in
this
effort
those
who
have
joined
should
leave
the
battlefield
while
they
can
those
who
continue
to
fight
for
hateful
cause
will
find
they
are
increasingly
alone
for
we
will
not
succumb
to
threats
and
we
will
demonstrate
that
the
future
belongs
to
those
who
build
not
those
who
destroy
so
that
an
immediate
challenge
the
first
challenge
that
we
must
meet
the
second
it
is
time
for
the
world
especially
muslim
communities
to
explicitly
forcefully
and
consistently
reject
the
ideology
of
like
and
it
is
one
of
the
tasks
of
all
great
religions
to
accommodate
devout
faith
with
modern
multicultural
world
no
children
are
born
hating
and
no
children
anywhere
should
be
educated
to
hate
other
people
there
should
be
no
more
tolerance
of
clerics
who
call
upon
people
to
harm
innocents
because
jewish
or
because
they
christian
or
because
they
muslim
it
is
time
for
new
compact
among
the
peoples
of
this
world
to
eradicate
war
at
its
most
fundamental
source
and
that
is
the
corruption
of
young
minds
by
violent
ideology
that
means
cutting
off
the
funding
that
fuels
this
hate
time
to
end
the
hypocrisy
of
those
who
accumulate
wealth
through
the
global
economy
and
then
siphon
funds
to
those
who
teach
children
to
tear
it
down
that
means
contesting
the
space
that
terrorists
occupy
including
the
internet
and
social
media
their
propaganda
has
coerced
young
people
to
travel
abroad
to
fight
their
wars
and
turned
students
young
people
full
of
potential
into
suicide
bombers
we
must
offer
an
alternative
vision
that
means
bringing
people
of
different
faiths
together
all
religions
have
been
attacked
by
extremists
from
within
at
some
point
and
all
people
of
faith
have
responsibility
to
lift
up
the
value
at
the
heart
of
all
great
religions
do
unto
thy
as
you
would
do
you
would
have
done
unto
yourself
the
ideology
of
or
or
will
wilt
and
die
if
it
is
consistently
exposed
and
confronted
and
refuted
in
the
light
of
day
look
at
the
new
forum
for
promoting
peace
in
muslim
societies
sheikh
bin
described
its
purpose
must
declare
war
on
war
so
the
outcome
will
be
peace
upon
look
at
the
young
british
muslims
who
responded
to
terrorist
propaganda
by
starting
the
campaign
declaring
is
hiding
behind
false
look
at
the
christian
and
muslim
leaders
who
came
together
in
the
central
african
republic
to
reject
violence
listen
to
the
imam
who
said
try
to
divide
the
religious
in
our
country
but
religion
be
cause
of
hate
war
or
later
today
the
security
council
will
adopt
resolution
that
the
responsibility
of
states
to
counter
violent
extremism
but
resolutions
must
be
followed
by
tangible
commitments
so
accountable
when
we
fall
short
next
year
we
should
all
be
prepared
to
announce
the
concrete
steps
that
we
have
taken
to
counter
extremist
ideologies
in
our
own
countries
by
getting
intolerance
out
of
schools
stopping
before
it
spreads
and
promoting
institutions
and
programs
that
build
new
bridges
of
understanding
third
we
must
address
the
cycle
of
conflict
especially
sectarian
conflict
that
creates
the
conditions
that
terrorists
prey
upon
there
is
nothing
new
about
wars
within
religions
endured
centuries
of
vicious
sectarian
conflict
today
it
is
violence
within
muslim
communities
that
has
become
the
source
of
so
much
human
misery
it
is
time
to
acknowledge
the
destruction
wrought
by
proxy
wars
and
terror
campaigns
between
and
across
the
middle
east
and
it
is
time
that
political
civic
and
religious
leaders
reject
sectarian
strife
so
be
clear
this
is
fight
that
no
one
is
winning
brutal
civil
war
in
syria
has
already
killed
nearly
people
displaced
millions
iraq
has
come
perilously
close
to
plunging
back
into
the
abyss
the
conflict
has
created
fertile
recruiting
ground
for
terrorists
who
inevitably
export
this
violence
the
good
news
is
we
also
see
signs
that
this
tide
could
be
reversed
we
have
new
inclusive
government
in
baghdad
new
iraqi
prime
minister
welcomed
by
his
factions
rejecting
those
who
try
to
provoke
war
and
these
steps
must
be
followed
by
broader
truce
nowhere
is
this
more
necessary
than
syria
together
with
our
partners
america
is
training
and
equipping
the
syrian
opposition
to
be
to
the
terrorists
of
and
the
brutality
of
the
regime
but
the
only
lasting
solution
to
civil
war
is
political
an
inclusive
political
transition
that
responds
to
the
legitimate
aspirations
of
all
syrian
citizens
regardless
of
ethnicity
regardless
of
creed
cynics
may
argue
that
such
an
outcome
can
never
come
to
pass
but
there
is
no
other
way
for
this
madness
to
end
whether
one
year
from
now
or
ten
and
it
points
to
the
fact
that
time
for
broader
negotiation
in
the
region
in
which
major
powers
address
their
differences
directly
honestly
and
peacefully
across
the
table
from
one
another
rather
than
through
proxies
can
promise
you
america
will
remain
engaged
in
the
region
and
we
are
prepared
to
engage
in
that
effort
my
fourth
and
final
point
is
simple
one
the
countries
of
the
arab
and
muslim
world
must
focus
on
the
extraordinary
potential
of
their
people
especially
the
youth
and
here
like
to
speak
directly
to
young
people
across
the
muslim
world
you
come
from
great
tradition
that
stands
for
education
not
ignorance
innovation
not
destruction
the
dignity
of
life
not
murder
those
who
call
you
away
from
this
path
are
betraying
this
tradition
not
defending
it
you
have
demonstrated
that
when
young
people
have
the
tools
to
succeed
good
schools
education
in
math
and
science
an
economy
that
nurtures
creativity
and
entrepreneurship
then
societies
will
flourish
so
america
will
partner
with
those
that
promote
that
vision
where
women
are
full
participants
in
politics
or
economy
societies
are
more
likely
to
succeed
and
why
we
support
the
participation
of
women
in
parliaments
and
peace
processes
schools
and
the
economy
if
young
people
live
in
places
where
the
only
option
is
between
the
dictates
of
state
or
the
lure
of
an
extremist
underground
then
no
strategy
can
succeed
but
where
genuine
civil
society
is
allowed
to
flourish
where
people
can
express
their
views
and
peacefully
for
better
life
then
you
dramatically
expand
the
alternatives
to
terror
and
such
positive
change
need
not
come
at
the
expense
of
tradition
and
faith
we
see
this
in
iraq
where
young
man
started
library
for
his
peers
link
heritage
to
their
hearts
he
said
and
them
reason
to
we
see
it
in
tunisia
where
secular
and
parties
worked
together
through
political
process
to
produce
new
constitution
we
see
it
in
senegal
where
civil
society
thrives
alongside
strong
democratic
government
we
see
it
in
malaysia
where
vibrant
entrepreneurship
is
propelling
former
colony
into
the
ranks
of
advanced
economies
and
we
see
it
in
where
what
began
as
violent
transition
has
evolved
into
genuine
democracy
now
ultimately
the
task
of
rejecting
sectarianism
and
rejecting
extremism
is
generational
task
and
task
for
the
people
of
the
middle
east
themselves
no
external
power
can
bring
about
transformation
of
hearts
and
minds
but
america
will
be
respectful
and
constructive
partner
we
will
neither
tolerate
terrorist
safe
havens
nor
act
as
an
occupying
power
we
will
take
action
against
threats
to
our
security
and
our
allies
while
building
an
architecture
of
cooperation
we
will
increase
efforts
to
lift
up
those
who
counter
extremist
ideologies
and
who
seek
to
resolve
sectarian
conflict
and
we
will
expand
our
programs
to
support
entrepreneurship
and
civil
society
education
and
youth
because
ultimately
these
investments
are
the
best
antidote
to
violence
we
as
well
that
leadership
will
be
necessary
to
address
the
conflict
between
and
israelis
as
bleak
as
the
landscape
appears
america
will
not
give
up
on
the
pursuit
of
peace
understand
the
situation
in
iraq
and
syria
and
libya
should
cure
anybody
of
the
illusion
that
the
conflict
is
the
main
source
of
problems
in
the
region
for
far
too
long
that
been
used
as
an
excuse
to
distract
people
from
problems
at
home
the
violence
engulfing
the
region
today
has
made
too
many
israelis
ready
to
abandon
the
hard
work
of
peace
and
that
something
worthy
of
reflection
within
israel
because
be
clear
the
status
in
the
west
bank
and
is
not
sustainable
we
can
not
afford
to
turn
away
from
this
effort
not
when
rockets
are
fired
at
innocent
israelis
or
the
lives
of
so
many
children
are
taken
from
us
in
so
long
as
am
president
we
will
stand
up
for
the
principle
that
israelis
the
region
and
the
world
will
be
more
just
and
more
safe
with
two
states
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
so
this
is
what
america
is
prepared
to
do
taking
action
against
immediate
threats
while
pursuing
world
in
which
the
need
for
such
action
is
diminished
the
united
states
will
never
shy
away
from
defending
our
interests
but
we
will
also
not
shy
away
from
the
promise
of
this
institution
and
its
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
the
notion
that
peace
is
not
merely
the
absence
of
war
but
the
presence
of
better
life
that
critics
will
be
quick
to
point
out
that
at
times
we
too
have
failed
to
live
up
to
our
ideals
that
america
has
plenty
of
problems
within
its
own
borders
this
is
true
in
summer
marked
by
instability
in
the
middle
east
and
eastern
europe
know
the
world
also
took
notice
of
the
small
american
city
of
missouri
where
young
man
was
killed
and
community
was
divided
so
yes
we
have
our
own
racial
and
ethnic
tensions
and
like
every
country
we
continually
wrestle
with
how
to
reconcile
the
vast
changes
wrought
by
and
greater
diversity
with
the
traditions
that
we
hold
dear
but
we
welcome
the
scrutiny
of
the
world
because
what
you
see
in
america
is
country
that
has
steadily
worked
to
address
our
problems
to
make
our
union
more
perfect
to
bridge
the
divides
that
existed
at
the
founding
of
this
nation
america
is
not
the
same
as
it
was
years
ago
or
years
ago
or
even
decade
ago
because
we
fight
for
our
ideals
and
we
are
willing
to
ourselves
when
we
fall
short
because
we
hold
our
leaders
accountable
and
insist
on
free
press
and
independent
judiciary
because
we
address
our
differences
in
the
open
space
of
democracy
with
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
with
place
for
people
of
every
race
and
every
religion
and
with
an
unyielding
belief
in
the
ability
of
individual
men
and
women
to
change
their
communities
and
their
circumstances
and
their
countries
for
the
better
after
nearly
six
years
as
president
believe
that
this
promise
can
help
light
the
world
because
have
seen
longing
for
positive
change
for
peace
and
for
freedom
and
for
opportunity
and
for
the
end
to
bigotry
in
the
eyes
of
young
people
who
met
around
the
globe
they
remind
me
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
or
what
you
look
like
or
what
god
you
pray
to
or
who
you
love
there
is
something
fundamental
that
we
all
share
champion
of
the
and
role
in
it
once
asked
after
all
do
universal
human
rights
begin
in
small
places
she
said
to
home
so
close
and
so
small
that
they
can
not
be
seen
on
any
maps
of
the
world
yet
they
are
the
world
of
the
individual
person
the
he
lives
in
the
school
or
college
he
attends
the
factory
farm
or
office
where
he
around
the
world
young
people
are
moving
forward
hungry
for
better
world
around
the
world
in
small
places
they
overcoming
hatred
and
bigotry
and
sectarianism
and
they
learning
to
respect
each
other
despite
differences
the
people
of
the
world
now
look
to
us
here
to
be
as
decent
and
as
dignified
and
as
courageous
as
they
are
trying
to
be
in
their
daily
lives
and
at
this
crossroads
can
promise
you
that
the
united
states
of
america
will
not
be
distracted
or
deterred
from
what
must
be
done
we
are
heirs
to
proud
legacy
of
freedom
and
prepared
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
secure
that
legacy
for
generations
to
come
ask
that
you
join
us
in
this
common
mission
for
children
and
thank
you
very
much
my
fellow
americans
tonight
like
to
talk
with
you
about
immigration
for
more
than
years
our
tradition
of
welcoming
immigrants
from
around
the
world
has
given
us
tremendous
advantage
over
other
nations
kept
us
youthful
dynamic
and
entrepreneurial
it
has
shaped
our
character
as
people
with
limitless
possibilities
people
not
trapped
by
our
past
but
able
to
remake
ourselves
as
we
choose
but
today
our
immigration
system
is
broken
and
everybody
knows
it
families
who
enter
our
country
the
right
way
and
play
by
the
rules
watch
others
flout
the
rules
business
owners
who
offer
their
workers
good
wages
and
benefits
see
the
competition
exploit
undocumented
immigrants
by
paying
them
far
less
all
of
us
take
to
anyone
who
reaps
the
rewards
of
living
in
america
without
taking
on
the
responsibilities
of
living
in
america
and
undocumented
immigrants
who
desperately
want
to
embrace
those
responsibilities
see
little
option
but
to
remain
in
the
shadows
or
risk
their
families
being
torn
apart
been
this
way
for
decades
and
for
decades
we
done
much
about
it
when
took
office
committed
to
fixing
this
broken
immigration
system
and
began
by
doing
what
could
to
secure
our
borders
today
we
have
more
agents
and
technology
deployed
to
secure
our
southern
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
and
over
the
past
six
years
illegal
border
crossings
have
been
cut
by
more
than
half
although
this
summer
there
was
brief
spike
in
unaccompanied
children
being
apprehended
at
our
border
the
number
of
such
children
is
now
actually
lower
than
been
in
nearly
two
years
overall
the
number
of
people
trying
to
cross
our
border
illegally
is
at
its
lowest
level
since
the
those
are
the
facts
meanwhile
worked
with
congress
on
comprehensive
fix
and
last
year
democrats
republicans
and
independents
came
together
to
pass
bipartisan
bill
in
the
senate
it
perfect
it
was
compromise
but
it
reflected
common
sense
it
would
have
doubled
the
number
of
border
patrol
agents
while
giving
undocumented
immigrants
pathway
to
citizenship
if
they
paid
fine
started
paying
their
taxes
and
went
to
the
back
of
the
line
and
independent
experts
said
that
it
would
help
grow
our
economy
and
shrink
our
deficits
had
the
house
of
representatives
allowed
that
kind
of
bill
simple
vote
it
would
have
passed
with
support
from
both
parties
and
today
it
would
be
the
law
but
for
year
and
half
now
republican
leaders
in
the
house
have
refused
to
allow
that
simple
vote
now
continue
to
believe
that
the
best
way
to
solve
this
problem
is
by
working
together
to
pass
that
kind
of
common
sense
law
but
until
that
happens
there
are
actions
have
the
legal
authority
to
take
as
president
the
same
kinds
of
actions
taken
by
democratic
and
republican
presidents
before
me
that
will
help
make
our
immigration
system
more
fair
and
more
just
tonight
am
announcing
those
actions
first
build
on
our
progress
at
the
border
with
additional
resources
for
our
law
enforcement
personnel
so
that
they
can
stem
the
flow
of
illegal
crossings
and
speed
the
return
of
those
who
do
cross
over
second
make
it
easier
and
faster
for
immigrants
graduates
and
entrepreneurs
to
stay
and
contribute
to
our
economy
as
so
many
business
leaders
have
proposed
third
take
steps
to
deal
responsibly
with
the
millions
of
undocumented
immigrants
who
already
live
in
our
country
want
to
say
more
about
this
third
issue
because
it
generates
the
most
passion
and
controversy
even
as
we
are
nation
of
immigrants
also
nation
of
laws
undocumented
workers
broke
our
immigration
laws
and
believe
that
they
must
be
held
accountable
especially
those
who
may
be
dangerous
why
over
the
past
six
years
deportations
of
criminals
are
up
percent
and
why
going
to
keep
focusing
enforcement
resources
on
actual
threats
to
our
security
felons
not
families
criminals
not
children
gang
members
not
mom
working
hard
to
provide
for
her
kids
just
like
law
enforcement
does
every
day
but
even
as
we
focus
on
deporting
criminals
the
fact
is
millions
of
immigrants
in
every
state
of
every
race
and
nationality
still
live
here
illegally
and
be
honest
tracking
down
rounding
up
and
deporting
millions
of
people
realistic
anyone
who
suggests
otherwise
being
straight
with
you
also
not
who
we
are
as
americans
after
all
most
of
these
immigrants
have
been
here
long
time
they
work
hard
often
in
tough
jobs
they
support
their
families
they
worship
at
our
churches
many
of
their
kids
are
or
spent
most
of
their
lives
here
and
their
hopes
dreams
and
patriotism
are
just
like
ours
as
my
predecessor
president
bush
once
put
it
are
part
of
american
now
the
thing
we
expect
people
who
live
in
this
country
to
play
by
the
rules
we
expect
that
those
who
cut
the
line
will
not
be
unfairly
rewarded
so
going
to
offer
the
following
deal
if
been
in
america
for
more
than
five
years
if
you
have
children
who
are
american
citizens
or
legal
residents
if
you
register
pass
criminal
background
check
and
willing
to
pay
your
fair
share
of
taxes
be
able
to
apply
to
stay
in
this
country
temporarily
without
fear
of
deportation
you
can
come
out
of
the
shadows
and
get
right
with
the
law
what
this
deal
is
now
be
clear
about
what
it
this
deal
does
not
apply
to
anyone
who
has
come
to
this
country
recently
it
does
not
apply
to
anyone
who
might
come
to
america
illegally
in
the
future
it
does
not
grant
citizenship
or
the
right
to
stay
here
permanently
or
offer
the
same
benefits
that
citizens
receive
only
congress
can
do
that
all
saying
is
not
going
to
deport
you
know
some
of
the
critics
of
this
action
call
it
amnesty
well
not
amnesty
is
the
immigration
system
we
have
today
millions
of
people
who
live
here
without
paying
their
taxes
or
playing
by
the
rules
while
politicians
use
the
issue
to
scare
people
and
whip
up
votes
at
election
time
the
real
amnesty
leaving
this
broken
system
the
way
it
is
mass
amnesty
would
be
unfair
mass
deportation
would
be
both
impossible
and
contrary
to
our
character
what
describing
is
accountability
approach
if
you
meet
the
criteria
you
can
come
out
of
the
shadows
and
get
right
with
the
law
if
criminal
be
deported
if
you
plan
to
enter
the
illegally
your
chances
of
getting
caught
and
sent
back
just
went
up
the
actions
taking
are
not
only
lawful
the
kinds
of
actions
taken
by
every
single
republican
president
and
every
single
democratic
president
for
the
past
half
century
and
to
those
members
of
congress
who
question
my
authority
to
make
our
immigration
system
work
better
or
question
the
wisdom
of
me
acting
where
congress
has
failed
have
one
answer
pass
bill
want
to
work
with
both
parties
to
pass
more
permanent
legislative
solution
and
the
day
sign
that
bill
into
law
the
actions
take
will
no
longer
be
necessary
meanwhile
let
disagreement
over
single
issue
be
on
every
issue
not
how
our
democracy
works
and
congress
certainly
shut
down
our
government
again
just
because
we
disagree
on
this
americans
are
tired
of
gridlock
what
our
country
needs
from
us
right
now
is
common
purpose
higher
purpose
most
americans
support
the
types
of
reforms
talked
about
tonight
but
understand
the
disagreements
held
by
many
of
you
at
home
millions
of
us
myself
included
go
back
generations
in
this
country
with
ancestors
who
put
in
the
painstaking
work
to
become
citizens
so
we
like
the
notion
that
anyone
might
get
free
pass
to
american
citizenship
know
some
worry
immigration
will
change
the
very
fabric
of
who
we
are
or
take
our
jobs
or
stick
it
to
families
at
time
when
they
already
feel
like
gotten
the
raw
deal
for
over
decade
hear
these
concerns
but
not
what
these
steps
would
do
our
history
and
the
facts
show
that
immigrants
are
net
plus
for
our
economy
and
our
society
and
believe
important
that
all
of
us
have
this
debate
without
impugning
each
character
because
for
all
the
back
and
forth
of
washington
we
have
to
remember
that
this
debate
is
about
something
bigger
about
who
we
are
as
country
and
who
we
want
to
be
for
future
generations
are
we
nation
that
tolerates
the
hypocrisy
of
system
where
workers
who
pick
our
fruit
and
make
our
beds
never
have
chance
to
get
right
with
the
law
or
are
we
nation
that
gives
them
chance
to
make
amends
take
responsibility
and
give
their
kids
better
future
are
we
nation
that
accepts
the
cruelty
of
ripping
children
from
their
arms
or
are
we
nation
that
values
families
and
works
together
to
keep
them
together
are
we
nation
that
educates
the
best
and
brightest
in
our
universities
only
to
send
them
home
to
create
businesses
in
countries
that
compete
against
us
or
are
we
nation
that
encourages
them
to
stay
and
create
jobs
here
create
businesses
here
create
industries
right
here
in
america
what
this
debate
is
all
about
we
need
more
than
politics
as
usual
when
it
comes
to
immigration
we
need
reasoned
thoughtful
compassionate
debate
that
focuses
on
our
hopes
not
our
fears
know
the
politics
of
this
issue
are
tough
but
let
me
tell
you
why
have
come
to
feel
so
strongly
about
it
over
the
past
few
years
have
seen
the
determination
of
immigrant
fathers
who
worked
two
or
three
jobs
without
taking
dime
from
the
government
and
at
risk
any
moment
of
losing
it
all
just
to
build
better
life
for
their
kids
seen
the
heartbreak
and
anxiety
of
children
whose
mothers
might
be
taken
away
from
them
just
because
they
have
the
right
papers
seen
the
courage
of
students
who
except
for
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
are
as
american
as
or
students
who
bravely
come
out
as
undocumented
in
hopes
they
could
make
difference
in
the
country
they
love
these
people
our
our
classmates
our
friends
they
did
not
come
here
in
search
of
free
ride
or
an
easy
life
they
came
to
work
and
study
and
serve
in
our
military
and
above
all
contribute
to
success
tomorrow
travel
to
las
and
meet
with
some
of
these
students
including
young
woman
named
was
brought
to
america
when
she
was
four
years
old
her
only
possessions
were
cross
her
doll
and
the
frilly
dress
she
had
on
when
she
started
school
she
speak
any
english
she
caught
up
to
other
kids
by
reading
newspapers
and
watching
and
she
became
good
student
her
father
worked
in
landscaping
her
mom
cleaned
other
homes
they
let
apply
to
technology
magnet
school
not
because
they
love
her
but
because
they
were
afraid
the
paperwork
would
out
her
as
an
undocumented
immigrant
so
she
applied
behind
their
back
and
got
in
still
she
mostly
lived
in
the
shadows
until
her
grandmother
who
visited
every
year
from
mexico
passed
away
and
she
travel
to
the
funeral
without
risk
of
being
found
out
and
deported
it
was
around
that
time
she
decided
to
begin
advocating
for
herself
and
others
like
her
and
today
is
college
student
working
on
her
third
degree
are
we
nation
that
kicks
out
striving
hopeful
immigrant
like
or
are
we
nation
that
finds
way
to
welcome
her
in
scripture
tells
us
that
we
shall
not
oppress
stranger
for
we
know
the
heart
of
stranger
we
were
strangers
once
too
my
fellow
americans
we
are
and
always
will
be
nation
of
immigrants
we
were
strangers
once
too
and
whether
our
forebears
were
strangers
who
crossed
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
or
the
we
are
here
only
because
this
country
welcomed
them
in
and
taught
them
that
to
be
an
american
is
about
something
more
than
what
we
look
like
or
what
our
last
names
are
or
how
we
worship
what
makes
us
americans
is
our
shared
commitment
to
an
ideal
that
all
of
us
are
created
equal
and
all
of
us
have
the
chance
to
make
of
our
lives
what
we
will
the
country
our
parents
and
grandparents
and
generations
before
them
built
for
us
the
tradition
we
must
uphold
the
legacy
we
must
leave
for
those
who
are
yet
to
come
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
this
country
we
love
good
afternoon
today
the
united
states
of
america
is
changing
its
relationship
with
the
people
of
cuba
in
the
most
significant
changes
in
our
policy
in
more
than
fifty
years
we
will
end
an
outdated
approach
that
for
decades
has
failed
to
advance
our
interests
and
instead
we
will
begin
to
relations
between
our
two
countries
through
these
changes
we
intend
to
create
more
opportunities
for
the
american
and
cuban
people
and
begin
new
chapter
among
the
nations
of
the
complicated
history
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
was
born
in
just
over
two
years
after
took
power
in
cuba
and
just
few
months
after
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
which
tried
to
overthrow
his
regime
over
the
next
several
decades
the
relationship
between
our
countries
played
out
against
the
backdrop
of
the
cold
war
and
steadfast
opposition
to
communism
we
are
separated
by
just
over
miles
but
year
after
year
an
ideological
and
economic
barrier
hardened
between
our
two
countries
meanwhile
the
cuban
exile
community
in
the
united
states
made
enormous
contributions
to
our
country
in
politics
and
business
culture
and
sports
like
immigrants
before
cubans
helped
remake
america
even
as
they
felt
painful
yearning
for
the
land
and
families
they
left
behind
all
of
this
bound
america
and
cuba
in
unique
relationship
at
once
family
and
foe
proudly
the
united
states
has
supported
democracy
and
human
rights
in
cuba
through
these
five
decades
we
have
done
so
primarily
through
policies
that
aimed
to
isolate
the
island
preventing
the
most
basic
travel
and
commerce
that
americans
can
enjoy
anyplace
else
and
though
this
policy
has
been
rooted
in
the
best
of
intentions
no
other
nation
joins
us
in
imposing
these
sanctions
and
it
has
had
little
effect
beyond
providing
the
cuban
government
with
rationale
for
restrictions
on
its
people
today
cuba
is
still
governed
by
the
and
the
communist
party
that
came
to
power
half
century
ago
neither
the
american
nor
cuban
people
are
well
served
by
rigid
policy
that
is
rooted
in
events
that
took
place
before
most
of
us
were
born
consider
that
for
more
than
years
had
relations
with
china
far
larger
country
also
governed
by
communist
party
nearly
two
decades
ago
we
relations
with
where
we
fought
war
that
claimed
more
americans
than
any
cold
war
confrontation
why
when
came
into
office
promised
to
our
cuba
policy
as
start
we
lifted
restrictions
for
cuban
americans
to
travel
and
send
remittances
to
their
families
in
cuba
these
changes
once
controversial
now
seem
obvious
cuban
americans
have
been
reunited
with
their
families
and
are
the
best
possible
ambassadors
for
our
values
and
through
these
exchanges
younger
generation
of
cuban
americans
has
increasingly
questioned
an
approach
that
does
more
to
keep
cuba
closed
off
from
an
interconnected
world
while
have
been
prepared
to
take
additional
steps
for
some
time
major
obstacle
stood
in
our
way
the
wrongful
imprisonment
in
cuba
of
citizen
and
gross
for
five
years
over
many
months
my
administration
has
held
discussions
with
the
cuban
government
about
case
and
other
aspects
of
our
relationship
his
holiness
pope
issued
personal
appeal
to
me
and
to
president
urging
us
to
resolve
case
and
to
address
interest
in
the
release
of
three
cuban
agents
who
have
been
jailed
in
the
united
states
for
over
years
today
returned
home
reunited
with
his
family
at
long
last
was
released
by
the
cuban
government
on
humanitarian
grounds
separately
in
exchange
for
the
three
cuban
agents
cuba
today
released
one
of
the
most
important
intelligence
agents
that
the
united
states
has
ever
had
in
cuba
and
who
has
been
imprisoned
for
nearly
two
decades
this
man
whose
sacrifice
has
been
known
to
only
few
provided
america
with
the
information
that
allowed
us
to
arrest
the
network
of
cuban
agents
that
included
the
men
transferred
to
cuba
today
as
well
as
other
spies
in
the
united
states
this
man
is
now
safely
on
our
shores
having
recovered
these
two
men
who
sacrificed
for
our
country
now
taking
steps
to
place
the
interests
of
the
people
of
both
countries
at
the
heart
of
our
policy
first
instructed
secretary
to
immediately
begin
discussions
with
cuba
to
diplomatic
relations
that
have
been
severed
since
january
of
going
forward
the
united
states
will
an
embassy
in
havana
and
officials
will
visit
cuba
where
we
can
advance
shared
interests
we
will
on
issues
like
health
migration
drug
trafficking
and
disaster
response
indeed
seen
the
benefits
of
cooperation
between
our
countries
before
it
was
cuban
who
discovered
that
carry
yellow
fever
his
work
helped
reed
fight
it
cuba
has
sent
hundreds
of
health
care
workers
to
africa
to
fight
and
believe
american
and
cuban
health
care
workers
should
work
side
by
side
to
stop
the
spread
of
this
deadly
disease
now
where
we
disagree
we
will
raise
those
differences
directly
as
we
will
continue
to
do
on
issues
related
to
democracy
and
human
rights
in
cuba
but
believe
that
we
can
do
more
to
support
the
cuban
people
and
promote
our
values
through
engagement
after
all
these
years
have
shown
that
isolation
has
not
worked
time
for
new
approach
second
instructed
secretary
to
review
designation
as
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
this
review
will
be
guided
by
the
facts
and
the
law
terrorism
has
changed
in
the
last
several
decades
at
time
when
we
are
focused
on
threats
from
to
nation
that
meets
our
conditions
and
renounces
the
use
of
terrorism
should
not
face
this
sanction
third
we
are
taking
steps
to
increase
travel
commerce
and
the
flow
of
information
to
and
from
cuba
this
is
fundamentally
about
freedom
and
openness
and
also
expresses
my
belief
in
the
power
of
engagement
with
the
changes
announcing
today
it
will
be
easier
for
americans
to
travel
to
cuba
and
americans
will
be
able
to
use
american
credit
and
debit
cards
on
the
island
nobody
represents
values
better
than
the
american
people
and
believe
this
contact
will
ultimately
do
more
to
empower
the
cuban
people
also
believe
that
more
resources
should
be
able
to
reach
the
cuban
people
so
significantly
increasing
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
sent
to
cuba
and
removing
limits
on
remittances
that
support
humanitarian
projects
the
cuban
people
and
the
emerging
cuban
private
sector
believe
that
american
businesses
should
not
be
put
at
disadvantage
and
that
increased
commerce
is
good
for
americans
and
for
cubans
so
we
will
facilitate
transactions
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
financial
institutions
will
be
allowed
to
open
accounts
at
cuban
financial
institutions
and
it
will
be
easier
for
exporters
to
sell
goods
in
cuba
believe
in
the
free
flow
of
information
unfortunately
our
sanctions
on
cuba
have
denied
cubans
access
to
technology
that
has
empowered
individuals
around
the
globe
so
increased
telecommunications
connections
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
businesses
will
be
able
to
sell
goods
that
enable
cubans
to
communicate
with
the
united
states
and
other
countries
these
are
the
steps
that
can
take
as
president
to
change
this
policy
the
embargo
been
imposed
for
decades
is
now
codified
in
legislation
as
these
changes
unfold
look
forward
to
engaging
congress
in
an
honest
and
serious
debate
about
lifting
the
embargo
yesterday
spoke
with
to
release
and
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
to
describe
how
we
will
move
forward
made
clear
my
strong
belief
that
cuban
society
is
constrained
by
restrictions
on
its
citizens
in
addition
to
the
return
of
gross
and
the
release
of
our
intelligence
agent
we
welcome
decision
to
release
substantial
number
of
prisoners
whose
cases
were
directly
raised
with
the
cuban
government
by
my
team
we
welcome
decision
to
provide
more
access
to
the
internet
for
its
citizens
and
to
continue
increasing
engagement
with
international
institutions
like
the
united
nations
and
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
that
promote
universal
values
but
under
no
illusion
about
the
continued
barriers
to
freedom
that
remain
for
ordinary
cubans
the
united
states
believes
that
no
cubans
should
face
harassment
or
arrest
or
beatings
simply
because
exercising
universal
right
to
have
their
voices
heard
and
we
will
continue
to
support
civil
society
there
while
cuba
has
made
reforms
to
gradually
open
up
its
economy
we
continue
to
believe
that
cuban
workers
should
be
free
to
form
unions
just
as
their
citizens
should
be
free
to
participate
in
the
political
process
moreover
given
history
expect
it
will
continue
to
pursue
foreign
policies
that
will
at
times
be
sharply
at
odds
with
american
interests
do
not
expect
the
changes
am
announcing
today
to
bring
about
transformation
of
cuban
society
overnight
but
am
convinced
that
through
policy
of
engagement
we
can
more
effectively
stand
up
for
our
values
and
help
the
cuban
people
help
themselves
as
they
move
into
the
century
to
those
who
oppose
the
steps
announcing
today
let
me
say
that
respect
your
passion
and
share
your
commitment
to
liberty
and
democracy
the
question
is
how
we
uphold
that
commitment
do
not
believe
we
can
keep
doing
the
same
thing
for
over
five
decades
and
expect
different
result
moreover
it
does
not
serve
interests
or
the
cuban
people
to
try
to
push
cuba
toward
collapse
even
if
that
worked
and
it
for
years
we
know
from
experience
that
countries
are
more
likely
to
enjoy
lasting
transformation
if
their
people
are
not
subjected
to
chaos
we
are
calling
on
cuba
to
unleash
the
potential
of
million
cubans
by
ending
unnecessary
restrictions
on
their
political
social
and
economic
activities
in
that
spirit
we
should
not
allow
sanctions
to
add
to
the
burden
of
cuban
citizens
that
we
seek
to
help
to
the
cuban
people
america
extends
hand
of
friendship
some
of
you
have
looked
to
us
as
source
of
hope
and
we
will
continue
to
shine
light
of
freedom
others
have
seen
us
as
former
intent
on
controlling
your
future
once
said
is
the
right
of
every
man
to
be
today
am
being
honest
with
you
we
can
never
erase
the
history
between
us
but
we
believe
that
you
should
be
empowered
to
live
with
dignity
and
cubans
have
saying
about
daily
life
not
easy
today
the
united
states
wants
to
be
partner
in
making
the
lives
of
ordinary
cubans
little
bit
easier
more
free
more
prosperous
to
those
who
have
supported
these
measures
thank
you
for
being
partners
in
our
efforts
in
particular
want
to
thank
his
holiness
pope
whose
moral
example
shows
us
the
importance
of
pursuing
the
world
as
it
should
be
rather
than
simply
settling
for
the
world
as
it
is
the
government
of
canada
which
hosted
our
discussions
with
the
cuban
government
and
bipartisan
group
of
congressmen
who
have
worked
tirelessly
for
release
and
for
new
approach
to
advancing
our
interests
and
values
in
cuba
finally
our
shift
in
policy
towards
cuba
comes
at
moment
of
renewed
leadership
in
the
this
april
we
are
prepared
to
have
cuba
join
the
other
nations
of
the
hemisphere
at
the
summit
of
the
but
we
will
insist
that
civil
society
join
us
so
that
citizens
not
just
leaders
are
shaping
our
future
and
call
on
all
of
my
fellow
leaders
to
give
meaning
to
the
commitment
to
democracy
and
human
rights
at
the
heart
of
the
charter
let
us
leave
behind
the
legacy
of
both
and
communism
the
tyranny
of
drug
cartels
dictators
and
sham
elections
future
of
greater
peace
security
and
democratic
development
is
possible
if
we
work
together
not
to
maintain
power
not
to
secure
vested
interest
but
instead
to
advance
the
dreams
of
our
citizens
my
fellow
americans
the
city
of
miami
is
only
miles
or
so
from
havana
countless
thousands
of
cubans
have
come
to
miami
on
planes
and
makeshift
rafts
some
with
little
but
the
shirt
on
their
back
and
hope
in
their
hearts
today
miami
is
often
referred
to
as
the
capital
of
latin
america
but
it
is
also
profoundly
american
city
place
that
reminds
us
that
ideals
matter
more
than
the
of
our
skin
or
the
circumstances
of
our
birth
demonstration
of
what
the
cuban
people
can
achieve
and
the
openness
of
the
united
states
to
our
family
to
the
south
change
is
hard
in
our
own
lives
and
in
the
lives
of
nations
and
change
is
even
harder
when
we
carry
the
heavy
weight
of
history
on
our
shoulders
but
today
we
are
making
these
changes
because
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
today
america
chooses
to
cut
loose
the
shackles
of
the
past
so
as
to
reach
for
better
future
for
the
cuban
people
for
the
american
people
for
our
entire
hemisphere
and
for
the
world
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
hello
everybody
hey
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
thank
you
everybody
thank
you
everybody
please
have
seat
please
have
seat
well
it
is
good
to
be
back
in
hope
you
guys
getting
tired
of
me
been
coming
around
lot
lately
because
lot
of
good
stuff
happening
here
want
to
begin
by
thanking
and
not
just
good
friends
and
good
partners
but
they
really
believe
in
the
power
of
education
and
they
really
believe
in
creating
those
kinds
of
ladders
of
opportunity
that
gave
all
three
of
us
and
the
chances
the
incredible
opportunities
that
had
today
and
they
understand
the
promise
of
community
colleges
well
really
understands
it
and
he
really
have
choice
before
get
into
the
reason
that
here
today
want
to
begin
by
saying
just
few
words
about
the
tragic
events
that
watched
unfold
in
france
over
the
last
several
hours
and
days
and
because
events
have
been
this
morning
wanted
to
make
sure
to
comment
on
them
just
spoke
to
my
we
have
been
in
close
touch
with
the
french
government
throughout
this
tragedy
the
moment
that
the
outrageous
attack
took
place
we
directed
all
of
our
law
enforcement
and
counterintelligence
operations
to
provide
whatever
support
that
our
ally
needs
in
confronting
this
challenge
hopeful
that
the
immediate
threat
is
now
resolved
thanks
to
the
courage
and
professionalism
of
the
french
personnel
on
the
ground
but
the
french
government
continues
to
face
the
threat
of
terrorism
and
has
to
remain
vigilant
the
situation
is
fluid
president
has
made
it
clear
that
going
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
protect
their
people
and
think
important
for
us
to
understand
france
is
our
oldest
ally
want
the
people
of
france
to
know
that
the
united
states
stands
with
you
today
stands
with
you
tomorrow
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
families
who
have
been
directly
impacted
we
grieve
with
you
we
fight
alongside
you
to
uphold
our
values
the
values
that
we
share
universal
values
that
bind
us
together
as
friends
and
as
allies
and
in
the
streets
of
paris
the
world
has
seen
once
again
what
terrorists
stand
for
they
have
nothing
to
offer
but
hatred
and
human
suffering
and
we
stand
for
freedom
and
hope
and
the
dignity
of
all
human
beings
and
what
the
city
of
paris
represents
to
the
world
and
that
spirit
will
endure
forever
long
after
the
scourge
of
terrorism
is
banished
from
this
world
now
in
not
only
because
just
like
but
here
today
because
one
of
my
resolutions
is
to
make
sure
that
folks
across
this
great
country
feel
like
they
are
coming
back
and
there
is
no
doubt
thanks
to
the
steps
we
took
early
on
to
rescue
our
economy
and
to
rebuild
it
on
new
foundation
america
is
coming
back
now
not
running
for
office
anymore
so
let
me
just
present
the
facts
promised
that
would
be
breakthrough
year
for
america
this
morning
we
got
more
evidence
to
back
that
up
in
december
our
businesses
created
new
jobs
our
unemployment
rate
fell
to
percent
which
is
the
lowest
in
six
and
half
years
what
that
means
is
was
the
strongest
year
for
job
growth
since
the
unemployment
fell
in
faster
than
any
year
since
now
think
about
that
been
years
since
unemployment
fell
as
fast
as
it
did
last
year
and
most
importantly
seeing
faster
job
growth
in
industries
that
provide
jobs
traditionally
jobs
than
anything
else
since
the
united
states
of
america
has
create
more
jobs
than
europe
japan
and
every
other
advanced
economy
combined
american
manufacturing
is
in
its
best
stretch
of
job
growth
since
the
actually
seeing
companies
instead
of
outsourcing
we
want
to
be
here
with
american
workers
making
american
products
america
is
now
the
producer
in
oil
gas
doubled
the
production
of
clean
energy
and
by
the
way
saving
about
gallon
at
the
pump
over
this
time
last
year
although
keep
on
reminding
folks
gas
prices
they
go
up
and
they
come
down
and
then
they
go
up
so
just
want
everybody
to
know
that
you
should
enjoy
this
take
the
money
saving
pay
off
the
credit
card
or
go
get
new
appliance
or
buy
car
so
that
when
prices
go
back
up
still
thanks
to
the
affordable
care
act
about
million
americans
have
gained
health
insurance
over
the
past
year
and
by
the
way
done
this
while
cutting
our
deficits
by
about
everybody
thinks
that
they
did
survey
in
every
survey
they
ask
is
the
deficit
going
up
or
going
down
and
percent
of
americans
say
that
the
deficit
is
going
up
the
deficit
has
come
down
by
since
took
office
meanwhile
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
students
and
educators
dropout
rates
are
down
graduation
rates
are
up
and
after
long
years
our
war
in
has
come
to
responsible
end
and
got
more
troops
that
were
home
this
holiday
season
so
say
all
this
because
these
six
years
have
demanded
lot
of
hard
work
and
lot
of
sacrifice
on
part
and
as
country
got
every
right
to
be
proud
of
what
got
to
show
for
it
resurgence
is
real
and
now
that
seen
calmer
waters
economically
if
we
all
do
our
part
if
we
all
pitch
in
then
we
can
start
making
sure
that
all
boats
are
actually
lifted
again
and
wages
and
incomes
start
rising
again
and
we
can
make
sure
that
the
middle
class
is
the
engine
that
powers
prosperity
just
as
it
always
has
so
going
to
be
the
focus
of
my
state
of
the
union
address
in
couple
weeks
wanted
to
give
you
little
preview
tell
anybody
said
this
giving
you
the
inside
scoop
going
to
be
the
essence
of
my
message
how
do
we
build
on
the
progress
that
made
and
figured
why
wait
for
the
state
of
the
union
why
stand
on
formalities
get
the
ball
rolling
right
now
two
days
ago
visited
michigan
where
workers
have
brought
the
auto
industry
roaring
back
and
we
talked
about
what
else
we
can
do
around
advanced
manufacturing
yesterday
was
in
arizona
where
announced
new
actions
to
make
the
dream
of
reality
for
more
families
later
today
and
are
going
to
head
to
company
in
to
take
action
that
will
develop
industry
even
further
here
in
and
right
here
right
now
at
state
going
to
announce
one
of
my
most
important
state
of
the
union
proposals
and
helping
every
american
afford
higher
education
now
part
of
the
reason
wanted
to
come
here
was
because
is
at
the
forefront
of
doing
some
really
smart
stuff
and
got
some
proud
who
can
take
some
credit
for
the
great
work
been
done
first
your
governor
bill
here
your
two
very
fine
senators
got
bob
and
your
senior
senator
former
secretary
of
education
himself
so
he
knows
little
bit
about
this
got
congressman
john
your
mayor
and
we
got
president
wise
hey
and
we
got
all
of
you
now
and
both
already
touched
on
these
themes
but
let
me
just
amplify
them
little
bit
here
in
america
we
do
guarantee
equal
outcomes
some
folks
work
harder
some
folks
do
some
folks
take
advantage
of
opportunities
some
folks
do
some
people
have
good
luck
some
people
have
bad
luck
and
things
do
always
work
out
where
everything
is
perfectly
equal
but
we
do
expect
that
everybody
gets
an
equal
shot
we
do
expect
everybody
can
go
as
far
as
their
dreams
and
hard
work
will
take
them
we
do
expect
anybody
to
be
bound
by
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
if
they
were
would
be
here
and
neither
would
so
accomplished
she
would
have
succeeded
no
matter
what
but
we
expect
everybody
to
get
fair
shot
and
in
exchange
we
do
our
fair
share
that
the
basic
bargain
at
the
heart
of
this
country
if
you
work
hard
you
can
get
ahead
it
matter
what
your
last
name
is
or
what
we
look
like
or
what
family
we
were
born
into
or
how
we
worship
what
matters
is
effort
and
merit
that
the
promise
of
america
and
the
way
we
deliver
on
that
is
making
sure
that
our
education
system
works
on
behalf
of
every
person
who
lives
here
america
thrived
in
the
century
in
large
part
because
we
made
high
school
the
norm
and
then
we
sent
generation
to
college
on
the
bill
including
my
grandfather
then
we
dedicated
ourselves
to
cultivating
the
most
educated
workforce
in
the
world
and
we
invested
in
one
of
the
crown
jewels
of
this
country
and
that
our
higher
education
system
and
dating
back
to
abraham
lincoln
we
invested
in
colleges
we
understood
that
this
was
hallmark
of
america
this
investment
in
education
but
eventually
the
world
caught
on
and
the
world
caught
up
and
why
we
have
to
lead
the
world
in
education
again
why
my
administration
is
working
to
make
early
childhood
education
available
to
all
of
our
kids
we
know
if
we
invest
in
them
early
that
it
pays
dividends
on
the
that
why
we
working
to
bring
broadband
to
percent
of
students
within
the
next
four
years
we
want
to
make
sure
every
child
is
plugged
in
that
why
we
recruiting
more
highly
trained
math
and
science
teachers
that
why
working
to
raise
standards
and
invest
more
in
our
elementary
and
middle
and
high
schools
so
that
every
young
person
is
prepared
for
competitive
world
and
this
work
is
not
easy
sometimes
it
controversial
it
not
going
to
be
the
same
in
every
state
but
in
places
like
we
seeing
incredible
strides
as
consequence
of
these
efforts
over
the
past
few
years
students
have
improved
their
reading
scores
and
math
scores
more
than
any
other
state
in
the
country
credit
to
their
hard
work
their
hard
work
to
governor
hard
work
leaders
from
both
parties
it
been
bipartisan
effort
every
should
be
proud
of
that
and
today
in
century
economy
where
your
most
valuable
asset
is
your
knowledge
the
single
most
important
way
to
get
ahead
is
not
just
to
get
high
school
education
got
to
get
some
higher
education
why
all
of
you
are
here
now
the
value
of
an
education
is
not
purely
instrumental
education
helps
us
be
better
people
it
helps
us
be
better
citizens
you
came
to
college
to
learn
about
the
world
and
to
engage
with
new
ideas
and
to
discover
the
things
passionate
about
and
maybe
have
little
fun
and
to
expand
your
horizons
terrific
huge
part
of
what
college
has
to
offer
but
also
here
now
more
than
ever
because
college
degree
is
the
surest
ticket
to
the
middle
class
it
is
the
key
to
getting
good
job
that
pays
good
income
and
to
provide
you
the
security
where
even
if
you
do
have
the
same
job
for
years
you
so
adaptable
and
you
have
skill
set
and
the
capacity
to
learn
new
skills
it
ensures
you
always
employable
and
that
is
the
key
not
just
for
individual
americans
the
key
for
this
whole
ability
to
compete
in
the
global
economy
in
the
new
economy
jobs
and
businesses
will
go
wherever
the
most
skilled
workforce
resides
because
businesses
are
mobile
now
technology
means
they
can
locate
anywhere
and
where
they
have
the
most
educated
most
adaptable
most
nimble
workforce
that
where
going
to
locate
and
want
them
to
look
no
further
than
the
united
states
of
america
want
them
coming
right
here
want
those
businesses
here
and
want
the
american
people
to
be
able
to
get
those
businesses
or
get
those
jobs
that
those
businesses
create
so
why
increased
grants
and
took
on
student
loan
system
that
was
billions
of
taxpayer
dollars
through
big
banks
and
said
cut
out
the
middleman
give
them
directly
to
students
instead
we
can
help
more
students
increased
scholarships
we
cut
taxes
for
people
paying
tuition
we
let
students
cap
their
federal
student
loan
payments
at
percent
of
income
so
that
they
can
borrow
with
confidence
particularly
if
you
going
into
job
like
nursing
or
teaching
that
may
not
pay
huge
salary
but
that
where
your
passions
are
creating
new
college
ratings
system
that
will
give
parents
and
students
the
kind
of
clear
concise
information
you
need
to
shop
around
for
school
with
the
best
value
for
you
and
gives
us
the
capacity
to
schools
that
offer
great
education
at
reasonable
price
on
the
flight
over
here
and
were
talking
about
how
we
can
do
more
to
simplify
the
application
process
for
federal
student
loans
which
is
still
too
complicated
so
we
done
lot
of
good
work
over
the
last
six
years
we
going
to
keep
at
it
but
today
want
to
focus
on
of
my
education
agenda
and
the
community
colleges
like
this
one
for
millions
of
americans
community
colleges
are
essential
pathways
to
the
middle
class
because
local
flexible
they
work
for
people
who
work
they
work
for
parents
who
have
to
raise
kids
they
work
for
folks
who
have
gone
as
far
as
their
skills
will
take
them
and
want
to
earn
new
ones
but
have
the
capacity
to
just
suddenly
go
study
for
four
years
and
not
work
community
colleges
work
for
veterans
back
into
civilian
life
whether
the
first
in
your
family
to
go
to
college
or
coming
back
to
school
after
many
years
away
community
colleges
find
place
for
you
and
you
can
get
great
education
now
has
been
teaching
english
at
community
colleges
for
years
she
started
when
she
was
like
and
still
today
and
she
sees
talk
to
her
and
she
talks
about
her
students
and
she
can
see
the
excitement
and
the
promise
and
sometimes
the
fear
of
being
mom
going
back
to
school
and
never
finished
the
degree
that
she
had
started
and
life
got
in
the
way
and
now
coming
back
and
suddenly
getting
whole
new
skills
set
and
seeing
whole
range
of
career
options
opening
up
to
her
exciting
and
what
community
colleges
are
all
about
the
idea
that
no
one
with
drive
and
discipline
should
be
left
out
should
be
locked
out
of
opportunity
and
certainly
that
nobody
with
that
drive
and
discipline
should
be
denied
college
education
just
because
they
have
the
money
every
american
whether
young
or
just
young
at
heart
should
be
able
to
earn
the
skills
and
education
necessary
to
compete
and
win
in
the
century
economy
so
today
announcing
an
ambitious
new
plan
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
community
college
tuition
in
america
want
to
bring
it
down
to
zero
going
to
want
to
make
it
free
want
to
make
it
free
community
colleges
should
be
free
for
those
willing
to
work
for
it
because
in
america
quality
education
can
not
be
privilege
that
is
reserved
for
few
think
right
for
everybody
willing
to
work
for
it
now
the
good
news
is
you
already
do
something
like
this
in
you
call
it
promise
so
you
call
it
promise
and
we
thought
why
not
just
build
on
what
works
so
going
to
call
it
college
and
the
concept
is
simple
college
promise
will
make
two
years
of
community
college
free
to
responsible
students
who
are
willing
to
work
for
it
now
want
to
that
last
clause
everybody
working
hard
for
it
there
are
no
free
rides
in
america
you
would
have
to
earn
it
students
would
have
to
do
their
part
by
keeping
their
grades
up
colleges
would
have
to
do
their
part
by
offering
academics
and
helping
students
actually
graduate
states
would
have
to
do
their
part
too
this
blank
check
not
free
lunch
but
for
those
willing
to
do
the
work
and
for
states
and
local
communities
that
want
to
be
part
of
this
it
can
be
think
about
it
students
who
started
at
community
colleges
during
those
two
years
and
then
go
on
to
institution
they
essentially
get
the
first
half
of
their
degree
for
free
people
who
enroll
for
skills
training
will
graduate
already
ready
to
work
and
they
have
pile
of
student
debt
two
years
of
college
will
become
as
free
and
universal
as
high
school
is
today
now
also
taking
another
page
out
of
and
making
investments
to
expand
technical
training
programs
at
community
colleges
much
like
you
do
through
your
colleges
of
applied
technology
did
terrific
job
running
task
force
that
we
put
together
just
to
look
at
the
job
training
and
technical
training
systems
all
around
the
country
and
at
time
when
jobs
are
changing
and
higher
wages
call
for
higher
skills
got
to
make
sure
workers
have
chance
to
get
those
skills
we
want
young
people
to
graduate
with
training
that
leads
directly
to
good
jobs
and
we
want
older
workers
to
get
retrained
so
they
can
compete
and
we
want
more
women
and
minorities
to
get
jobs
in
fields
that
traditionally
been
left
out
of
like
science
and
technology
and
engineering
and
math
and
we
want
to
connect
community
colleges
with
employers
because
when
done
right
these
partnerships
pay
off
for
everybody
students
learn
on
the
job
employers
get
access
to
talent
colleges
get
help
designing
courses
that
actually
prepare
people
for
the
workplace
all
of
which
creates
better
pathways
to
middle
class
so
going
to
find
the
programs
that
work
and
going
to
help
them
grow
now
in
few
weeks
going
to
send
to
congress
my
plan
for
free
community
college
hope
that
congress
will
come
together
to
support
it
because
opening
the
doors
of
higher
education
be
democratic
issue
or
republican
issue
this
is
an
american
issue
governor
is
republican
and
thanks
to
his
leadership
last
year
democrats
and
republicans
came
together
and
made
the
first
state
in
decades
to
offer
free
community
college
to
its
students
meanwhile
up
in
my
of
chicago
mayor
who
is
democrat
is
now
offering
free
community
college
and
pairing
students
with
growing
sectors
of
the
economy
so
they
graduate
with
good
jobs
so
if
state
with
republican
leadership
is
doing
this
and
city
with
democratic
leadership
is
doing
this
then
how
about
we
all
do
it
do
it
for
our
future
and
as
said
before
there
are
bunch
of
good
bipartisan
ideas
out
there
few
days
ago
senator
joined
forces
with
democratic
senator
to
introduce
the
legislation
that
would
make
financial
aid
forms
simpler
noticed
lot
of
people
applauded
because
been
while
since
filled
it
out
but
understand
more
than
questions
on
it
it
just
be
that
hard
to
apply
for
aid
for
college
and
so
committed
to
working
with
senator
shrink
it
down
make
life
little
easier
for
millions
of
families
the
point
is
not
going
to
agree
on
everything
but
simplifying
that
form
something
we
should
be
able
to
agree
on
get
that
done
this
year
because
in
the
end
nothing
is
more
important
to
our
country
than
you
our
people
our
asset
got
very
nice
real
estate
here
got
this
incredible
bounty
the
resources
that
we
enjoy
in
this
country
but
our
greatest
resources
are
people
and
want
to
say
to
the
students
here
and
the
staff
and
faculty
how
proud
am
of
what
you
guys
are
doing
lot
of
students
here
know
you
had
to
overcome
some
obstacles
to
get
here
many
of
you
are
the
first
in
your
families
to
go
to
college
some
of
you
are
working
full
time
while
going
to
school
but
making
this
investment
in
you
and
by
doing
that
making
an
investment
in
this
future
and
just
want
to
use
one
story
as
an
example
where
is
she
is
she
here
thought
she
was
here
second
ago
but
going
to
tell
her
story
anyway
she
was
raised
by
single
mom
she
helped
make
ends
meet
getting
her
first
job
almost
the
minute
she
could
two
days
after
her
birthday
when
it
came
time
for
college
the
money
there
but
lives
in
so
she
knew
she
had
great
free
option
she
completed
two
years
at
this
institution
now
senior
at
college
working
just
like
she
has
since
her
first
day
of
college
and
says
lot
of
people
like
me
got
discouraged
get
discouraged
but
can
look
back
and
say
made
it
so
far
learned
that
things
always
what
you
want
but
you
can
make
them
what
you
wisdom
always
what
you
want
but
you
can
make
them
what
you
what
america
is
about
we
can
make
of
our
lives
what
we
will
and
there
are
going
to
be
bumps
and
there
are
going
to
be
challenges
and
come
through
some
very
hard
times
things
always
what
we
wanted
but
we
have
overcome
discouragement
and
we
have
overcome
division
and
sometimes
some
discord
and
we
give
up
we
get
up
we
fight
back
we
come
back
stronger
than
before
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
the
american
people
the
united
states
of
america
is
coming
back
and
never
been
as
confident
as
in
my
entire
life
that
going
to
make
of
our
future
what
we
want
of
it
thanks
to
you
appreciate
it
god
bless
you
god
bless
america
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
everybody
have
seat
well
thank
you
for
your
introduction
and
go
long
way
back
in
law
school
we
served
on
the
law
review
together
will
not
say
who
edited
who
will
say
she
looks
exactly
the
same
and
do
not
and
it
upsetting
in
your
career
stood
up
for
citizens
and
communities
was
proud
to
nominate
you
first
as
commissioner
and
then
as
chairwoman
of
the
you
are
doing
an
outstanding
job
as
are
your
fellow
commissioners
and
we
very
much
appreciate
your
outstanding
efforts
and
story
from
the
daughter
of
mexican
immigrants
to
the
head
of
the
we
see
central
part
of
the
american
story
and
that
worth
remembering
at
time
when
those
are
issues
that
we
debating
all
the
time
it
reminder
that
what
makes
this
country
special
is
the
incredible
talent
that
we
draw
from
all
around
the
world
and
somehow
it
all
merges
into
something
unique
america
to
to
the
fellow
commissioners
to
all
of
you
who
work
at
the
thanks
for
welcoming
me
told
may
be
the
first
president
to
come
to
the
in
nearly
years
since
in
first
time
apparently
since
in
which
is
little
surprising
mean
think
like
one
of
the
presidents
would
just
come
here
by
accident
they
ended
up
in
the
wrong
building
we
already
at
the
anyway
figured
it
was
time
to
correct
that
plus
know
sometimes
your
name
confuses
folks
they
always
understand
what
your
mission
is
one
person
who
does
understand
is
david
few
months
ago
he
thanked
you
for
standing
up
to
the
companies
that
were
trying
to
pitch
new
product
actually
not
making
this
up
you
ruled
that
these
products
were
substantiated
by
scientific
so
thank
you
for
saving
america
from
undergarments
these
companies
owed
consumers
refund
and
that
was
just
the
latest
example
because
as
said
you
recently
celebrated
your
anniversary
and
want
to
thank
you
for
proud
years
of
protecting
american
consumers
also
want
to
thank
some
of
the
members
of
congress
who
are
here
today
and
many
of
our
partners
from
not
just
government
but
the
private
sector
and
consumer
and
privacy
and
advocacy
groups
next
week
just
up
the
street
will
deliver
the
state
of
the
union
address
and
it
will
be
chance
to
talk
about
resurgence
including
something
we
can
all
be
proud
of
which
is
the
longest
stretch
of
private
sector
job
growth
in
american
history
straight
months
and
more
than
million
new
jobs
in
the
going
to
focus
on
how
we
can
build
on
that
progress
and
help
more
americans
feel
that
resurgence
in
their
own
lives
through
higher
wages
and
rising
incomes
and
growing
middle
class
but
since
only
got
two
years
left
in
this
job
tend
to
be
impatient
and
want
to
wait
for
the
state
of
the
union
to
start
sharing
my
plans
so
been
across
the
country
rolling
out
some
of
the
ideas
that
be
talking
about
little
bit
of
sneak
preview
and
in
the
century
in
this
dizzying
age
of
technology
and
innovation
so
much
of
the
prosperity
that
we
seek
so
many
of
the
jobs
that
we
create
so
much
of
the
opportunity
available
for
the
next
generation
depends
on
our
digital
economy
it
depends
on
our
ability
to
search
and
connect
and
shop
and
do
business
and
create
and
discover
and
learn
in
cyberspace
and
as
all
been
reminded
over
the
past
year
including
the
hack
of
this
extraordinary
interconnection
creates
enormous
opportunities
but
also
creates
enormous
vulnerabilities
for
us
as
nation
and
for
our
economy
and
for
individual
families
so
this
week
laying
out
some
new
proposals
on
how
we
can
keep
seizing
the
possibilities
of
an
information
age
while
protecting
the
security
and
prosperity
and
values
that
we
all
cherish
today
focusing
on
how
we
can
better
protect
american
consumers
from
identity
theft
and
ensure
our
privacy
including
for
our
children
at
school
and
then
tomorrow
at
the
department
of
homeland
security
focus
on
how
we
can
work
with
the
private
sector
to
better
defend
ourselves
against
and
final
on
in
talk
about
how
we
can
give
families
and
communities
faster
cheaper
access
to
broadband
so
they
can
succeed
in
the
digital
economy
but
wanted
to
start
here
at
the
because
every
day
you
take
the
lead
in
making
sure
that
americans
their
money
and
their
privacy
are
protected
especially
when
they
go
and
these
days
pretty
much
for
everything
managing
our
bank
accounts
paying
our
bills
handling
everything
from
medical
records
to
movie
tickets
controlling
our
homes
smart
houses
from
smart
phones
secret
service
does
not
let
me
do
that
but
know
other
people
do
and
with
these
benefits
come
risks
major
companies
get
hacked
personal
information
including
financial
information
gets
stolen
and
the
problem
is
growing
and
it
costs
us
billions
of
dollars
in
one
survey
out
of
americans
say
they
feel
like
lost
control
of
their
personal
information
in
recent
breaches
more
than
million
americans
have
had
their
personal
data
compromised
like
credit
card
information
when
these
criminals
start
racking
up
charges
on
your
card
it
can
destroy
your
credit
rating
it
can
turn
your
life
upside
down
it
may
take
you
months
to
get
your
finances
back
in
order
so
this
is
direct
threat
to
the
economic
security
of
american
families
and
got
to
stop
it
if
going
to
be
connected
then
we
need
to
be
protected
as
americans
we
have
to
forfeit
our
basic
privacy
when
we
go
to
do
our
business
and
why
since
took
office
been
working
with
the
private
sector
to
strengthen
our
defenses
few
months
ago
we
launched
our
initiative
the
federal
government
and
companies
across
the
country
are
moving
to
stronger
technology
for
credit
cards
here
at
the
working
with
credit
bureaus
so
that
victims
can
recover
their
stolen
identities
faster
and
every
day
helping
consumers
with
so
today
announcing
new
steps
to
protect
the
identities
and
privacy
of
the
american
people
let
me
list
them
for
you
first
introducing
new
legislation
to
create
single
strong
national
standard
so
americans
know
when
their
information
has
been
stolen
or
misused
right
now
almost
every
state
has
different
law
on
this
and
confusing
for
consumers
and
confusing
for
companies
and
costly
too
to
have
to
comply
to
this
patchwork
of
laws
sometimes
folks
even
find
out
their
credit
card
information
has
been
stolen
until
they
see
charges
on
their
bill
and
then
too
late
so
under
the
new
standard
that
proposing
companies
would
have
to
notify
consumers
of
breach
within
days
in
addition
proposing
to
close
loopholes
in
the
law
so
we
can
go
after
more
criminals
who
steal
and
sell
the
identities
of
americans
even
when
they
do
it
overseas
second
pleased
that
more
banks
credit
card
issuers
and
lenders
are
stepping
up
and
equipping
americans
with
another
weapon
against
identity
theft
and
access
to
their
credit
scores
free
of
charge
this
includes
chase
bank
of
america
state
credit
union
ally
financial
some
of
them
are
here
today
want
to
thank
them
for
their
participation
this
means
that
majority
of
american
adults
will
have
free
access
to
their
credit
score
which
is
like
an
early
warning
system
telling
you
that
been
hit
by
fraud
so
you
can
deal
with
it
fast
and
encouraging
more
companies
to
join
this
effort
every
day
third
going
to
be
introducing
new
legislation
consumer
privacy
bill
of
rights
working
with
many
of
you
from
the
private
sector
and
advocacy
groups
identified
some
basic
principles
to
both
protect
personal
privacy
and
ensure
that
industry
can
keep
innovating
for
example
we
believe
that
consumers
have
the
right
to
decide
what
personal
data
companies
collect
from
them
and
how
companies
use
that
data
that
information
the
right
to
know
that
your
personal
information
collected
for
one
purpose
then
be
misused
by
company
for
different
purpose
the
right
to
have
your
information
stored
securely
by
companies
that
are
accountable
for
its
use
we
believe
that
there
ought
to
be
some
basic
baseline
protections
across
industries
so
we
going
to
be
introducing
this
legislation
by
the
end
of
next
month
and
hope
congress
joins
us
to
make
the
consumer
privacy
bill
of
rights
the
law
of
the
land
and
finally
taking
series
of
actions
to
protect
the
personal
information
and
privacy
of
our
children
those
of
us
with
kids
know
how
hard
this
can
be
whether
they
are
or
or
on
or
or
vine
our
children
are
meeting
up
and
they
are
growing
up
in
cyberspace
it
is
and
here
at
the
pushed
back
on
companies
and
that
collect
information
on
our
kids
without
permission
and
and
are
like
parents
everywhere
we
want
to
make
sure
that
our
children
are
being
smart
and
safe
that
responsibility
of
ours
as
parents
but
we
need
partners
and
we
need
structure
that
ensures
that
information
is
not
being
gathered
without
us
as
parents
or
the
kids
knowing
it
we
want
our
privacy
protected
wherever
they
sign
in
or
log
on
including
at
school
now
the
good
news
is
got
new
educational
technologies
that
are
transforming
how
our
children
learn
you
got
innovative
and
and
tablets
digital
textbooks
and
tutors
students
are
getting
lessons
tailored
to
their
unique
learning
needs
we
want
to
encourage
that
information
and
it
also
facilitates
teachers
and
parents
tracking
student
progress
and
grades
in
and
all
this
is
part
of
what
our
connected
initiative
is
about
connecting
percent
of
american
students
to
internet
so
that
empowering
students
teachers
and
parents
and
giving
them
access
to
worlds
they
may
never
have
had
access
to
before
but
already
seen
some
instances
where
some
companies
use
educational
technologies
to
collect
student
data
for
commercial
purposes
like
targeted
advertising
and
parents
have
legitimate
concern
about
those
kinds
of
practices
so
today
proposing
the
student
digital
privacy
act
that
pretty
straightforward
saying
that
data
collected
on
students
in
the
classroom
should
only
be
used
for
educational
purposes
to
teach
our
children
not
to
market
to
our
children
we
want
to
prevent
companies
from
selling
student
data
to
third
parties
for
purposes
other
than
education
we
want
to
prevent
any
kind
of
profiling
that
outs
certain
students
at
disadvantage
as
they
go
through
school
and
we
believe
that
this
just
give
parents
more
peace
of
mind
we
confident
that
it
will
make
sure
the
tools
we
use
in
the
classroom
will
actually
support
the
breakthrough
research
and
innovations
that
we
need
to
keep
unlocking
new
educational
technologies
now
we
did
have
to
completely
reinvent
the
wheel
on
this
proposal
many
states
have
proposed
similar
legislation
california
just
passed
landmark
law
and
hope
congress
joins
us
in
this
national
movement
to
protect
the
privacy
of
our
children
we
wait
for
legislation
though
the
department
of
education
is
going
to
offer
new
tools
to
help
schools
and
teachers
work
with
tech
companies
to
protect
the
privacy
of
students
as
of
today
companies
across
the
country
have
signed
on
to
student
privacy
pledge
and
among
other
things
committing
not
to
sell
student
information
or
use
educational
technologies
to
engage
in
targeted
advertising
to
students
some
of
those
companies
are
here
today
we
want
to
thank
you
for
your
leadership
want
to
encourage
every
company
that
provides
these
technologies
to
our
schools
to
join
this
effort
the
right
thing
to
do
and
if
you
join
this
effort
then
we
intend
to
make
sure
that
those
schools
and
those
parents
know
you
joined
this
effort
so
this
mission
protecting
our
information
and
privacy
in
the
information
age
this
should
not
be
partisan
issue
this
should
be
something
that
unites
all
of
us
as
americans
one
of
those
new
challenges
in
our
modern
society
that
crosses
the
old
divides
transcends
politics
transcends
ideology
liberal
conservative
democrat
republican
everybody
is
and
everybody
understands
the
risks
and
vulnerabilities
as
well
as
opportunities
that
are
presented
by
this
new
world
business
leaders
want
their
privacy
and
their
privacy
protected
just
like
everybody
else
does
consumer
and
privacy
advocates
also
want
to
make
sure
that
america
keeps
leading
the
world
in
technology
and
innovation
and
so
there
are
some
basic
pragmatic
steps
that
we
ought
to
all
be
able
to
support
and
rather
than
being
at
odds
think
that
much
of
this
work
actually
reinforces
each
other
the
more
we
do
to
protect
consumer
information
and
privacy
the
harder
it
is
for
hackers
to
damage
our
businesses
and
hurt
our
economy
meanwhile
the
more
companies
strengthen
their
the
harder
it
is
for
hackers
to
steal
consumer
information
and
hurt
american
families
so
got
to
all
be
working
together
in
the
same
direction
and
confident
if
we
do
be
making
progress
we
are
the
country
that
invented
the
internet
and
also
the
pioneers
of
this
information
age
the
creators
the
designers
the
innovators
our
children
are
leaving
us
in
the
dust
if
you
noticed
connecting
and
collaborating
like
never
before
and
imagining
future
we
can
only
dream
of
when
we
americans
put
our
minds
together
and
our
shoulder
to
the
wheel
nothing
we
do
so
confident
if
we
keep
at
this
we
can
deliver
the
prosperity
and
security
and
privacy
that
all
americans
deserve
we
pioneered
the
internet
but
we
also
pioneered
the
bill
of
rights
and
sense
that
each
of
us
as
individuals
have
sphere
of
privacy
around
us
that
should
not
be
breached
whether
by
our
government
but
also
by
commercial
interests
and
since
pioneers
in
both
these
areas
confident
that
we
can
be
pioneers
in
crafting
the
kind
of
architecture
that
will
allow
us
to
both
grow
innovate
and
preserve
those
values
that
are
so
precious
to
us
as
americans
thank
you
very
much
and
thanks
to
the
for
all
the
great
work
you
do
to
protect
the
american
people
thank
you
good
afternoon
everybody
want
to
thank
secretary
deputy
secretary
and
the
dedicated
public
servants
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
for
welcoming
me
here
today
kind
of
taken
over
your
work
space
for
that
but
just
pretend
that
not
here
want
you
to
keep
working
did
ask
who
dressed
up
for
this
event
and
apparently
few
were
brave
enough
to
admit
it
but
in
advance
of
my
state
of
the
union
address
next
week
been
rolling
out
my
proposals
for
keeping
our
economy
on
track
keeping
it
growing
making
sure
we
creating
jobs
and
opportunity
for
the
american
people
and
that
includes
the
extraordinary
opportunities
that
exist
in
our
digital
economy
yesterday
announced
new
proposals
to
better
protect
americans
from
identity
theft
and
to
ensure
our
privacy
including
making
sure
that
our
kids
are
safe
from
digital
marketing
and
intrusions
on
their
privacy
based
on
what
doing
at
school
tomorrow
in
talk
about
how
we
can
give
more
families
and
communities
faster
cheaper
access
to
the
broadband
that
allows
them
to
successfully
compete
in
this
global
economy
and
on
thursday
the
vice
president
will
be
in
to
highlight
the
need
to
continue
to
invest
in
the
education
and
skills
for
our
professionals
but
today
am
here
at
to
highlight
how
we
can
work
with
the
private
sector
to
better
protect
american
companies
against
threats
shortly
after
took
office
declared
that
threats
pose
an
enormous
challenge
for
our
country
it
one
of
the
most
serious
economic
and
national
security
challenges
we
face
as
nation
foreign
governments
criminals
and
hackers
probe
computer
networks
every
single
day
we
saw
that
again
with
the
attack
at
which
actually
destroyed
data
and
computer
hardware
that
is
going
to
be
very
costly
for
that
company
to
clean
up
just
yesterday
we
saw
the
hack
of
military
twitter
account
and
you
tube
channel
no
military
operations
were
impacted
so
far
it
appears
that
no
classified
information
was
released
but
the
investigation
is
ongoing
and
reminder
that
threats
are
an
urgent
and
growing
danger
moreover
much
of
our
critical
infrastructure
our
financial
systems
power
grids
pipelines
health
care
systems
run
on
networks
connected
to
the
internet
so
this
is
matter
of
public
safety
and
of
public
health
and
most
of
this
infrastructure
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
private
sector
so
neither
government
nor
the
private
sector
can
defend
the
nation
alone
going
to
have
to
be
shared
mission
government
and
industry
working
hand
in
hand
as
partners
and
why
said
that
protecting
our
digital
infrastructure
is
national
security
priority
and
national
economic
priority
over
the
past
six
years
pursued
comprehensive
strategy
boosting
our
defenses
in
government
sharing
more
information
with
the
private
sector
to
help
them
defend
themselves
working
with
industry
through
what
we
call
the
framework
not
just
to
respond
to
threats
and
recover
from
attacks
but
to
prevent
and
disrupt
them
in
the
first
place
and
where
these
good
folks
come
in
we
are
currently
at
the
national
communications
integration
also
known
as
just
got
tour
and
briefing
want
to
thank
everybody
here
not
just
from
but
from
across
government
and
the
private
sector
because
again
this
is
shared
responsibility
this
is
one
of
the
critical
lines
of
defenses
these
men
and
women
work
around
the
clock
monitoring
threats
issuing
warnings
sharing
information
with
the
private
sector
and
keeping
americans
safe
so
as
nation
we
owe
them
thanks
and
as
nation
we
are
making
progress
more
prepared
to
defend
against
attacks
but
every
day
our
adversaries
are
getting
more
sophisticated
and
more
determined
and
more
plentiful
so
every
day
got
to
keep
our
game
at
the
same
time
got
to
stay
ahead
of
those
who
are
trying
to
do
us
harm
the
problem
is
that
government
and
the
private
sector
are
still
not
always
working
as
closely
together
as
we
should
sometimes
still
too
hard
for
government
to
share
threat
information
with
companies
sometimes
still
too
hard
for
companies
to
share
information
about
threats
with
the
government
there
are
legal
issues
involved
and
liability
issues
sometimes
companies
are
reluctant
to
reveal
their
vulnerabilities
or
admit
publicly
that
they
have
been
hacked
at
the
same
time
the
american
people
have
legitimate
interest
in
making
sure
that
government
is
not
potentially
abusing
information
that
it
received
from
the
private
sector
so
all
of
us
government
and
industry
are
going
to
have
to
keep
doing
better
the
new
legislation
and
proposals
put
forward
yesterday
will
help
especially
for
strong
single
national
standard
for
notifying
americans
when
their
information
has
been
breached
today
want
to
announce
some
additional
steps
first
proposing
new
legislation
to
promote
the
greater
information
sharing
we
need
between
government
and
the
private
sector
this
builds
and
improves
upon
legislation
that
put
forward
in
the
past
it
reflects
years
of
extensive
discussions
with
industry
it
includes
liability
protections
for
companies
that
share
information
on
threats
it
includes
essential
safeguards
to
ensure
that
government
protects
privacy
and
civil
liberties
even
as
we
doing
our
job
of
safeguarding
critical
information
networks
raised
this
issue
again
and
the
need
for
this
legislation
with
congressional
leaders
this
morning
including
speaker
and
leader
and
we
all
agree
that
this
is
threat
that
has
to
be
addressed
and
am
confident
that
we
should
be
able
to
craft
bipartisan
legislation
soon
to
put
these
systems
in
place
going
to
keep
on
working
with
congress
to
get
this
done
and
in
the
meantime
going
to
do
everything
we
can
with
our
existing
authorities
to
make
sure
industry
gets
the
information
it
needs
to
better
defend
itself
second
proposing
to
update
the
authorities
that
law
enforcement
uses
to
go
after
criminals
we
want
to
be
able
to
better
prosecute
those
who
are
involved
in
attacks
those
who
are
involved
in
the
sale
of
weapons
like
and
we
want
to
ensure
that
able
to
prosecute
insiders
who
steal
corporate
secrets
or
private
information
and
we
want
to
expand
the
authority
of
courts
to
shut
down
and
other
the
bottom
line
we
want
criminals
to
feel
the
full
force
of
american
justice
because
they
are
doing
as
much
damage
if
not
more
these
days
as
folks
who
are
involved
in
more
conventional
crime
finally
and
since
this
is
challenge
that
we
can
only
meet
together
announcing
that
next
month
convene
white
house
summit
on
and
consumer
protection
white
house
summit
where
we
not
going
to
do
it
at
the
white
house
we
going
to
go
to
university
and
going
to
bring
everybody
together
industry
tech
companies
law
enforcement
consumer
and
privacy
advocates
law
professors
who
are
specialists
in
the
field
as
well
as
students
to
make
sure
that
we
work
through
these
issues
in
public
transparent
fashion
because
hard
and
complicated
issues
but
if
we
keep
on
working
on
them
together
and
focus
on
concrete
and
pragmatic
steps
that
we
can
take
to
boost
our
and
our
privacy
confident
that
both
our
privacy
will
be
more
secure
and
our
information
our
networks
public
health
public
safety
will
be
more
secure
going
to
keep
on
at
this
as
government
but
we
also
going
to
be
working
with
the
private
sector
to
detect
prevent
defend
deter
against
attacks
and
to
recover
quickly
from
any
disruptions
or
damage
and
as
long
as
president
protecting
digital
infrastructure
is
going
to
remain
top
national
security
priority
in
closing
want
to
say
one
of
the
areas
be
working
with
congress
is
to
ensure
that
we
let
any
disagreements
keep
us
from
fulfilling
our
most
basic
responsibilities
last
attack
in
paris
was
painful
reminder
that
we
have
no
greater
duty
than
the
security
of
the
american
people
and
our
national
security
should
never
be
subject
to
partisan
political
games
congress
needs
to
fully
fund
our
department
of
homeland
security
without
delay
so
that
the
dedicated
public
servants
working
here
can
operate
with
the
certainty
and
confidence
they
need
to
keep
the
american
people
safe
and
that
true
across
the
board
in
the
department
of
homeland
security
so
again
want
to
thank
and
deputy
secretary
and
everybody
here
at
and
for
the
great
job
you
are
doing
you
are
helping
to
keep
the
nation
safe
and
secure
and
with
that
we
going
to
get
out
of

can
get
back
to
work
who
knows
been
happening
while
been
paying
attention
to
me
all
right
thank
you
very
much
everybody
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
my
fellow
americans
we
are
years
into
this
new
century
fifteen
years
that
dawned
with
terror
touching
our
shores
that
unfolded
with
new
generation
fighting
two
long
and
costly
wars
that
saw
vicious
recession
spread
across
our
nation
and
the
world
it
has
been
and
still
is
hard
time
for
many
but
tonight
we
turn
the
page
tonight
after
breakthrough
year
for
america
our
economy
is
growing
and
creating
jobs
at
the
fastest
pace
since
our
unemployment
rate
is
now
lower
than
it
was
before
the
financial
crisis
more
of
our
kids
are
graduating
than
ever
before
more
of
our
people
are
insured
than
ever
before
and
we
are
as
free
from
the
grip
of
foreign
oil
as
been
in
almost
years
tonight
for
the
first
time
since
our
combat
mission
in
is
over
six
years
ago
nearly
american
troops
served
in
iraq
and
today
fewer
than
remain
and
we
salute
the
courage
and
sacrifice
of
every
man
and
woman
in
this
generation
who
has
served
to
keep
us
safe
we
are
humbled
and
grateful
for
your
service
america
for
all
that
we
have
endured
for
all
the
grit
and
hard
work
required
to
come
back
for
all
the
tasks
that
lie
ahead
know
this
the
shadow
of
crisis
has
passed
and
the
state
of
the
union
is
strong
at
this
moment
with
growing
economy
shrinking
deficits
bustling
industry
booming
energy
production
we
have
risen
from
recession
freer
to
write
our
own
future
than
any
other
nation
on
earth
now
up
to
us
to
choose
who
we
want
to
be
over
the
next
years
and
for
decades
to
come
will
we
accept
an
economy
where
only
few
of
us
do
spectacularly
well
or
will
we
commit
ourselves
to
an
economy
that
generates
rising
incomes
and
chances
for
everyone
who
makes
the
effort
will
we
approach
the
world
fearful
and
reactive
dragged
into
costly
conflicts
that
strain
our
military
and
set
back
our
standing
or
will
we
lead
wisely
using
all
elements
of
our
power
to
defeat
new
threats
and
protect
our
planet
will
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
sorted
into
factions
and
turned
against
one
another
or
will
we
recapture
the
sense
of
common
purpose
that
has
always
propelled
america
forward
in
two
weeks
will
send
this
congress
budget
filled
with
ideas
that
are
practical
not
partisan
and
in
the
months
ahead
the
country
making
case
for
those
ideas
so
tonight
want
to
focus
less
on
checklist
of
proposals
and
focus
more
on
the
values
at
stake
in
the
choices
before
us
it
begins
with
our
economy
seven
years
ago
and
ben
of
were
newlyweds
she
waited
tables
he
worked
construction
their
first
child
jack
was
on
the
way
they
were
young
and
in
love
in
america
and
it
get
much
better
than
that
only
we
had
known
wrote
to
me
last
spring
was
about
to
happen
to
the
housing
and
construction
as
the
crisis
worsened
business
dried
up
so
he
took
what
jobs
he
could
find
even
if
they
kept
him
on
the
road
for
long
stretches
of
time
took
out
student
loans
and
enrolled
in
community
college
and
retrained
for
new
career
they
sacrificed
for
each
other
and
slowly
it
paid
off
they
bought
their
first
home
they
had
second
son
henry
got
better
job
and
then
raise
ben
is
back
in
construction
and
home
for
dinner
every
night
is
amazing
wrote
you
can
bounce
back
from
when
you
have
are
strong
family
who
has
made
it
through
some
very
very
hard
we
are
strong
family
who
has
made
it
through
some
very
very
hard
times
america
and
story
is
our
story
they
represent
the
millions
who
have
worked
hard
and
scrimped
and
sacrificed
and
you
are
the
reason
that
ran
for
this
office
you
are
the
people
was
thinking
of
six
years
ago
today
in
the
darkest
months
of
the
crisis
when
stood
on
the
steps
of
this
capitol
and
promised
we
would
rebuild
our
economy
on
new
foundation
and
it
has
been
your
resilience
your
effort
that
has
made
it
possible
for
our
country
to
emerge
stronger
we
believed
we
could
reverse
the
tide
of
outsourcing
and
draw
new
jobs
to
our
shores
and
over
the
past
five
years
our
businesses
have
created
more
than
million
new
jobs
we
believed
we
could
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
protect
our
planet
and
today
america
is
number
one
in
oil
and
gas
america
is
number
one
in
wind
power
every
three
weeks
we
bring
as
much
solar
power
as
we
did
in
all
of
and
thanks
to
lower
gas
prices
and
higher
fuel
standards
the
typical
family
this
year
should
save
about
at
the
pump
we
believed
we
could
prepare
our
kids
for
more
competitive
world
and
today
our
younger
students
have
earned
the
highest
math
and
reading
scores
on
record
our
high
school
graduation
rate
has
hit
an
high
more
americans
finish
college
than
ever
before
we
believed
that
sensible
regulations
could
prevent
another
crisis
shield
families
from
ruin
and
encourage
fair
competition
today
we
have
new
tools
to
stop
and
new
consumer
watchdog
to
protect
us
from
predatory
lending
and
abusive
credit
card
practices
and
in
the
past
year
alone
about
million
uninsured
americans
finally
gained
the
security
of
health
coverage
at
every
step
we
were
told
our
goals
were
misguided
or
too
ambitious
that
we
would
crush
jobs
and
explode
deficits
instead
seen
the
fastest
economic
growth
in
over
decade
our
deficits
cut
by
stock
market
that
has
doubled
and
health
care
inflation
at
its
lowest
rate
in
years
this
is
good
news
people
so
the
verdict
is
clear
economics
works
expanding
opportunity
works
and
these
policies
will
continue
to
work
as
long
as
politics
get
in
the
way
we
slow
down
businesses
or
put
our
economy
at
risk
with
government
shutdowns
or
fiscal
we
put
the
security
of
families
at
risk
by
taking
away
their
health
insurance
or
the
new
rules
on
wall
street
or
past
battles
on
immigration
when
got
to
fix
broken
system
and
if
bill
comes
to
my
desk
that
tries
to
do
any
of
these
things
will
veto
it
it
will
have
earned
my
veto
today
thanks
to
growing
economy
the
recovery
is
touching
more
and
more
lives
wages
are
finally
starting
to
rise
again
we
know
that
more
small
business
owners
plan
to
raise
their
pay
than
at
any
time
since
but
the
thing
those
of
us
here
tonight
we
need
to
set
our
sights
higher
than
just
making
sure
government
screw
things
up
that
government
halt
the
progress
making
we
need
to
do
more
than
just
do
no
harm
tonight
together
do
more
to
restore
the
link
between
hard
work
and
growing
opportunity
for
every
american
because
families
like
still
need
our
help
she
and
ben
are
working
as
hard
as
ever
but
had
to
forego
vacations
and
new
car
so
that
they
can
pay
off
student
loans
and
save
for
retirement
friday
night
pizza
big
splurge
basic
childcare
for
jack
and
henry
costs
more
than
their
mortgage
and
almost
as
much
as
year
at
the
university
of
like
millions
of
hardworking
americans
asking
for
handout
but
she
is
asking
that
we
look
for
more
ways
to
help
families
get
ahead
and
in
fact
at
every
moment
of
economic
change
throughout
our
history
this
country
has
taken
bold
action
to
adapt
to
new
circumstances
and
to
make
sure
everyone
gets
fair
shot
we
set
up
worker
protections
social
security
to
protect
ourselves
from
the
harshest
adversity
we
gave
our
citizens
schools
and
colleges
infrastructure
and
the
internet
tools
they
needed
to
go
as
far
as
their
effort
and
their
dreams
will
take
them
what
economics
is
the
idea
that
this
country
does
best
when
everyone
gets
their
fair
shot
everyone
does
their
fair
share
everyone
plays
by
the
same
set
of
rules
we
just
want
everyone
to
share
in
success
we
want
everyone
to
contribute
to
our
success
so
what
does
economics
require
in
our
time
first
economics
means
helping
working
families
feel
more
secure
in
world
of
constant
change
that
means
helping
folks
afford
childcare
college
health
care
home
retirement
and
my
budget
will
address
each
of
these
issues
lowering
the
taxes
of
working
families
and
putting
thousands
of
dollars
back
into
their
pockets
each
year
one
example
during
world
war
when
men
like
my
grandfather
went
off
to
war
having
women
like
my
grandmother
in
the
workforce
was
national
security
priority
so
this
country
provided
universal
childcare
in
economy
when
having
both
parents
in
the
workforce
is
an
economic
necessity
for
many
families
we
need
affordable
childcare
more
than
ever
not
so
time
we
stop
treating
childcare
as
side
issue
or
as
issue
and
treat
it
like
the
national
economic
priority
that
it
is
for
all
of
us
and
why
my
plan
will
make
quality
childcare
more
available
and
more
affordable
for
every
and
family
with
young
children
in
america
by
creating
more
slots
and
new
tax
cut
of
up
to
per
child
per
year
another
example
today
we
are
the
only
advanced
country
on
earth
that
guarantee
paid
sick
leave
or
paid
maternity
leave
to
our
workers
million
workers
have
no
paid
sick
leave
million
think
about
that
and
that
forces
too
many
parents
to
make
the
choice
between
and
sick
kid
at
home
so
be
taking
new
action
to
help
states
adopt
paid
leave
laws
of
their
own
and
since
paid
sick
leave
won
where
it
was
on
the
ballot
last
november
put
it
to
vote
right
here
in
washington
send
me
bill
that
gives
every
worker
in
america
the
opportunity
to
earn
seven
days
of
paid
sick
leave
the
right
thing
to
do
the
right
thing
to
do
of
course
nothing
helps
families
make
ends
meet
like
higher
wages
why
this
congress
still
needs
to
pass
law
that
makes
sure
woman
is
paid
the
same
as
man
for
doing
the
same
work
time
we
still
need
to
make
sure
employees
get
the
overtime
earned
and
to
everyone
in
this
congress
who
still
refuses
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
say
this
if
you
truly
believe
you
could
work
and
support
family
on
less
than
year
try
it
if
not
vote
to
give
millions
of
the
people
in
america
raise
now
these
ideas
make
everybody
rich
relieve
every
hardship
not
the
job
of
government
to
give
working
families
fair
shot
we
still
need
more
employers
to
see
beyond
next
earnings
and
that
investing
in
their
workforce
is
in
their
interest
we
still
need
laws
that
strengthen
rather
than
weaken
unions
and
give
american
workers
voice
but
you
know
things
like
childcare
and
sick
leave
and
equal
pay
things
like
lower
mortgage
premiums
and
higher
minimum
wage
these
ideas
will
make
meaningful
difference
in
the
lives
of
millions
of
families
fact
and
what
all
of
us
republicans
and
democrats
alike
were
sent
here
to
do
second
to
make
sure
folks
keep
earning
higher
wages
down
the
road
we
have
to
do
more
to
help
americans
upgrade
their
skills
america
thrived
in
the
century
because
we
made
high
school
free
sent
generation
of
to
college
trained
the
best
workforce
in
the
world
we
were
ahead
of
the
curve
but
other
countries
caught
on
and
in
century
economy
that
rewards
knowledge
like
never
before
we
need
to
up
our
game
we
need
to
do
more
by
the
end
of
this
decade
two
in
three
job
openings
will
require
some
higher
education
two
in
three
and
yet
we
still
live
in
country
where
too
many
bright
striving
americans
are
priced
out
of
the
education
they
need
not
fair
to
them
and
sure
not
smart
for
our
future
why
sending
this
congress
bold
new
plan
to
lower
the
cost
of
community
college
to
zero
keep
in
mind
percent
of
our
college
students
choose
community
college
some
are
young
and
starting
out
some
are
older
and
looking
for
better
job
some
are
veterans
and
single
parents
trying
to
transition
back
into
the
job
market
whoever
you
are
this
plan
is
your
chance
to
graduate
ready
for
the
new
economy
without
load
of
debt
understand
got
to
earn
it
got
to
keep
your
grades
up
and
graduate
on
time
state
with
republican
leadership
and
chicago
city
with
democratic
leadership
are
showing
that
free
community
college
is
possible
want
to
spread
that
idea
all
across
america
so
that
two
years
of
college
becomes
as
free
and
universal
in
america
as
high
school
is
today
stay
ahead
of
the
curve
and
want
to
work
with
this
congress
to
make
sure
those
already
burdened
with
student
loans
can
reduce
their
monthly
payments
so
that
student
debt
derail
dreams
thanks
to
vice
president
great
work
to
update
our
job
training
system
connecting
community
colleges
with
local
employers
to
train
workers
to
fill
jobs
like
coding
and
nursing
and
robotics
tonight
also
asking
more
businesses
to
follow
the
lead
of
companies
like
and
ups
and
offer
more
educational
benefits
and
paid
apprenticeships
opportunities
that
give
workers
the
chance
to
earn
jobs
even
if
they
have
higher
education
and
as
new
generation
of
veterans
comes
home
we
owe
them
every
opportunity
to
live
the
american
dream
they
helped
defend
already
made
strides
towards
ensuring
that
every
veteran
has
access
to
the
highest
quality
care
slashing
the
backlog
that
had
too
many
veterans
waiting
years
to
get
the
benefits
they
need
and
making
it
easier
for
vets
to
translate
their
training
and
experience
into
civilian
jobs
and
joining
forces
the
national
campaign
launched
by
and
thank
you
thank
you
has
helped
nearly
veterans
and
military
spouses
get
new
job
so
to
every
in
america
let
me
repeat
if
you
want
somebody
going
to
get
the
job
done
and
done
right
hire
veteran
finally
as
we
better
train
our
workers
we
need
the
new
economy
to
keep
churning
out
jobs
for
our
workers
to
fill
since
america
has
put
more
people
back
to
work
than
europe
japan
and
all
advanced
economies
combined
our
manufacturers
have
added
almost
new
jobs
some
of
our
bedrock
sectors
like
our
auto
industry
are
booming
but
there
are
also
millions
of
americans
who
work
in
jobs
that
even
exist
or
years
ago
jobs
at
companies
like
and
and
so
no
one
knows
for
certain
which
industries
will
generate
the
jobs
of
the
future
but
we
do
know
we
want
them
here
in
america
we
know
that
and
why
the
third
part
of
economics
is
all
about
building
the
most
competitive
economy
anywhere
the
place
where
businesses
want
to
locate
and
hire
century
businesses
need
century
infrastructure
modern
ports
and
stronger
bridges
faster
trains
and
the
fastest
internet
democrats
and
republicans
used
to
agree
on
this
so
set
our
sights
higher
than
single
oil
pipeline
pass
bipartisan
infrastructure
plan
that
could
create
more
than
times
as
many
jobs
per
year
and
make
this
country
stronger
for
decades
to
come
do
it
get
it
done
get
it
done
century
businesses
including
small
businesses
need
to
sell
more
american
products
overseas
today
our
businesses
export
more
than
ever
and
exporters
tend
to
pay
their
workers
higher
wages
but
as
we
speak
china
wants
to
write
the
rules
for
the
region
that
would
put
our
workers
and
our
businesses
at
disadvantage
why
would
we
let
that
happen
we
should
write
those
rules
we
should
level
the
playing
field
why
asking
both
parties
to
give
me
trade
promotion
authority
to
protect
american
workers
with
strong
new
trade
deals
from
asia
to
europe
that
just
free
but
are
also
fair
the
right
thing
to
do
look
the
first
one
to
admit
that
past
trade
deals
always
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
why
gone
after
countries
that
break
the
rules
at
our
expense
but
percent
of
the
customers
live
outside
our
borders
we
close
ourselves
off
from
those
opportunities
more
than
half
of
manufacturing
executives
have
said
actively
looking
to
bring
jobs
back
from
china
so
give
them
one
more
reason
to
get
it
done
century
businesses
will
rely
on
american
science
and
technology
research
and
development
want
the
country
that
eliminated
polio
and
mapped
the
human
genome
to
lead
new
era
of
medicine
one
that
delivers
the
right
treatment
at
the
right
time
in
some
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
this
approach
has
reversed
disease
once
thought
unstoppable
so
tonight
launching
new
precision
medicine
initiative
to
bring
us
closer
to
curing
diseases
like
cancer
and
diabetes
and
to
give
all
of
us
access
to
the
information
we
need
to
keep
ourselves
and
our
families
healthier
we
can
do
this
intend
to
protect
free
and
open
internet
extend
its
reach
to
every
classroom
and
every
community
and
help
folks
build
the
fastest
networks
so
that
the
next
generation
of
digital
innovators
and
entrepreneurs
have
the
platform
to
keep
reshaping
our
world
want
americans
to
win
the
race
for
the
kinds
of
discoveries
that
unleash
new
jobs
converting
sunlight
into
liquid
fuel
creating
revolutionary
so
that
veteran
who
gave
his
arms
for
his
country
can
play
catch
with
his
kids
again
pushing
out
into
the
solar
system
not
just
to
visit
but
to
stay
last
month
we
launched
new
spacecraft
as
part
of
space
program
that
will
send
american
astronauts
to
mars
and
in
two
months
to
prepare
us
for
those
missions
will
begin
stay
in
space
so
good
luck
captain
make
sure
to
it
proud
of
you
now
the
truth
is
when
it
comes
to
issues
like
infrastructure
and
basic
research
know
bipartisan
support
in
this
chamber
members
of
both
parties
have
told
me
so
where
we
too
often
run
onto
the
rocks
is
how
to
pay
for
these
investments
as
americans
we
mind
paying
our
fair
share
of
taxes
as
long
as
everybody
else
does
too
but
for
far
too
long
lobbyists
have
rigged
the
tax
code
with
loopholes
that
let
some
corporations
pay
nothing
while
others
pay
full
freight
riddled
it
with
that
the
need
while
denying
break
to
families
who
do
this
year
we
have
an
opportunity
to
change
that
close
loopholes
so
we
stop
rewarding
companies
that
keep
profits
abroad
and
reward
those
that
invest
here
in
america
use
those
savings
to
rebuild
our
infrastructure
and
to
make
it
more
attractive
for
companies
to
bring
jobs
home
simplify
the
system
and
let
small
business
owner
file
based
on
her
actual
bank
statement
instead
of
the
number
of
accountants
she
can
afford
and
close
the
loopholes
that
lead
to
inequality
by
allowing
the
top
one
percent
to
avoid
paying
taxes
on
their
accumulated
wealth
we
can
use
that
money
to
help
more
families
pay
for
childcare
and
send
their
kids
to
college
we
need
tax
code
that
truly
helps
working
americans
trying
to
get
leg
up
in
the
new
economy
and
we
can
achieve
that
together
we
can
achieve
it
together
helping
hardworking
families
make
ends
meet
giving
them
the
tools
they
need
for
jobs
in
this
new
economy
maintaining
the
conditions
of
growth
and
competitiveness
this
is
where
america
needs
to
go
believe
where
the
american
people
want
to
go
it
will
make
our
economy
stronger
year
from
now
years
from
now
and
deep
into
the
century
ahead
of
course
if
one
thing
this
new
century
has
taught
us
that
we
can
not
separate
our
work
here
at
home
from
challenges
beyond
our
shores
my
first
duty
as
is
to
defend
the
united
states
of
america
in
doing
so
the
question
is
not
whether
america
leads
in
the
world
but
how
when
we
make
rash
decisions
reacting
to
the
headlines
instead
of
using
our
heads
when
the
first
response
to
challenge
is
to
send
in
our
military
then
we
risk
getting
drawn
into
unnecessary
conflicts
and
neglect
the
broader
strategy
we
need
for
safer
more
prosperous
world
what
our
enemies
want
us
to
do
believe
in
smarter
kind
of
american
leadership
we
lead
best
when
we
combine
military
power
with
strong
diplomacy
when
we
leverage
our
power
with
coalition
building
when
we
let
our
fears
blind
us
to
the
opportunities
that
this
new
century
presents
exactly
what
doing
right
now
and
around
the
globe
it
is
making
difference
first
we
stand
united
with
people
around
the
world
who
have
been
targeted
by
terrorists
from
school
in
pakistan
to
the
streets
of
paris
we
will
continue
to
hunt
down
terrorists
and
dismantle
their
networks
and
we
reserve
the
right
to
act
unilaterally
as
we
have
done
relentlessly
since
took
office
to
take
out
terrorists
who
pose
direct
threat
to
us
and
our
allies
at
the
same
time
learned
some
costly
lessons
over
the
last
years
instead
of
americans
patrolling
the
valleys
of
trained
their
security
forces
who
have
now
taken
the
lead
and
our
sacrifice
by
supporting
that
first
democratic
transition
instead
of
sending
large
ground
forces
overseas
partnering
with
nations
from
south
asia
to
north
africa
to
deny
safe
haven
to
terrorists
who
threaten
america
in
iraq
and
syria
american
leadership
including
our
military
power
is
stopping
advance
instead
of
getting
dragged
into
another
ground
war
in
the
middle
east
we
are
leading
broad
coalition
including
arab
nations
to
degrade
and
ultimately
destroy
this
terrorist
group
also
supporting
moderate
opposition
in
syria
that
can
help
us
in
this
effort
and
assisting
people
everywhere
who
stand
up
to
the
bankrupt
ideology
of
violent
extremism
now
this
effort
will
take
time
it
will
require
focus
but
we
will
succeed
and
tonight
call
on
this
congress
to
show
the
world
that
we
are
united
in
this
mission
by
passing
resolution
to
the
use
of
force
against
we
need
that
authority
second
demonstrating
the
power
of
american
strength
and
diplomacy
upholding
the
principle
that
bigger
nations
bully
the
small
by
opposing
russian
aggression
and
supporting
democracy
and
reassuring
our
nato
allies
last
year
as
we
were
doing
the
hard
work
of
imposing
sanctions
along
with
our
allies
as
we
were
reinforcing
our
presence
with
frontline
states
aggression
it
was
suggested
was
masterful
display
of
strategy
and
strength
that
what
heard
from
some
folks
well
today
it
is
america
that
stands
strong
and
united
with
our
allies
while
russia
is
isolated
with
its
economy
in
tatters
how
america
leads
not
with
bluster
but
with
persistent
steady
resolve
in
cuba
we
are
ending
policy
that
was
long
past
its
expiration
date
when
what
doing
work
for
years
time
to
try
something
new
and
our
shift
in
cuba
policy
has
the
potential
to
end
legacy
of
mistrust
in
our
hemisphere
it
removes
phony
excuse
for
restrictions
in
cuba
it
stands
up
for
democratic
values
and
extends
the
hand
of
friendship
to
the
cuban
people
and
this
year
congress
should
begin
the
work
of
ending
the
embargo
as
his
holiness
pope
has
said
diplomacy
is
the
work
of
these
small
steps
have
added
up
to
new
hope
for
the
future
in
cuba
and
after
years
in
prison
we
are
overjoyed
that
gross
is
back
where
he
belongs
welcome
home
we
glad
you
here
our
diplomacy
is
at
work
with
respect
to
iran
where
for
the
first
time
in
decade
halted
the
progress
of
its
nuclear
program
and
reduced
its
stockpile
of
nuclear
material
between
now
and
this
spring
we
have
chance
to
negotiate
comprehensive
agreement
that
prevents
iran
secures
america
and
our
allies
including
israel
while
avoiding
yet
another
middle
east
conflict
there
are
no
guarantees
that
negotiations
will
succeed
and
keep
all
options
on
the
table
to
prevent
nuclear
iran
but
new
sanctions
passed
by
this
congress
at
this
moment
in
time
will
all
but
guarantee
that
diplomacy
fails
alienating
america
from
its
allies
making
it
harder
to
maintain
sanctions
and
ensuring
that
iran
starts
up
its
nuclear
program
again
it
make
sense
and
that
why
will
veto
any
new
sanctions
bill
that
threatens
to
undo
this
progress
the
american
people
expect
us
only
to
go
to
war
as
last
resort
and
intend
to
stay
true
to
that
wisdom
third
looking
beyond
the
issues
that
have
consumed
us
in
the
past
to
shape
the
coming
century
no
foreign
nation
no
hacker
should
be
able
to
shut
down
our
networks
steal
our
trade
secrets
or
invade
the
privacy
of
american
families
especially
our
kids
so
we
making
sure
our
government
integrates
intelligence
to
combat
threats
just
as
we
have
done
to
combat
terrorism
and
tonight
urge
this
congress
to
finally
pass
the
legislation
we
need
to
better
meet
the
evolving
threat
of
attacks
combat
identity
theft
and
protect
our
information
that
should
be
bipartisan
effort
if
we
act
leave
our
nation
and
our
economy
vulnerable
if
we
do
we
can
continue
to
protect
the
technologies
that
have
unleashed
untold
opportunities
for
people
around
the
globe
in
west
africa
our
troops
our
scientists
our
doctors
our
nurses
our
health
care
workers
are
rolling
back
saving
countless
lives
and
stopping
the
spread
of
disease
could
not
be
prouder
of
them
and
thank
this
congress
for
your
bipartisan
support
of
their
efforts
but
the
job
is
not
yet
done
and
the
world
needs
to
use
this
lesson
to
build
more
effective
global
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
of
future
pandemics
invest
in
smart
development
and
eradicate
extreme
poverty
in
the
asia
pacific
we
are
alliances
while
making
sure
that
other
nations
play
by
the
rules
in
how
they
trade
how
they
resolve
maritime
disputes
how
they
participate
in
meeting
common
international
challenges
like
and
disaster
relief
and
no
challenge
no
challenge
poses
greater
threat
to
future
generations
than
climate
change
was
the
warmest
year
on
record
now
one
year
make
trend
but
this
does
of
the
warmest
years
on
record
have
all
fallen
in
the
first
years
of
this
century
heard
some
folks
try
to
dodge
the
evidence
by
saying
not
scientists
that
we
have
enough
information
to
act
well
not
scientist
either
but
you
know
what
know
lot
of
really
good
scientists
at
and
at
and
at
our
major
universities
and
the
best
scientists
in
the
world
are
all
telling
us
that
our
activities
are
changing
the
climate
and
if
we
act
forcefully
continue
to
see
rising
oceans
longer
hotter
heat
waves
dangerous
droughts
and
floods
and
massive
disruptions
that
can
trigger
greater
migration
and
conflict
and
hunger
around
the
globe
the
pentagon
says
that
climate
change
poses
immediate
risks
to
our
national
security
we
should
act
like
it
and
why
over
the
past
six
years
done
more
than
ever
to
combat
climate
change
from
the
way
we
produce
energy
to
the
way
we
use
it
why
set
aside
more
public
lands
and
waters
than
any
administration
in
history
and
why
will
not
let
this
congress
endanger
the
health
of
our
children
by
turning
back
the
clock
on
our
efforts
am
determined
to
make
sure
that
american
leadership
drives
international
action
in
beijing
we
made
historic
announcement
the
united
states
will
double
the
pace
at
which
we
cut
carbon
pollution
and
china
committed
for
the
first
time
to
limiting
their
emissions
and
because
the
two
largest
economies
came
together
other
nations
are
now
stepping
up
and
offering
hope
that
this
year
the
world
will
finally
reach
an
agreement
to
protect
the
one
planet
got
and
one
last
pillar
of
our
leadership
and
the
example
of
our
values
as
americans
we
respect
human
dignity
even
when
threatened
which
is
why
have
prohibited
torture
and
worked
to
make
sure
our
use
of
new
technology
like
drones
is
properly
constrained
why
we
speak
out
against
the
deplorable
that
has
resurfaced
in
certain
parts
of
the
world
why
we
continue
to
reject
offensive
stereotypes
of
muslims
the
vast
majority
of
whom
share
our
commitment
to
peace
why
we
defend
free
and
advocate
for
political
prisoners
and
condemn
the
persecution
of
women
or
religious
minorities
or
people
who
are
lesbian
gay
bisexual
or
we
do
these
things
not
only
because
they
are
the
right
thing
to
do
but
because
ultimately
they
will
make
us
safer
as
americans
we
have
profound
commitment
to
justice
so
it
makes
no
sense
to
spend
million
per
prisoner
to
keep
open
prison
that
the
world
condemns
and
terrorists
use
to
recruit
since
been
president
worked
responsibly
to
cut
the
population
of
in
half
now
it
is
time
to
finish
the
job
and
will
not
relent
in
my
determination
to
shut
it
down
it
is
not
who
we
are
time
to
close
as
americans
we
cherish
our
civil
liberties
and
we
need
to
uphold
that
commitment
if
we
want
maximum
cooperation
from
other
countries
and
industry
in
our
fight
against
terrorist
networks
so
while
some
have
moved
on
from
the
debates
over
our
surveillance
programs
have
not
as
promised
our
intelligence
agencies
have
worked
hard
with
the
recommendations
of
privacy
advocates
to
increase
transparency
and
build
more
safeguards
against
potential
abuse
and
next
month
issue
report
on
how
keeping
our
promise
to
keep
our
country
safe
while
strengthening
privacy
looking
to
the
future
instead
of
the
past
making
sure
we
match
our
power
with
diplomacy
and
use
force
wisely
building
coalitions
to
meet
new
challenges
and
opportunities
leading
always
with
the
example
of
our
values
what
makes
us
exceptional
what
keeps
us
strong
why
we
have
to
keep
striving
to
hold
ourselves
to
the
highest
of
standards
our
own
you
know
just
over
decade
ago
gave
in
boston
where
said
there
liberal
america
or
conservative
america
black
america
or
white
america
but
united
states
of
america
said
this
because
had
seen
it
in
my
own
life
in
nation
that
gave
someone
like
me
chance
because
grew
up
in
hawaii
melting
pot
of
races
and
customs
because
made
illinois
my
home
state
of
small
towns
rich
farmland
one
of
the
great
cities
microcosm
of
the
country
where
democrats
and
republicans
and
independents
good
people
of
every
ethnicity
and
every
faith
share
certain
bedrock
values
over
the
past
six
years
the
pundits
have
pointed
out
more
than
once
that
my
presidency
delivered
on
this
vision
how
ironic
they
say
that
our
politics
seems
more
divided
than
ever
held
up
as
proof
not
just
of
my
own
flaws
of
which
there
are
many
but
also
as
proof
that
the
vision
itself
is
misguided
that
there
are
too
many
people
in
this
town
who
actually
benefit
from
partisanship
and
gridlock
for
us
to
ever
do
anything
about
it
know
how
tempting
such
cynicism
may
be
but
still
think
the
cynics
are
wrong
still
believe
that
we
are
one
people
still
believe
that
together
we
can
do
great
things
even
when
the
odds
are
long
believe
this
because
over
and
over
in
my
six
years
in
office
have
seen
america
at
its
best
seen
the
hopeful
faces
of
young
graduates
from
new
york
to
california
and
our
newest
officers
at
west
point
springs
new
london
mourned
with
grieving
families
in
and
in
boston
in
west
texas
and
west
virginia
watched
americans
beat
back
adversity
from
the
gulf
coast
to
the
great
plains
from
assembly
lines
to
the
seaboard
seen
something
like
gay
marriage
go
from
wedge
issue
used
to
drive
us
apart
to
story
of
freedom
across
our
country
civil
right
now
legal
in
states
that
seven
in
americans
call
home
so
know
the
good
and
optimistic
and
generosity
of
the
american
people
who
every
day
live
the
idea
that
we
are
our
keeper
and
our
keeper
and
know
they
expect
those
of
us
who
serve
here
to
set
better
example
so
the
question
for
those
of
us
here
tonight
is
how
we
all
of
us
can
better
reflect
hopes
served
in
congress
with
many
of
you
know
many
of
you
well
there
are
lot
of
good
people
here
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
and
many
of
you
have
told
me
that
this
what
you
signed
up
for
arguing
past
each
other
on
cable
shows
the
constant
fundraising
always
looking
over
your
shoulder
at
how
the
base
will
react
to
every
decision
imagine
if
we
broke
out
of
these
tired
old
patterns
imagine
if
we
did
something
different
understand
better
politics
one
where
democrats
abandon
their
agenda
or
republicans
simply
embrace
mine
better
politics
is
one
where
we
appeal
to
each
basic
decency
instead
of
our
basest
fears
better
politics
is
one
where
we
debate
without
each
other
where
we
talk
issues
and
values
and
principles
and
facts
rather
than
moments
or
trivial
gaffes
or
fake
controversies
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
daily
lives
politics
better
politics
is
one
where
we
spend
less
time
drowning
in
dark
money
for
that
pull
us
into
the
gutter
and
spend
more
time
lifting
young
people
up
with
sense
of
purpose
and
possibility
asking
them
to
join
in
the
great
mission
of
building
america
if
going
to
have
arguments
have
arguments
but
make
them
debates
worthy
of
this
body
and
worthy
of
this
country
we
still
may
not
agree
on
right
to
choose
but
surely
we
can
agree
good
thing
that
teen
pregnancies
and
abortions
are
nearing
lows
and
that
every
woman
should
have
access
to
the
health
care
that
she
needs
yes
passions
still
fly
on
immigration
but
surely
we
can
all
see
something
of
ourselves
in
the
striving
young
student
and
agree
that
no
one
benefits
when
hardworking
mom
is
snatched
from
her
child
and
that
possible
to
shape
law
that
upholds
our
tradition
as
nation
of
laws
and
nation
of
immigrants
talked
to
republicans
and
democrats
about
that
something
that
we
can
share
we
may
go
at
it
in
campaign
season
but
surely
we
can
agree
that
the
right
to
vote
is
sacred
that
being
denied
to
too
many
and
that
on
this
anniversary
of
the
great
march
from
to
and
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
we
can
come
together
democrats
and
republicans
to
make
voting
easier
for
every
single
american
we
may
have
different
takes
on
the
events
of
and
new
york
but
surely
we
can
understand
father
who
fears
his
son
walk
home
without
being
harassed
and
surely
we
can
understand
the
wife
who
rest
until
the
police
officer
she
married
walks
through
the
front
door
at
the
end
of
his
shift
and
surely
we
can
agree
that
good
thing
that
for
the
first
time
in
years
the
crime
rate
and
the
incarceration
rate
have
come
down
together
and
use
that
as
starting
point
for
democrats
and
republicans
community
leaders
and
law
enforcement
to
reform
criminal
justice
system
so
that
it
protects
and
serves
all
of
us
better
politics
how
we
start
rebuilding
trust
how
we
move
this
country
forward
what
the
american
people
want
and
what
they
deserve
have
no
more
campaigns
to
run
my
only
agenda
know
because
won
both
of
them

only
agenda
for
the
next
two
years
is
the
same
as
the
one

an
oath

the

america

she

sitting

give
big
round
of
applause
once
again
distinguished
guests
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
all
the
students
and
young
people
who
are
here
today
to
the
people
of
india
watching
and
listening
across
this
vast
nation
bring
the
friendship
and
the
greetings
of
the
american
people
on
behalf
of
myself
and
thank
you
so
much
for
welcoming
us
back
to
india
it
has
been
great
to
be
the
first
american
president
to
join
you
for
republic
day
with
the
waving
above
us
we
celebrated
the
strength
of
your
constitution
we
paid
tribute
to
india
fallen
in
yesterday
parade
we
saw
the
pride
and
the
diversity
of
this
nation
including
the
dare
devils
on
their
royal
which
was
very
impressive
secret
service
does
not
let
me
ride
motorcycles
especially
not
on
my
head
that
the
sight
of
an
american
president
as
your
chief
guest
on
republic
day
would
have
once
seemed
unimaginable
but
my
visit
reflects
the
possibilities
of
new
moment
as
said
many
times
believe
that
the
relationship
between
india
and
the
united
states
can
be
one
of
the
defining
partnerships
of
this
century
when
spoke
to
your
parliament
on
my
last
visit
laid
out
my
vision
for
how
our
two
nations
can
build
that
partnership
and
today
want
to
speak
directly
to
you
the
people
of
india
about
what
believe
we
can
achieve
together
and
how
we
can
do
it
my
commitment
to
new
chapter
between
our
countries
flows
from
the
deep
friendship
between
our
people
and
and
have
felt
it
ourselves
india
with
the
first
state
visit
of
my
presidency
where
we
also
danced
to
some
pretty
good
for
the
first
time
we
brought
to
the
white
house
on
our
last
celebration
here
we
celebrated
the
festival
of
lights
in
we
danced
with
some
children
unfortunately
we
were
not
able
to
schedule
any
dancing
this
visit
you
know
what
mean
everybody
said
by
the
way
how
much
better
dance
was
than
me
which
hurt
my
feelings
little
bit
on
more
personal
level
india
represents
an
intersection
of
two
men
who
have
always
inspired
me
when
reverend
martin
luther
king
was
protesting
racial
segregation
in
the
united
states
he
said
that
his
guiding
light
was
mahatma
gandhi
when
king
came
to
india
he
said
that
being
here
in
gandhi
land
reaffirmed
his
conviction
that
in
the
struggle
for
justice
and
human
dignity
the
most
potent
weapon
of
all
is
resistance
and
those
two
great
souls
are
why
we
can
gather
here
together
today
indians
and
americans
equal
and
free
and
there
is
another
link
that
binds
us
more
than
years
ago
america
welcomed
son
of
india
and
he
helped
bring
hinduism
and
yoga
to
our
country
and
he
came
to
my
of
chicago
and
there
at
great
gathering
of
religious
leaders
he
spoke
of
his
faith
and
the
divinity
in
every
soul
and
the
purity
of
love
and
he
began
his
with
simple
greeting
sisters
and
brothers
of
america
so
today
let
me
say
sisters
and
brothers
of
india
my
confidence
in
what
our
nations
can
achieve
together
is
rooted
in
the
values
we
share
for
we
may
have
our
different
histories
and
speak
different
languages
but
when
we
look
at
each
other
we
see
reflection
of
ourselves
having
thrown
off
colonialism
we
created
constitutions
that
began
with
the
same
three
words
we
the
people
as
societies
that
celebrate
knowledge
and
innovation
we
transformed
ourselves
into
hubs
of
the
global
economy
together
we
unlock
new
discoveries
from
the
particles
of
creation
to
outer
space
two
nations
to
have
gone
to
both
the
moon
and
to
mars
and
here
in
india
this
dynamism
has
resulted
in
stunning
achievement
you
lifted
countless
millions
from
poverty
and
built
one
of
the
world
largest
middle
classes
and
nobody
embodies
this
progress
and
this
sense
of
possibility
more
than
our
young
people
empowered
by
technology
you
are
connecting
and
collaborating
like
never
before
on
and
and
twitter
and
chances
are
you
talking
to
someone
in
america
your
friends
your
cousins
the
united
states
has
the
largest
indian
diaspora
in
the
world
including
some
three
million
proud
and
they
make
america
stronger
and
they
tie
us
together
bonds
of
family
and
friendship
that
allow
us
to
share
in
each
other
success
for
all
these
reasons
india
and
the
united
states
are
not
just
natural
partners
believe
america
can
be
india
best
partner
believe
that
of
course
only
indians
can
decide
india
role
in
the
world
but
here
because
absolutely
convinced
that
both
our
peoples
will
have
more
jobs
and
opportunity
and
our
nations
will
be
more
secure
and
the
world
will
be
safer
and
more
just
place
when
our
two
democracies
the
world
largest
democracy
and
the
world
oldest
democracy
stand
together
believe
that
so
here
in
new
delhi
prime
minister
and
have
begun
this
work
anew
and
here
what
think
we
can
do
together
america
wants
to
be
your
partner
as
you
lift
up
the
lives
of
the
indian
people
and
provide
greater
opportunity
so
working
together
we
giving
farmers
new
techniques
and
data
from
our
satellites
to
their
cell
phones
to
increase
yields
and
boost
incomes
we
joining
you
in
your
effort
to
empower
every
indian
with
bank
account
and
with
the
breakthroughs
we
achieved
on
this
visit
we
can
finally
move
toward
fully
implementing
our
civil
nuclear
agreement
which
will
mean
more
reliable
electricity
for
indians
and
cleaner
energy
that
helps
fight
climate
change
and
do
have
to
describe
for
you
what
more
electricity
means
students
being
able
to
study
at
night
businesses
being
able
to
stay
open
longer
and
hire
more
workers
farmers
being
able
to
use
tools
that
increase
their
productivity
whole
communities
seeing
more
prosperity
in
recent
years
india
has
lifted
more
people
out
of
poverty
than
any
other
country
and
now
we
have
historic
opportunity
with
india
leading
the
way
to
end
the
injustice
of
extreme
poverty
all
around
the
world
america
wants
to
be
your
partner
as
you
protect
the
health
of
your
people
and
the
beauty
of
this
land
from
the
backwaters
of
to
the
banks
of
ganges
as
we
deliver
more
energy
more
electricity
let
do
it
with
clean
renewable
energy
like
solar
and
wind
and
let
put
cleaner
vehicles
on
the
road
and
more
filtration
systems
on
farms
and
villages
because
every
child
should
be
able
to
drink
clean
water
and
every
child
should
be
able
to
breathe
clean
air
we
need
our
young
people
healthy
for
their
futures
and
we
can
do
it
we
have
the
technology
to
do
it
america
wants
to
be
your
partner
in
igniting
the
next
wave
of
indian
growth
as
india
pursues
more
trade
and
investment
we
want
to
be
first
in
line
we
ready
to
join
you
in
building
new
infrastructure
the
roads
and
the
airports
the
ports
the
bullet
trains
to
propel
india
into
the
future
we
ready
to
help
design
smart
cities
that
serve
citizens
better
and
we
want
to
develop
more
advanced
technologies
with
india
as
we
do
with
our
closest
allies
we
believe
we
can
be
even
closer
partners
in
ensuring
our
mutual
security
and
both
our
nations
have
known
the
anguish
of
terrorism
and
we
stand
united
in
the
of
our
people
and
now
we
deepening
our
cooperation
against
new
challenges
the
united
states
welcomes
greater
role
for
india
in
the
asia
pacific
where
the
freedom
of
navigation
must
be
upheld
and
disputes
must
be
resolved
peacefully
and
even
as
we
acknowledge
the
world
as
it
is
we
must
never
stop
working
for
the
world
as
it
should
be
world
without
nuclear
weapons
that
should
be
goal
for
all
of
us
believe
that
if
we
going
to
be
true
global
partners
then
our
two
nations
must
do
more
around
the
world
together
so
to
ensure
international
security
and
peace
multilateral
institutions
created
in
the
century
have
to
be
updated
for
the
and
that
why
support
reformed
united
nations
security
council
that
includes
india
as
permanent
member
of
course
as
said
before
with
power
comes
responsibility
in
this
region
india
can
play
positive
role
in
helping
countries
forge
better
future
from
burma
to
where
today
there
new
hope
for
democracy
with
your
experience
in
elections
you
can
help
other
countries
with
theirs
with
your
expertise
in
science
and
medicine
india
can
do
more
around
the
world
to
fight
disease
and
develop
new
vaccines
and
help
us
end
the
moral
outrage
of
even
single
child
dying
from
preventable
disease
together
we
can
stand
up
against
human
trafficking
and
work
to
end
the
scourge
of
modern
day
slavery
and
being
global
partners
means
confronting
the
urgent
global
challenge
of
climate
change
with
rising
seas
melting
glaciers
more
unpredictable
monsoons
cyclones
getting
stronger
few
countries
will
be
more
affected
by
warmer
planet
than
india
and
the
united
states
our
part
in
creating
this
problem
so
we
leading
the
global
effort
to
combat
it
and
today
can
say
that
america
carbon
pollution
is
near
its
lowest
level
in
almost
two
decades
know
the
argument
made
by
some
that
it
unfair
for
countries
like
the
united
states
to
ask
developing
nations
and
emerging
economies
like
india
to
reduce
your
dependence
on
the
same
fossil
fuels
that
helped
power
our
growth
for
more
than
century
but
here
the
truth
even
if
countries
like
the
united
states
curb
our
emissions
if
countries
that
are
growing
rapidly
like
india
with
soaring
energy
needs
do
also
embrace
cleaner
fuels
then
we
do
stand
chance
against
climate
change
so
we
welcome
india
ambitious
targets
for
generating
more
clean
energy
we
continue
to
help
india
deal
with
the
impacts
of
climate
change
because
you
should
have
to
bear
that
burden
alone
as
we
keep
working
for
strong
global
agreement
on
climate
change
it
young
people
like
you
who
have
to
speak
up
so
we
can
protect
this
planet
for
your
generation
be
gone
when
the
worst
effects
happen
it
your
generation
and
your
children
that
are
going
to
be
impacted
that
why
it
urgent
that
we
begin
this
work
right
now
development
that
lifts
up
the
lives
and
health
of
our
people
trade
and
economic
partnerships
that
reduce
poverty
and
create
opportunity
leadership
in
the
world
that
defends
our
security
and
advances
human
dignity
and
protects
our
planet
that
what
believe
india
and
america
can
do
together
so
with
the
rest
of
my
time
want
to
discuss
how
we
can
do
it
because
in
big
and
diverse
societies
like
ours
progress
ultimately
depends
on
something
more
basic
and
that
is
how
we
see
each
other
and
we
know
from
experience
what
makes
nations
strong
and
think
did
great
job
of
describing
the
essence
of
what
important
here
we
are
strongest
when
we
see
the
inherent
dignity
in
every
human
being
look
at
our
countries
the
incredible
diversity
even
here
in
this
hall
india
is
defined
by
countless
languages
and
dialects
and
every
and
caste
and
creed
gender
and
orientations
and
likewise
in
america
we
black
and
white
and
latino
and
asian
and
and
native
american
your
constitution
begins
with
the
pledge
to
uphold
the
dignity
of
the
individual
and
our
declaration
of
independence
proclaims
that
all
men
are
created
equal
in
both
our
countries
generations
have
worked
to
live
up
to
these
ideals
when
he
came
to
india
martin
luther
king
was
introduced
to
some
schoolchildren
as
fellow
untouchable
my
grandfather
was
cook
for
the
british
army
in
kenya
the
distant
branches
of
family
tree
include
both
slaves
and
slave
owners
when
we
were
born
people
who
looked
like
us
still
could
vote
in
some
parts
of
the
country
even
as
america
has
blessed
us
with
extraordinary
opportunities
there
were
moments
in
my
life
where
been
treated
differently
because
of
the
of
my
skin
many
countries
including
the
united
states
grapple
with
questions
of
identity
and
inequality
and
how
we
treat
each
other
people
who
are
different
than
us
how
we
deal
with
diversity
of
beliefs
and
of
faiths
right
now
in
crowded
not
far
from
here
man
is
driving
an
or
washing
somebody
else
clothes
or
doing
the
hard
work
no
one
else
will
do
and
woman
is
cleaning
somebody
else
house
and
young
man
is
on
bicycle
delivering
lunch
little
girl
is
hauling
heavy
bucket
of
water
and
believe
their
dreams
their
hopes
are
just
as
important
just
as
beautiful
just
as
worthy
as
ours
and
so
even
as
we
live
in
world
of
terrible
inequality
we
also
proud
to
live
in
countries
where
even
the
grandson
of
cook
can
become
president
or
even
can
help
write
constitution
and
even
tea
seller
can
become
prime
minister
the
point
is
is
that
the
aim
of
our
work
must
be
not
to
just
have
few
do
well
but
to
have
everybody
have
chance
everybody
who
is
willing
to
work
for
it
have
the
ability
to
dream
big
and
then
reach
those
dreams
our
nations
are
strongest
when
we
uphold
the
equality
of
all
our
people
and
that
includes
our
women
now
you
may
have
noticed
married
to
very
strong
and
talented
woman
is
not
afraid
to
speak
her
mind
or
tell
me
when
wrong
which
happens
frequently
and
we
have
two
beautiful
daughters
so
surrounded
by
smart
strong
women
and
in
raising
our
girls
we
tried
to
in
them
basic
values
sense
of
compassion
for
others
and
respect
for
themselves
and
the
confidence
that
they
can
go
as
far
as
their
imaginations
and
abilities
will
carry
them
and
as
part
of
work
as
first
lady
she
met
with
women
and
girls
around
the
world
including
here
in
india
to
let
them
know
that
america
believes
in
them
too
in
the
united
states
we
still
working
to
make
sure
that
women
and
girls
have
all
the
opportunities
they
deserve
and
that
they
treated
equally
and
we
have
some
great
role
models
including
here
today
the
former
speaker
of
our
house
of
representatives
the
first
woman
speaker
of
the
house
and
my
great
partner
and
here
in
india
it
the
wives
and
the
mothers
who
so
often
hold
families
and
communities
together
indian
women
have
shown
that
they
can
succeed
in
every
field
including
government
where
many
of
your
leaders
are
women
and
the
young
women
who
are
here
today
are
part
of
new
generation
that
is
making
your
voice
heard
and
standing
up
and
determined
to
play
your
part
in
india
progress
and
here
what
we
know
we
know
from
experience
that
nations
are
more
successful
when
their
women
are
successful
when
girls
go
to
school
this
is
one
of
the
most
direct
measures
of
whether
nation
is
going
to
develop
effectively
is
how
it
treats
its
women
when
girl
goes
to
school
it
does
just
open
up
her
young
mind
it
benefits
all
of
us
because
maybe
someday
she
start
her
own
business
or
invent
new
technology
or
cure
disease
and
when
women
are
able
to
work
families
are
healthier
and
communities
are
wealthier
and
entire
countries
are
more
prosperous
and
when
young
women
are
educated
then
their
children
are
going
to
be
well
educated
and
have
more
opportunity
so
if
nations
really
want
to
succeed
in
today
global
economy
they
simply
ignore
the
talents
of
half
their
people
and
as
husbands
and
fathers
and
brothers
we
have
to
step
up
because
every
girl
life
matters
every
daughter
deserves
the
same
chance
as
our
sons
every
woman
should
be
able
to
go
about
her
day
to
walk
the
streets
or
ride
the
bus
and
be
safe
and
be
treated
with
respect
and
dignity
she
deserves
that
and
one
of
the
things
about
this
trip
for
me
has
been
to
see
all
these
incredible
indian
women
in
the
armed
forces
including
the
person
who
commanded
the
guard
that
greeted
me
when
arrived
it
remarkable
and
it
sign
of
great
strength
and
great
progress
our
nations
are
strongest
when
we
see
that
we
are
all
god
children
all
equal
in
his
eyes
and
worthy
of
his
love
across
our
two
great
countries
we
have
and
muslims
and
and
jews
and
and
and
so
many
faiths
and
we
remember
the
wisdom
of
who
said
for
me
the
different
religions
are
beautiful
flowers
from
the
same
garden
or
they
are
branches
of
the
same
majestic
tree
branches
of
the
same
majestic
tree
our
freedom
of
religion
is
written
into
our
founding
documents
it
part
of
america
very
first
amendment
your
article
says
that
all
people
are
equally
entitled
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
the
right
freely
to
profess
practice
and
propagate
religion
in
both
our
countries
in
all
countries
upholding
this
fundamental
freedom
is
the
responsibility
of
government
but
it
also
the
responsibility
of
every
person
in
our
lives
and
have
been
strengthened
by
our
christian
faith
but
there
have
been
times
where
my
faith
has
been
questioned
by
people
who
do
know
me
or
they
said
that
adhere
to
different
religion
as
if
that
were
somehow
bad
thing
around
the
world
we
seen
intolerance
and
violence
and
terror
perpetrated
by
those
who
profess
to
be
standing
up
for
their
faith
but
in
fact
are
betraying
it
no
society
is
immune
from
the
darkest
impulses
of
man
and
too
often
religion
has
been
used
to
tap
into
those
darker
impulses
as
opposed
to
the
light
of
god
three
years
ago
in
our
state
of
back
in
the
united
states
man
went
to
temple
and
in
terrible
act
of
violence
killed
six
innocent
people
americans
and
indians
and
in
that
moment
of
shared
grief
our
two
countries
reaffirmed
basic
truth
as
we
must
again
today
that
every
person
has
the
right
to
practice
their
faith
how
they
choose
or
to
practice
no
faith
at
all
and
to
do
so
free
of
persecution
and
fear
and
discrimination
the
peace
we
seek
in
the
world
begins
in
human
hearts
and
it
finds
its
glorious
expression
when
we
look
beyond
any
differences
in
religion
or
tribe
and
rejoice
in
the
beauty
of
every
soul
and
nowhere
is
that
more
important
than
india
nowhere
is
it
going
to
be
more
necessary
for
that
foundational
value
to
be
upheld
india
will
succeed
so
long
as
it
is
not
splintered
along
the
lines
of
religious
faith
so
long
as
it
not
splintered
along
any
lines
and
is
unified
as
one
nation
and
it
when
all
indians
whatever
your
faith
go
to
the
movies
and
applaud
actors
like
shah
khan
and
when
you
celebrate
athletes
like
or
mary
and
every
indian
can
take
pride
in
the
courage
of
humanitarian
who
liberates
boys
and
girls
from
forced
and
exploitation
who
is
here
today
our
most
recent
winner
of
the
prize
for
peace
so
that
what
unifies
us
do
we
act
with
compassion
and
empathy
are
we
measured
by
our
efforts
by
what
king
called
the
content
of
our
character
rather
than
the
of
our
skin
or
the
manner
in
which
we
worship
our
god
in
both
our
countries
in
india
and
in
america
our
diversity
is
our
strength
and
we
have
to
guard
against
any
efforts
to
divide
ourselves
along
sectarian
lines
or
any
other
lines
and
if
we
do
that
well
if
america
shows
itself
as
an
example
of
its
diversity
and
yet
the
capacity
to
live
together
and
work
together
in
common
effort
in
common
purpose
if
india
as
massive
as
it
is
with
so
much
diversity
so
many
differences
is
able
to
continually
affirm
its
democracy
that
is
an
example
for
every
other
country
on
earth
that
what
makes
us
world
leaders
not
just
the
size
of
our
economy
or
the
number
of
weapons
we
have
but
our
ability
to
show
the
way
in
how
we
work
together
and
how
much
respect
we
show
each
other
and
finally
our
nations
are
strongest
when
we
empower
our
young
people
because
ultimately
you
the
one
who
has
to
break
down
these
old
stereotypes
and
these
old
barriers
these
old
ways
of
thinking
prejudices
and
stereotypes
and
assumptions
those
are
what
happens
to
old
minds
like
mine
getting
hair
now
was
more
youthful
when
first
started
this
office
and
that
why
young
people
are
so
important
in
these
efforts
here
in
india
most
people
are
under
years
old
and
india
is
on
track
to
become
the
world
most
populous
country
so
young
indians
like
you
are
just
going
to
define
the
future
of
this
nation
you
going
to
shape
the
world
like
young
people
everywhere
you
want
to
get
an
education
and
find
good
job
and
make
your
mark
and
it
not
easy
but
in
our
two
countries
it
possible
remember
and
do
come
from
wealthy
backgrounds
or
famous
families
our
families
did
have
lot
of
money
we
did
have
parents
and
teachers
and
communities
that
cared
about
us
and
with
the
help
of
scholarships
and
student
loans
we
were
able
to
attend
some
of
best
schools
of
the
world
without
that
education
we
would
be
here
today
so
whether
it
in
america
or
here
in
india
or
around
the
world
we
believe
young
people
like
you
ought
to
have
every
chance
to
pursue
your
dreams
as
well
so
as
india
builds
new
community
colleges
we
link
you
with
our
own
so
more
young
people
graduate
with
the
skills
and
training
to
succeed
we
increase
collaborations
between
our
colleges
and
universities
and
help
create
the
next
india
institute
of
technology
we
encourage
young
entrepreneurs
who
want
to
start
business
and
we
increase
exchanges
because
want
more
american
students
coming
to
india
and
more
indian
students
coming
to
america
and
that
way
we
can
learn
from
each
other
and
we
can
go
further
because
one
other
thing
we
have
in
common
indians
and
americans
are
some
of
the
hardest
working
people
on
earth
and
seen
that
and
have
seen
that
in
family
here
in
india
just
want
to
tell
you
quick
story
on
our
last
visit
here
we
visited
tomb
and
while
we
were
there
we
met
some
of
the
who
are
the
backbone
of
this
nation
progress
we
met
their
children
and
their
families
as
well
and
some
wonderful
young
children
with
bright
smiles
sparks
in
their
eyes
and
one
of
the
children
we
met
was
boy
named
and
today
is
years
old
and
he
and
his
family
live
in
south
delhi
in
the
village
of
band
and
his
mother
works
hard
in
their
modest
home
and
his
sister
is
now
in
university
she
wants
to
become
teacher
his
brother
is
construction
worker
earning
his
daily
wage
and
his
father
works
as
stone
layer
farther
away
but
sends
home
what
little
he
makes
so
can
go
to
school
and
loves
math
and
mostly
he
studies
and
when
he
not
studying
he
likes
watching
and
he
dreams
of
someday
joining
the
indian
armed
forces
and
we
grateful
that
and
his
family
joined
us
today
we
very
proud
of
him
because
he
an
example
of
the
talent
that
here
and
dreams
are
as
important
as
and
dreams
our
daughters
and
we
want
him
to
have
the
same
opportunities
sisters
and
brothers
of
india
we
are
not
perfect
countries
and
we
known
tragedy
and
we
known
triumph
we
home
to
glittering
skyscrapers
but
also
terrible
poverty
and
new
wealth
but
also
rising
inequality
we
have
many
challenges
in
front
of
us
but
the
reason
stand
here
today
and
am
so
optimistic
about
our
future
together
is
that
despite
our
imperfections
our
two
nations
possess
the
keys
to
progress
in
the
century
ahead
we
vote
in
free
elections
we
work
and
we
build
and
we
innovate
we
lift
up
the
least
among
us
we
reach
for
heights
previous
generations
could
not
even
imagine
we
respect
human
rights
and
human
dignity
and
it
is
recorded
in
our
constitutions
and
we
keep
striving
to
live
up
to
those
ideals
put
to
paper
all
those
years
ago
and
we
do
these
things
because
they
make
our
lives
better
and
safer
and
more
prosperous
but
we
also
do
them
because
our
moral
imaginations
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
our
own
lives
and
we
believe
that
the
circumstances
of
our
birth
need
not
dictate
the
arc
of
our
lives
we
believe
in
the
father
working
far
from
home
sending
money
back
so
his
family
might
have
better
life
we
believe
in
the
mother
who
goes
without
so
that
her
children
might
have
something
more
we
believe
in
the
earning
his
daily
wage
and
the
student
pursuing
her
degree
and
we
believe
in
young
boy
who
knows
that
if
he
just
keeps
studying
if
he
just
given
the
chance
his
hopes
might
be
too
we
are
all
beautiful
flowers
from
the
same
of
the
same
majestic
tree
and
the
first
american
president
to
come
to
your
country
twice
but
predict
will
not
be
the
last
because
as
americans
we
believe
in
the
promise
of
india
we
believe
in
the
people
of
india
we
are
proud
to
be
your
friend
we
are
proud
to
be
your
partner
as
you
build
the
country
of
your
dreams
hind
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
please
please
thank
you
well
good
morning
giving
all
praise
and
to
god
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
with
you
here
want
to
thank
our
bob
and
these
two
do
always
agree
in
the
senate
but
in
coming
together
and
uniting
us
all
in
prayer
they
embody
the
spirit
of
our
gathering
today
also
want
to
thank
everybody
who
helped
this
breakfast
it
wonderful
to
see
so
many
friends
and
faith
leaders
and
dignitaries
and
and
are
truly
to
be
joining
you
here
today
want
to
offer
special
welcome
to
good
friend
his
holiness
the
lama
who
is
powerful
example
of
what
it
means
to
practice
compassion
who
inspires
us
to
speak
up
for
the
freedom
and
dignity
of
all
human
beings
been
pleased
to
welcome
him
to
the
white
house
on
many
occasions
and
we
grateful
that
he
able
to
join
us
here
today
there
are
that
many
occasions
that
bring
his
holiness
under
the
same
roof
as
this
may
be
the
first
but
god
works
in
mysterious
ways
and
so
want
to
thank
for
that
wonderful
presentation
knows
that
when
you
going
miles
an
hour
little
prayer
can
not
hurt
suspect
that
more
than
once
has
had
the
same
thought
as
many
of
us
have
in
our
own
lives
jesus
take
the
wheel
although
hope
that
you
kept
your
hands
on
the
wheel
when
you
were
thinking
that
he
and
obviously
share
something
in
having
married
up
and
we
are
so
grateful
to
for
the
incredible
work
that
they
done
together
to
build
ministry
where
the
fastest
drivers
can
slow
down
little
bit
and
spend
some
time
in
prayer
and
reflection
and
thanks
and
we
certainly
want
to
wish
happy
birthday
happy
birthday
will
note
though
when
you
were
reading
that
list
of
things
folks
were
saying
about
you
was
thinking
well
you
mean
that
mean
if
you
really
want
list
come
talk
to
me
because
that
nothing
that
the
best
they
can
do
in
slowing
down
and
pausing
for
fellowship
and
prayer
that
what
this
breakfast
is
about
think
it
fair
to
say
washington
moves
lot
slower
than
certainly
my
agenda
does
sometimes
but
still
it
easier
to
get
caught
up
in
the
rush
of
our
lives
and
in
the
political
that
can
take
over
this
city
we
get
sidetracked
with
distractions
large
and
small
we
go
minutes
without
checking
our
and
for
my
staff
that
every
seconds
and
so
for
years
this
prayer
tradition
has
brought
us
together
giving
us
the
opportunity
to
come
together
in
humility
before
the
almighty
and
to
be
reminded
of
what
it
is
that
we
share
as
children
of
god
and
certainly
for
me
this
is
always
chance
to
reflect
on
my
own
faith
journey
many
times
as
president
been
reminded
of
line
of
prayer
that
was
fond
of
she
said
keep
us
at
tasks
too
hard
for
us
that
we
may
be
driven
to
thee
for
strength
keep
us
at
tasks
too
hard
for
us
that
we
may
be
driven
to
thee
for
strength
wondered
at
times
if
maybe
god
was
answering
that
prayer
little
too
literally
but
no
matter
the
challenge
he
has
been
there
for
all
of
us
he
certainly
strengthened
me
with
the
power
through
his
spirit
as
sought
his
guidance
not
just
in
my
own
life
but
in
the
life
of
our
nation
now
over
the
last
few
months
we
seen
number
of
challenges
certainly
over
the
last
six
years
but
part
of
what
want
to
touch
on
today
is
the
degree
to
which
we
seen
professions
of
faith
used
both
as
an
instrument
of
great
good
but
also
twisted
and
misused
in
the
name
of
evil
as
we
speak
around
the
world
we
see
faith
inspiring
people
to
lift
up
one
another
to
feed
the
hungry
and
care
for
the
poor
and
comfort
the
afflicted
and
make
peace
where
there
is
strife
we
heard
the
good
work
that
sister
has
done
in
and
the
incredible
work
that
kent
and
his
colleagues
have
done
we
see
faith
driving
us
to
do
right
but
we
also
see
faith
being
twisted
and
distorted
used
as
wedge
or
worse
sometimes
used
as
weapon
from
school
in
pakistan
to
the
streets
of
paris
we
have
seen
violence
and
terror
perpetrated
by
those
who
profess
to
stand
up
for
faith
their
faith
professed
to
stand
up
for
islam
but
in
fact
are
betraying
it
we
see
brutal
vicious
death
cult
that
in
the
name
of
religion
carries
out
unspeakable
acts
of
barbarism
religious
minorities
like
the
subjecting
women
to
rape
as
weapon
of
war
and
claiming
the
mantle
of
religious
authority
for
such
actions
we
see
sectarian
war
in
syria
the
murder
of
muslims
and
in
nigeria
religious
war
in
the
central
african
republic
rising
tide
of
and
hate
crimes
in
europe
so
often
perpetrated
in
the
name
of
religion
so
how
do
we
as
people
of
faith
reconcile
these
realities
the
profound
good
the
strength
the
tenacity
the
compassion
and
love
that
can
flow
from
all
of
our
faiths
operating
alongside
those
who
seek
to
hijack
religious
for
their
own
murderous
ends
humanity
has
been
grappling
with
these
questions
throughout
human
history
and
lest
we
get
on
our
high
horse
and
think
this
is
unique
to
some
other
place
remember
that
during
the
crusades
and
the
inquisition
people
committed
terrible
deeds
in
the
name
of
christ
in
our
home
country
slavery
and
crow
all
too
often
was
justified
in
the
name
of
christ
and
returned
from
india
an
incredible
beautiful
country
full
of
magnificent
diversity
but
place
where
in
past
years
religious
faiths
of
all
types
have
on
occasion
been
targeted
by
other
peoples
of
faith
simply
due
to
their
heritage
and
their
beliefs
acts
of
intolerance
that
would
have
shocked
the
person
who
helped
to
liberate
that
nation
so
this
is
not
unique
to
one
group
or
one
religion
there
is
tendency
in
us
sinful
tendency
that
can
pervert
and
distort
our
faith
in
today
world
when
hate
groups
have
their
own
twitter
accounts
and
bigotry
can
fester
in
hidden
places
in
cyberspace
it
can
be
even
harder
to
counteract
such
intolerance
but
god
compels
us
to
try
and
in
this
mission
believe
there
are
few
principles
that
can
guide
us
particularly
those
of
us
who
profess
to
believe
and
first
we
should
start
with
some
basic
humility
believe
that
the
starting
point
of
faith
is
some
doubt
not
being
so
full
of
yourself
and
so
confident
that
you
are
right
and
that
god
speaks
only
to
us
and
does
speak
to
others
that
god
only
cares
about
us
and
does
care
about
others
that
somehow
we
alone
are
in
possession
of
the
truth
our
job
is
not
to
ask
that
god
respond
to
our
notion
of
truth
our
job
is
to
be
true
to
him
his
word
and
his
commandments
and
we
should
assume
humbly
that
we
confused
and
do
always
know
what
we
doing
and
we
staggering
and
stumbling
towards
him
and
have
some
humility
in
that
process
and
that
means
we
have
to
speak
up
against
those
who
would
misuse
his
name
to
justify
oppression
or
violence
or
hatred
with
that
fierce
certainty
no
god
condones
terror
no
grievance
justifies
the
taking
of
innocent
lives
or
the
oppression
of
those
who
are
weaker
or
fewer
in
number
and
so
as
people
of
faith
we
are
summoned
to
push
back
against
those
who
try
to
distort
our
religion
any
religion
for
their
own
nihilistic
ends
and
here
at
home
and
around
the
world
we
will
constantly
reaffirm
that
fundamental
freedom
freedom
of
religion
the
right
to
practice
our
faith
how
we
choose
to
change
our
faith
if
we
choose
to
practice
no
faith
at
all
if
we
choose
and
to
do
so
free
of
persecution
and
fear
and
discrimination
there
wisdom
in
our
founders
writing
in
those
documents
that
help
found
this
nation
the
notion
of
freedom
of
religion
because
they
understood
the
need
for
humility
they
also
understood
the
need
to
uphold
freedom
of
that
there
was
connection
between
freedom
of
and
freedom
of
religion
for
to
infringe
on
one
right
under
the
pretext
of
protecting
another
is
betrayal
of
both
but
part
of
humility
is
also
in
modern
complicated
diverse
societies
the
functioning
of
these
rights
the
concern
for
the
protection
of
these
rights
calls
for
each
of
us
to
exercise
civility
and
restraint
and
judgment
and
if
in
fact
we
defend
the
legal
right
of
person
to
insult
another
religion
we
equally
obligated
to
use
our
free
to
condemn
such
insults
and
stand
with
religious
communities
particularly
religious
minorities
who
are
the
targets
of
such
attacks
just
because
you
have
the
right
to
say
something
does
mean
the
rest
of
us
should
question
those
who
would
insult
others
in
the
name
of
free
because
we
know
that
our
nations
are
stronger
when
people
of
all
faiths
feel
that
they
are
welcome
that
they
too
are
full
and
equal
members
of
our
countries
so
humility
think
is
needed
and
the
second
thing
we
need
is
to
uphold
the
distinction
between
our
faith
and
our
governments
between
church
and
between
state
the
united
states
is
one
of
the
most
religious
countries
in
the
world
far
more
religious
than
most
western
developed
countries
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
our
founders
wisely
embraced
the
separation
of
church
and
state
our
government
does
not
sponsor
religion
nor
does
it
pressure
anyone
to
practice
particular
faith
or
any
faith
at
all
and
the
result
is
culture
where
people
of
all
backgrounds
and
beliefs
can
freely
and
proudly
worship
without
fear
or
coercion
so
that
when
you
listen
to
talk
about
his
faith
journey
you
know
it
real
you
know
he
not
saying
it
because
it
helps
him
advance
or
because
somebody
told
him
to
it
from
the
heart
that
not
the
case
in
theocracies
that
restrict
people
choice
of
faith
it
not
the
case
in
authoritarian
governments
that
elevate
an
individual
leader
or
political
party
above
the
people
or
in
some
cases
above
the
concept
of
god
himself
so
the
freedom
of
religion
is
value
we
will
continue
to
protect
here
at
home
and
stand
up
for
around
the
world
and
is
one
that
we
guard
vigilantly
here
in
the
united
states
last
year
we
joined
together
to
pray
for
the
release
of
christian
missionary
held
in
north
korea
for
two
years
and
today
we
give
thanks
that
is
finally
back
where
he
belongs
home
with
his
family
last
year
we
prayed
together
for
pastor
detained
in
iran
since
and
was
recently
in
idaho
and
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
pastor
beautiful
wife
and
wonderful
children
and
to
convey
to
them
that
our
country
has
not
forgotten
brother
and
that
we
doing
everything
we
can
to
bring
him
home
and
then
received
an
extraordinary
letter
from
pastor
and
in
it
he
describes
his
captivity
and
expressed
his
gratitude
for
my
visit
with
his
family
and
thanked
us
all
for
standing
in
solidarity
with
him
during
his
captivity
and
pastor
wrote
nothing
is
more
valuable
to
the
body
of
christ
than
to
see
how
the
lord
is
in
control
and
moves
ahead
of
countries
and
leadership
through
united
prayer
and
he
closed
his
letter
by
describing
himself
as
prisoner
for
christ
who
is
proud
to
be
part
of
this
great
nation
of
the
united
states
of
america
that
cares
for
religious
freedom
around
the
world
we
going
to
keep
up
this
work
for
pastor
and
all
those
around
the
world
who
are
unjustly
held
or
persecuted
because
of
their
faith
and
we
grateful
to
our
new
for
international
religious
freedom
rabbi
david
who
has
hit
the
ground
running
and
is
heading
to
iraq
in
few
days
to
help
religious
communities
there
address
some
of
those
challenges
where
david
know
he
here
somewhere
thank
you
david
for
the
great
work
you
doing
humility
suspicion
of
government
getting
between
us
and
our
faiths
or
trying
to
dictate
our
faiths
or
elevate
one
faith
over
another
and
finally
let
remember
that
if
there
is
one
law
that
we
can
all
be
most
certain
of
that
seems
to
bind
people
of
all
faiths
and
people
who
are
still
finding
their
way
towards
faith
but
have
sense
of
ethics
and
morality
in
them
that
one
law
that
golden
rule
that
we
should
treat
one
another
as
we
wish
to
be
treated
the
torah
says
love
thy
as
yourself
in
islam
there
is
that
states
none
of
you
truly
believes
until
he
loves
for
his
brother
what
he
loves
for
himself
the
holy
bible
tells
us
to
put
on
love
which
binds
everything
together
in
perfect
harmony
put
on
love
whatever
our
beliefs
whatever
our
traditions
we
must
seek
to
be
instruments
of
peace
and
bringing
light
where
there
is
darkness
and
sowing
love
where
there
is
hatred
and
this
is
the
loving
message
of
his
holiness
pope
and
like
so
many
people
around
the
world
been
touched
by
his
call
to
relieve
suffering
and
to
show
justice
and
mercy
and
compassion
to
the
most
vulnerable
to
walk
with
the
lord
and
ask
who
am
to
judge
he
challenges
us
to
press
on
in
what
he
calls
our
march
of
living
hope
and
like
millions
of
americans
am
very
much
looking
forward
to
welcoming
pope
to
the
united
states
later
this
year
his
holiness
expresses
that
basic
law
treat
thy
as
yourself
the
lama
anybody
who
had
an
opportunity
to
be
with
him
senses
that
same
spirit
kent
expresses
that
same
spirit
kent
was
with
purse
treating
patients
in
liberia
when
he
contracted
the
virus
himself
and
with
medical
care
and
deep
reliance
on
faith
with
god
help
kent
survived
and
then
by
donating
his
plasma
he
helped
others
survive
as
well
and
he
continues
to
advocate
for
global
response
in
west
africa
reminding
us
that
our
efforts
needs
to
be
on
loving
the
people
there
and
could
not
have
been
prouder
to
welcome
kent
and
his
wonderful
wife
amber
to
the
oval
office
we
are
blessed
to
have
him
here
today
because
he
reminds
us
of
what
it
means
to
really
love
thy
as
thyself
not
just
words
but
deeds
each
of
us
has
role
in
fulfilling
our
common
greater
purpose
not
merely
to
seek
high
position
but
to
plumb
greater
depths
so
that
we
may
find
the
strength
to
love
more
fully
and
this
is
perhaps
our
greatest
challenge
to
see
our
own
reflection
in
each
other
to
be
our
brother
keepers
and
sister
keepers
and
to
keep
faith
with
one
another
as
children
of
god
let
make
that
our
work
together
as
children
of
god
let
work
to
end
injustice
injustice
of
poverty
and
hunger
no
one
should
ever
suffer
from
such
want
amidst
such
plenty
as
children
of
god
let
work
to
eliminate
the
scourge
of
homelessness
because
as
sister
mary
says
none
of
us
are
home
until
all
of
us
are
home
none
of
us
are
home
until
all
of
us
are
home
as
children
of
god
let
stand
up
for
the
dignity
and
value
of
every
woman
and
man
and
child
because
we
are
all
equal
in
his
eyes
and
work
to
send
the
scourge
and
the
sin
of
slavery
and
human
trafficking
and
set
the
oppressed
free
if
we
are
properly
humble
if
we
drop
to
our
knees
on
occasion
we
will
acknowledge
that
we
never
fully
know
god
purpose
we
can
never
fully
fathom
his
amazing
grace
we
see
through
glass
darkly
grappling
with
the
expanse
of
his
awesome
love
but
even
with
our
limits
we
can
heed
that
which
is
required
to
do
justice
and
love
kindness
and
walk
humbly
with
our
god
pray
that
we
will
and
as
we
journey
together
on
this
march
of
living
hope
pray
that
in
his
name
we
will
run
and
not
be
weary
and
walk
and
not
be
faint
and
we
heed
those
words
and
put
on
love
may
the
lord
bless
you
and
keep
you
and
may
he
bless
this
precious
country
that
we
love
thank
you
all
very
much
good
afternoon
today
as
part
of
an
international
coalition
of
some
nations
including
arab
countries
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
continue
the
fight
against
in
iraq
and
in
syria
more
than
coalition
have
pounded
these
terrorists
disrupting
their
command
and
control
and
supply
lines
making
it
harder
for
them
to
move
destroying
their
fighting
positions
their
tanks
their
vehicles
their
barracks
their
training
camps
and
the
oil
and
gas
facilities
and
infrastructure
that
fund
their
operations
taking
out
their
commanders
their
fighters
and
their
leaders
in
iraq
local
forces
have
largely
held
the
line
and
in
some
places
have
pushed
back
in
syria
failed
in
its
major
push
to
take
the
town
of
losing
countless
fighters
in
the
process
fighters
who
will
never
again
threaten
innocent
civilians
and
seen
reports
of
sinking
morale
among
fighters
as
they
the
futility
of
their
cause
now
make
no
mistake
this
is
difficult
mission
and
it
will
remain
difficult
for
some
time
going
to
take
time
to
dislodge
these
terrorists
especially
from
urban
areas
but
our
coalition
is
on
the
offensive
is
on
the
defensive
and
is
going
to
lose
its
barbaric
murders
of
so
many
people
including
american
hostages
are
desperate
and
revolting
attempt
to
strike
fear
in
the
hearts
of
people
it
can
never
possibly
win
over
by
its
ideas
or
its
ideology
because
it
offers
nothing
but
misery
and
death
and
destruction
and
with
vile
groups
like
this
there
is
only
one
option
with
our
allies
and
partners
we
are
going
to
degrade
and
ultimately
destroy
this
terrorist
group
and
when
announced
our
strategy
against
in
september
said
that
we
are
strongest
as
nation
when
the
president
and
congress
work
together
today
my
administration
submitted
draft
resolution
to
congress
to
the
use
of
force
against
want
to
be
very
clear
about
what
it
does
and
what
it
does
not
do
this
resolution
reflects
our
core
objective
to
destroy
it
supports
the
comprehensive
strategy
that
we
have
been
pursuing
with
our
allies
and
partners
systemic
and
sustained
campaign
of
against
in
iraq
and
syria
support
and
training
for
local
forces
on
the
ground
including
the
moderate
syrian
opposition
preventing
attacks
in
the
region
and
beyond
including
by
foreign
terrorist
fighters
who
try
to
threaten
our
countries
regional
and
international
support
for
an
inclusive
iraqi
government
that
unites
the
iraqi
people
and
strengthens
iraqi
forces
against
humanitarian
assistance
for
the
innocent
civilians
of
iraq
and
syria
who
are
suffering
so
terribly
under
reign
of
horror
want
to
thank
vice
president
secretaries
and
and
general
for
their
leadership
in
advancing
our
strategy
even
as
we
meet
this
challenge
in
iraq
and
syria
we
all
agree
that
one
of
our
weapons
against
terrorists
like
critical
part
of
our
strategy
is
the
values
we
live
here
at
home
one
of
the
best
antidotes
to
the
hateful
ideologies
that
try
to
recruit
and
people
to
violent
extremism
is
our
own
example
as
diverse
and
tolerant
societies
that
welcome
the
contributions
of
all
people
including
people
of
all
faiths
the
resolution
submitted
today
does
not
call
for
the
deployment
of
ground
combat
forces
to
iraq
or
syria
it
is
not
the
of
another
ground
war
like
or
iraq
the
american
troops
in
iraq
today
largely
serve
on
bases
and
yes
they
face
the
risks
that
come
with
service
in
any
dangerous
environment
but
they
do
not
have
combat
mission
they
are
focused
on
training
iraqi
forces
including
forces
as
said
before
convinced
that
the
united
states
should
not
get
dragged
back
into
another
prolonged
ground
war
in
the
middle
east
not
in
our
national
security
interest
and
not
necessary
for
us
to
defeat
local
forces
on
the
ground
who
know
their
countries
best
are
best
positioned
to
take
the
ground
fight
to
and
what
doing
at
the
same
time
this
resolution
strikes
the
necessary
balance
by
giving
us
the
flexibility
we
need
for
unforeseen
circumstances
for
example
if
we
had
actionable
intelligence
about
gathering
of
leaders
and
our
partners
have
the
capacity
to
get
them
would
be
prepared
to
order
our
special
forces
to
take
action
because
will
not
allow
these
terrorists
to
have
safe
haven
so
we
need
flexibility
but
we
also
have
to
be
careful
and
deliberate
and
there
is
no
heavier
decision
than
asking
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
to
risk
their
lives
on
our
behalf
as
commander
in
chief
will
only
send
our
troops
into
way
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
our
national
security
finally
this
resolution
repeals
the
of
force
for
the
invasion
of
iraq
and
limits
this
new
to
three
years
do
not
believe
interests
are
served
by
endless
war
or
by
remaining
on
perpetual
war
footing
as
nation
we
need
to
ask
the
difficult
and
necessary
questions
about
when
why
and
how
we
use
military
force
after
all
it
is
our
troops
who
bear
the
costs
of
our
decisions
and
we
owe
them
clear
strategy
and
the
support
they
need
to
get
the
job
done
so
this
resolution
will
give
our
armed
forces
and
our
coalition
the
continuity
we
need
for
the
next
three
years
it
is
not
timetable
it
is
not
announcing
that
the
mission
is
completed
at
any
given
period
what
it
is
saying
is
that
congress
should
revisit
the
issue
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
term
conceivable
that
the
mission
is
completed
earlier
conceivable
that
after
deliberation
debate
and
evaluation
that
there
are
additional
tasks
to
be
carried
out
in
this
area
and
the
representatives
with
new
president
should
be
able
to
have
that
discussion
in
closing
want
to
say
that
in
crafting
this
resolution
we
have
consulted
with
and
listened
to
both
republicans
and
democrats
in
congress
we
have
made
sincere
effort
to
address
difficult
issues
that
discussed
together
in
the
days
and
weeks
ahead
continue
to
work
closely
with
leaders
and
members
of
congress
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
believe
this
resolution
can
grow
even
stronger
with
the
thoughtful
and
dignified
debate
that
this
moment
demands
optimistic
that
it
can
win
strong
bipartisan
support
and
that
we
can
show
our
troops
and
the
world
that
americans
are
united
in
this
mission
today
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
continue
the
fight
against
and
we
salute
them
for
their
courageous
service
we
pray
for
their
safety
we
stand
with
their
families
who
miss
them
and
who
are
sacrificing
here
at
home
but
know
this
our
coalition
is
strong
our
cause
is
just
and
our
mission
will
succeed
and
long
after
the
terrorists
we
face
today
are
destroyed
and
forgotten
america
will
continue
to
stand
free
and
tall
and
strong
may
god
bless
our
troops
and
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
everybody
first
of
all
let
me
thank
president
for
not
just
the
introduction
but
for
your
outstanding
leadership
at
one
of
the
great
universities
of
the
world
got
to
admit
like
kind
of
want
to
go
here
was
trying
to
figure
out
why
it
is
that
really
nice
place
like
this
is
wasted
on
young
people
who
fully
appreciate
what
you
got
really
nice
and
everybody
here
is
so
friendly
and
smart
and
beautiful
and
there
not
to
like
want
to
thank
you
and
everyone
at
for
hosting
this
summit
especially
george
and
someone
who
served
as
great
to
me
at
the
white
house
and
as
an
outstanding
ambassador
to
russia
before
coming
back
to
the
farm
mike
it
is
great
to
be
here
at
junior
university
and
pleased
to
be
joined
by
members
of
my
team
who
bleed
cardinal
red
infiltrated
with
people
got
senior
national
security
rice
secretary
of
commerce
penny
and
face
it
like
noticed
was
around
here
who
helped
lead
our
energy
department
for
while
and
now
hanging
out
also
pleased
to
be
joined
by
other
members
of
my
cabinet
our
secretary
of
homeland
security
is
here
and
our
small
business
administrator
maria
and
want
to
acknowledge
my
tireless
homeland
security
who
helped
and
continues
to
shape
our
efforts
monaco
thank
you
so
always
heard
about
this
campus
and
everybody
is
riding
bikes
and
people
hopping
into
fountains
and
the
current
holder
of
the
axe
this
is
the
place
that
made
cool
was
thinking
about
wearing
some
glasses
some
tape
in
the
middle
but
guess
not
what
you
do
anymore
ambassador
told
me
if
came
to
to
but
not
just
here
to
enjoy
myself
as
we
gather
here
today
america
is
seeing
incredible
progress
that
we
can
all
be
proud
of
we
just
had
the
best
year
of
job
growth
since
the
over
the
past
months
our
businesses
have
created
nearly
million
new
jobs
which
is
the
longest
streak
of
private
sector
job
growth
on
record
and
in
hopeful
sign
for
families
wages
are
beginning
to
rise
again
and
meanwhile
doing
more
to
prepare
our
young
people
for
competitive
world
our
high
school
graduation
rate
has
hit
an
high
more
americans
are
finishing
college
than
ever
before
here
at
and
across
the
country
got
the
best
universities
got
the
best
scientists
the
best
researchers
in
the
world
got
the
most
dynamic
economy
in
the
world
and
no
place
represents
that
better
than
this
region
so
make
no
mistake
more
than
any
other
nation
on
earth
the
united
states
is
positioned
to
lead
in
the
century
and
so
much
of
our
economic
competitiveness
is
tied
to
what
brings
me
here
today
and
that
is
leadership
in
the
digital
economy
our
ability
almost
unique
across
the
planet
our
ability
to
innovate
and
to
learn
and
to
discover
and
to
create
and
build
and
do
business
and
stretch
the
boundaries
of
possible
what
drives
us
and
so
when
we
had
to
decide
where
to
have
this
summit
the
decision
was
easy
because
so
much
of
our
information
age
began
right
here
at
it
was
here
where
two
students
bill
and
met
and
then
in
garage
not
far
from
here
started
company
that
eventually
built
one
of
the
first
personal
computers
weighing
in
at
pounds
it
was
from
here
in
where
researcher
astonished
an
audience
with
two
computers
connected
and
hypertext
you
could
click
on
with
something
called
year
later
computer
here
received
the
first
message
from
another
computer
miles
away
the
beginnings
of
what
would
become
the
internet
and
by
the
way
no
secret
that
many
of
these
innovations
built
on
research
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
if
we
want
to
maintain
our
economic
leadership
in
the
world
america
has
to
keep
investing
in
basic
research
in
science
and
technology
it
absolutely
critical
so
here
at
pioneers
developed
the
protocols
and
architecture
of
the
internet
the
first
in
america
innovations
for
cloud
computing
student
projects
here
became
and
those
were
pretty
good
student
projects
your
graduates
have
gone
on
to
help
create
and
build
thousands
of
companies
that
have
shaped
our
digital
society
from
to
sun
to
according
to
one
study
if
all
the
companies
traced
back
to
graduates
formed
their
own
nation
be
one
the
largest
economies
in
the
world
and
have
pretty
good
football
team
as
well
and
today
with
your
research
programs
and
your
new
initiatives
helping
us
navigate
some
of
the
most
complicated
challenges
that
we
face
as
nation
and
why
here
want
to
thank
all
of
you
who
have
joined
us
today
members
of
congress
representatives
from
the
private
sector
government
academia
privacy
and
consumer
groups
and
especially
the
students
who
are
here
just
as
all
connected
like
never
before
we
have
to
work
together
like
never
before
both
to
seize
opportunities
but
also
meet
the
challenges
of
this
information
age
and
one
of
the
great
paradoxes
of
our
time
that
the
very
technologies
that
empower
us
to
do
great
good
can
also
be
used
to
undermine
us
and
inflict
great
harm
the
same
information
technologies
that
help
make
our
military
the
most
advanced
in
the
world
are
targeted
by
hackers
from
china
and
russia
who
go
after
our
contractors
and
systems
that
are
built
for
our
troops
the
same
social
media
we
use
in
government
to
advocate
for
democracy
and
human
rights
around
the
world
can
also
be
used
by
terrorists
to
spread
hateful
ideologies
so
these
threats
are
challenge
to
our
national
security
much
of
our
critical
infrastructure
our
financial
systems
our
power
grid
health
systems
run
on
networks
connected
to
the
internet
which
is
hugely
empowering
but
also
dangerous
and
creates
new
points
of
vulnerability
that
we
have
before
foreign
governments
and
criminals
are
probing
these
systems
every
single
day
we
only
have
to
think
of
examples
an
air
traffic
control
system
going
down
and
disrupting
flights
or
blackouts
that
plunge
cities
into
darkness
to
imagine
what
set
of
systematic
attacks
might
do
so
this
is
also
matter
of
public
safety
as
nation
we
do
more
business
than
ever
before
trillions
of
dollars
year
and
industries
like
those
across
the
valley
support
millions
of
american
jobs
all
this
gives
us
an
enormous
competitive
advantage
in
the
global
economy
and
for
that
very
reason
american
companies
are
being
targeted
their
trade
secrets
stolen
intellectual
property
ripped
off
the
north
korean
attack
on
pictures
destroyed
data
and
disabled
thousands
of
computers
and
exposed
the
personal
information
of
employees
and
these
attacks
are
hurting
american
companies
and
costing
american
jobs
so
this
is
also
threat
to
economic
security
as
consumers
we
do
more
than
ever
before
we
manage
our
bank
accounts
we
shop
we
pay
our
bills
we
handle
our
medical
records
and
as
country
one
of
our
greatest
resources
are
the
young
people
who
are
here
today
digitally
fearless
and
unencumbered
by
convention
and
uninterested
in
old
debates
and
remaking
the
world
every
day
but
it
also
means
that
this
problem
of
how
we
secure
this
digital
world
is
only
going
to
increase
want
more
americans
succeeding
in
our
digital
world
want
young
people
like
you
to
unleash
the
next
waves
of
innovation
and
launch
the
next
startups
and
give
americans
the
tools
to
create
new
jobs
and
new
businesses
and
to
expand
connectivity
in
places
that
we
currently
imagine
to
help
open
up
new
world
and
new
experiences
and
empower
individuals
in
ways
that
would
seem
unimaginable
years
ago
and
why
working
to
connect
percent
of
students
to
internet
because
when
it
comes
to
educating
our
children
we
afford
any
digital
divides
why
helping
more
communities
get
across
to
the
next
generation
of
broadband
faster
with
cheaper
internet
so
that
students
and
entrepreneurs
and
small
businesses
across
america
not
just
in
pockets
of
america
have
the
same
opportunities
to
learn
and
compete
as
you
do
here
in
the
valley
why
come
out
so
strongly
and
publicly
for
net
neutrality
for
an
open
and
free
internet
because
we
have
to
preserve
one
of
the
greatest
engines
for
creativity
and
innovation
in
human
history
so
our
connectivity
brings
extraordinary
benefits
to
our
daily
lives
but
it
also
brings
risks
and
when
companies
get
hacked
personal
information
including
their
financial
information
gets
stolen
identity
theft
can
ruin
your
credit
rating
and
turn
your
life
upside
down
in
recent
breaches
more
than
million
americans
had
their
personal
data
compromised
including
in
some
cases
credit
card
information
we
want
our
children
to
go
and
explore
the
world
but
we
also
want
them
to
be
safe
and
not
have
their
privacy
violated
so
this
is
direct
threat
to
the
economic
security
of
american
families
not
just
the
economy
overall
and
to
the
wellbeing
of
our
children
which
means
got
to
put
in
place
mechanisms
to
protect
them
so
shortly
after
took
office
before
had
hair
said
that
these
threats
were
one
of
the
most
serious
economic
national
security
challenges
that
we
face
as
nation
and
made
confronting
them
priority
and
given
the
complexity
of
these
threats
believe
we
have
to
be
guided
by
some
basic
principles
so
let
me
share
those
with
you
today
first
this
has
to
be
shared
mission
so
much
of
our
computer
networks
and
critical
infrastructure
are
in
the
private
sector
which
means
government
can
not
do
this
alone
but
the
fact
is
that
the
private
sector
do
it
alone
either
because
government
that
often
has
the
latest
information
on
new
threats
only
one
way
to
defend
america
from
these
threats
and
that
is
through
government
and
industry
working
together
sharing
appropriate
information
as
true
partners
second
we
have
to
focus
on
our
unique
strengths
government
has
many
capabilities
but
not
appropriate
or
even
possible
for
government
to
secure
the
computer
networks
of
private
businesses
many
of
the
companies
who
are
here
today
are
but
the
private
sector
always
have
the
capabilities
needed
during
attack
the
situational
awareness
or
the
ability
to
warn
other
companies
in
real
time
or
the
capacity
to
coordinate
response
across
companies
and
sectors
so
going
to
have
to
be
smart
and
efficient
and
focus
on
what
each
sector
does
best
and
then
do
it
together
third
going
to
have
to
constantly
evolve
the
first
computer
viruses
hit
personal
computers
in
the
early
and
essentially
been
in
arms
race
ever
since
we
design
new
defenses
and
then
hackers
and
criminals
design
new
ways
to
penetrate
them
whether
or
or
and
now
these
attacks
are
getting
more
and
more
sophisticated
every
day
so
got
to
be
just
as
fast
and
flexible
and
nimble
in
constantly
evolving
our
defenses
and
fourth
and
most
importantly
in
all
our
work
we
have
to
make
sure
we
are
protecting
the
privacy
and
civil
liberty
of
the
american
people
and
we
grapple
with
these
issues
in
government
pursued
important
reforms
to
make
sure
we
are
respecting
privacy
as
well
as
ensuring
our
national
security
and
the
private
sector
wrestles
with
this
as
well
when
consumers
share
their
personal
information
with
companies
they
deserve
to
know
that
going
to
be
protected
when
government
and
industry
share
information
about
threats
got
to
do
so
in
way
that
safeguards
your
personal
information
when
people
go
we
have
to
forfeit
the
basic
privacy
entitled
to
as
americans
in
recent
years
worked
to
put
these
principles
into
practice
and
as
part
of
our
comprehensive
strategy
boosted
our
defenses
in
government
sharing
more
information
with
the
private
sector
to
help
those
companies
defend
themselves
working
with
industry
to
use
what
we
call
framework
to
prevent
respond
to
and
recover
from
attacks
when
they
happen
and
by
the
way
recently
went
to
the
national
communications
integration
which
is
part
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
where
representatives
from
government
and
the
private
sector
monitor
threats
and
so
defending
against
threats
just
like
terrorism
or
other
threats
is
one
more
reason
that
we
are
calling
on
congress
not
to
engage
in
politics
this
is
not
republican
or
democratic
issue
but
work
to
make
sure
that
our
security
is
safeguarded
and
that
we
fully
fund
the
department
of
homeland
security
because
it
has
great
responsibilities
in
this
area
so
making
progress
and
recently
announced
new
actions
to
keep
up
this
momentum
called
for
single
national
standard
so
americans
know
within
days
if
your
information
has
been
stolen
this
month
be
proposing
legislation
that
we
call
consumer
privacy
bill
of
rights
to
give
americans
some
baseline
protections
like
the
right
to
decide
what
personal
data
companies
collect
from
you
and
the
right
to
know
how
companies
are
using
that
information
proposed
the
student
digital
privacy
act
which
is
on
the
landmark
law
here
in
california
because
amazing
educational
technologies
should
be
used
to
teach
our
students
and
not
collect
data
for
marketing
to
students
and
also
taken
new
steps
to
strengthen
our
proposing
new
legislation
to
promote
greater
information
sharing
between
government
and
the
private
sector
including
liability
protections
for
companies
that
share
information
about
threats
today
once
again
calling
on
congress
to
come
together
and
get
this
done
and
this
week
we
announced
the
creation
of
our
new
threat
intelligence
integration
just
like
we
do
with
terrorist
threats
going
to
have
single
entity
and
integrating
and
quickly
sharing
intelligence
about
threats
across
government
so
we
can
act
on
all
those
threats
even
faster
and
today
taking
an
additional
step
which
is
why
desk
here
you
were
wondering
sure
signing
new
executive
order
to
promote
even
more
information
sharing
about
threats
both
within
the
private
sector
and
between
government
and
the
private
sector
and
it
will
encourage
more
companies
and
industries
to
set
up
hubs
so
you
can
share
information
with
each
other
it
will
call
for
common
set
of
standards
including
protections
for
privacy
and
civil
liberties
so
that
government
can
share
threat
information
with
these
hubs
more
easily
and
it
can
help
make
it
easier
for
companies
to
get
the
classified
threat
information
that
they
need
to
protect
their
companies
want
to
acknowledge
by
the
way
that
the
companies
who
are
represented
here
are
stepping
up
as
well
the
threat
alliance
which
includes
companies
like
alto
networks
and
are
going
to
work
with
us
to
share
more
information
under
this
new
executive
order
got
companies
from
apple
to
from
bank
of
america
to
who
are
going
to
use
the
framework
to
strengthen
their
own
defenses
as
part
of
our
initiative
visa
and
and
american
express
and
others
are
going
to
make
their
transactions
more
secure
is
joining
companies
that
are
giving
their
companies
customers
another
weapon
to
battle
identity
theft
and
that
free
access
to
their
credit
scores
and
more
companies
are
moving
to
new
stronger
technologies
to
authenticate
user
identities
like
biometrics
because
just
too
easy
for
hackers
to
figure
out
and
passwords
like
or
those
are
some
of
my
previous
passwords
changed
them
since
then
so
this
summit
is
an
example
of
what
we
need
more
of
all
of
us
working
together
to
do
what
none
of
us
can
achieve
alone
and
it
is
difficult
some
of
the
challenges
described
today
have
defied
solutions
for
years
and
want
to
say
very
clearly
that
as
somebody
who
is
former
constitutional
law
teacher
and
somebody
who
deeply
values
his
privacy
and
his
privacy
although
chose
the
wrong
job
for
that
but
will
be
private
citizen
again
and
cares
deeply
about
this
have
to
tell
you
that
grappling
with
how
government
protects
the
american
people
from
adverse
events
while
at
the
same
time
making
sure
that
government
itself
is
not
abusing
its
capabilities
is
hard
the
world
is
sort
of
the
wild
wild
west
and
to
some
degree
we
asked
to
be
the
sheriff
when
something
like
happens
people
want
to
know
what
can
government
do
about
this
if
information
is
being
shared
by
terrorists
in
the
world
and
an
attack
happens
people
want
to
know
are
there
ways
of
stopping
that
from
happening
by
necessity
that
means
government
has
its
own
significant
capabilities
in
the
world
but
then
people
rightly
ask
well
what
safeguards
do
we
have
against
government
intruding
on
our
own
privacy
and
it
hard
and
it
constantly
evolves
because
the
technology
so
often
outstrips
whatever
rules
and
structures
and
standards
have
been
put
in
place
which
means
that
government
has
to
be
constantly
and
we
have
to
be
able
to
have
an
open
debate
about
it
but
all
here
today
because
we
know
that
we
going
to
have
to
break
through
some
of
these
barriers
that
are
holding
us
back
if
we
are
going
to
continue
to
thrive
in
this
remarkable
new
world
we
all
know
what
we
need
to
do
we
have
to
build
stronger
defenses
and
disrupt
more
attacks
we
have
to
make
cyberspace
safer
we
have
to
improve
cooperation
across
the
board
and
by
the
way
this
is
not
just
here
in
america
but
internationally
which
also
by
the
way
makes
things
complicated
because
lot
of
countries
do
necessarily
share
our
investment
or
our
commitment
to
openness
and
we
have
to
try
to
navigate
that
but
this
should
not
be
an
ideological
issue
and
one
thing
want
to
this
is
not
democratic
issue
or
republican
issue
this
is
not
liberal
or
conservative
issue
everybody
is
and
everybody
is
vulnerable
the
business
leaders
here
want
their
privacy
and
their
children
protected
just
like
the
consumer
and
privacy
advocates
here
want
america
to
keep
leading
the
world
in
technology
and
be
safe
from
attacks
so
hopeful
that
through
this
forum
and
the
work
that
we
do
subsequently
that
we
able
to
generate
ideas
and
best
practices
and
that
the
work
of
this
summit
can
help
guide
our
planning
and
execution
for
years
to
come
after
all
we
are
just
getting
started
think
about
it
from
his
lab
in
invented
the
world
wide
web
in
which
was
only
years
ago
the
great
epochs
in
human
history
the
bronze
age
iron
age
agricultural
revolution
industrial
revolution
they
spanned
centuries
only
years
into
this
internet
age
only
scratched
the
surface
and
as
guess
they
say
at
future
is
we
even
begun
to
imagine
the
discoveries
and
innovations
that
are
going
to
be
unleashed
in
the
decades
to
come
but
we
know
how
get
there
reflecting
on
his
work
in
the
on
the
precursor
of
the
internet
the
late
paul
said
this
process
of
technological
developments
is
like
building
cathedral
over
the
course
of
several
hundred
years
new
people
come
along
and
each
lays
down
block
on
top
of
the
old
foundations
each
saying
built
the
and
then
comes
along
an
historian
who
asks
who
built
the
cathedral
and
said
not
careful
you
can
con
yourself
into
believing
that
you
did
the
most
important
part
but
the
reality
is
that
each
contribution
has
to
follow
on
to
previous
work
everything
is
tied
to
everything
everything
is
tied
to
everything
else
the
innovations
that
first
appeared
on
this
campus
all
those
decades
ago
that
first
mouse
that
first
message
helped
lay
foundation
and
in
the
decades
since
on
campuses
like
this
in
companies
like
those
that
are
represented
here
new
people
have
come
along
each
laying
down
block
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
when
future
historians
ask
who
built
this
information
age
it
be
any
one
of
us
who
did
the
most
important
part
alone
the
answer
will
be
all
did
as
and
absolutely
confident
that
if
we
keep
at
this
if
we
keep
working
together
in
spirit
of
collaboration
like
all
those
innovators
before
us
our
work
will
endure
like
great
cathedral
for
centuries
to
come
and
that
cathedral
will
not
just
be
about
technology
it
will
be
about
the
values
that
embedded
in
the
architecture
of
this
system
it
will
be
about
privacy
and
it
will
be
about
community
and
it
will
be
about
connection
what
magnificent
cathedral
that
all
of
you
have
helped
to
build
we
want
to
be
part
of
that
and
we
look
forward
to
working
with
you
in
the
future
thank
you
for
your
partnership
with
that
going
to
sign
this
executive
order
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
everybody
please
have
seat
well
thank
you
for
the
introduction
is
an
example
of
the
countless
dedicated
public
servants
across
our
government
number
of
who
are
here
today
who
are
working
tirelessly
every
single
day
on
behalf
of
the
security
and
safety
of
the
american
people
so
we
very
much
appreciate
her
and
thanks
to
all
of
you
for
your
attendance
and
participation
in
this
important
summit
for
more
than
years
the
united
states
of
america
has
not
just
endured
but
we
have
thrived
and
surmounted
challenges
that
might
have
broken
lesser
nation
after
terrible
civil
war
we
repaired
our
union
we
weathered
great
depression
became
the
most
dynamic
economy
we
fought
fascism
liberated
europe
we
faced
down
communism
and
won
american
communities
have
been
destroyed
by
earthquakes
and
and
fires
and
floods
and
each
time
we
rebuild
the
bombing
that
killed
people
could
not
break
oklahoma
city
on
terrorists
tried
to
bring
us
to
our
knees
today
new
tower
soars
above
new
york
city
and
america
continues
to
lead
throughout
the
world
after
americans
were
killed
at
fort
hood
and
the
boston
marathon
it
divide
us
we
came
together
as
one
american
family
in
the
face
of
horrific
acts
of
violence
at
temple
near
or
at
jewish
community
outside
city
we
reaffirmed
our
commitment
to
pluralism
and
to
freedom
repulsed
by
the
notion
that
anyone
should
ever
be
targeted
because
of
who
they
are
or
what
they
look
like
or
how
they
worship
most
recently
with
the
brutal
murders
in
chapel
hill
of
three
young
muslim
americans
many
muslim
americans
are
worried
and
afraid
and
want
to
be
as
clear
as
can
be
as
americans
all
faiths
and
backgrounds
we
stand
with
you
in
your
grief
and
we
offer
our
love
and
we
offer
our
support
my
point
is
this
as
americans
we
are
strong
and
we
are
resilient
and
when
tragedy
strikes
when
we
take
hit
we
pull
together
and
we
draw
on
best
in
our
character
our
optimism
our
commitment
to
each
other
our
commitment
to
our
values
our
respect
for
one
another
we
stand
up
and
we
rebuild
and
we
recover
and
we
emerge
stronger
than
before
who
we
are
and
say
all
this
because
we
face
genuine
challenges
to
our
security
today
just
as
we
have
throughout
our
history
challenges
to
our
security
are
not
new
they
happen
yesterday
or
week
ago
or
year
ago
we
always
faced
challenges
one
of
those
challenges
is
the
terrorist
threat
from
groups
like
and
but
this
is
our
challenge
alone
it
challenge
for
the
world
is
the
people
of
syria
and
iraq
and
burns
human
beings
in
unfathomable
acts
of
cruelty
seen
deadly
attacks
in
and
sydney
and
paris
and
now
so
in
the
face
of
this
challenge
we
have
the
full
force
of
the
united
states
government
and
working
with
allies
and
partners
to
dismantle
terrorist
and
protect
the
american
people
given
the
complexities
of
the
challenge
and
the
nature
of
the
enemy
which
is
not
traditional
army
this
work
takes
time
and
will
require
vigilance
and
resilience
and
perspective
but
confident
that
just
as
we
have
for
more
than
two
centuries
we
will
ultimately
prevail
and
part
of
what
gives
me
that
confidence
is
the
overwhelming
response
of
the
world
community
to
the
savagery
of
these
terrorists
not
just
revulsion
but
concrete
commitment
to
work
together
to
vanquish
these
at
the
united
nations
in
september
called
on
the
international
community
to
come
together
and
eradicate
this
scourge
of
violent
extremism
and
want
to
thank
all
of
you
from
across
america
and
around
the
world
for
answering
this
call
tomorrow
at
the
state
department
governments
and
civil
society
groups
from
more
than
countries
will
focus
on
the
steps
that
we
can
take
as
governments
and
also
speak
about
how
our
nations
have
to
remain
relentless
in
our
fight
our
efforts
against
groups
that
are
plotting
against
our
counties
but
we
are
here
today
because
of
very
specific
challenge
and
countering
violent
extremism
something
that
is
not
just
matter
of
military
affairs
by
violent
extremism
we
just
mean
the
terrorists
who
are
killing
innocent
people
we
also
mean
the
ideologies
the
infrastructure
of
extremists
the
propagandists
the
recruiters
the
who
and
recruit
or
incite
people
to
violence
we
all
know
there
is
no
one
profile
of
violent
extremist
or
terrorist
so
no
way
to
predict
who
will
become
around
the
world
and
here
in
the
united
states
inexcusable
acts
of
violence
have
been
committed
against
people
of
different
faiths
by
people
of
different
faiths
which
is
of
course
betrayal
of
all
our
faiths
it
not
unique
to
one
group
or
to
one
geography
or
one
period
of
time
but
we
are
here
at
this
summit
because
of
the
urgent
threat
from
groups
like
and
and
this
week
we
are
focused
on
prevention
preventing
these
groups
from
recruiting
or
inspiring
others
to
violence
in
the
first
place
called
upon
governments
to
come
to
the
united
nations
this
fall
with
concrete
steps
that
we
can
take
together
and
today
what
want
to
do
is
suggest
several
areas
where
believe
we
can
concentrate
our
efforts
first
we
have
to
confront
squarely
and
honestly
the
twisted
ideologies
that
these
terrorist
groups
use
to
incite
people
to
violence
leading
up
to
this
summit
been
fair
amount
of
debate
in
the
press
and
among
pundits
about
the
words
we
use
to
describe
and
frame
this
challenge
so
want
to
be
very
clear
about
how
see
it
and
and
groups
like
it
are
desperate
for
legitimacy
they
try
to
portray
themselves
as
religious
leaders
holy
warriors
in
of
islam
why
presumes
to
declare
itself
the
islamic
state
and
they
propagate
the
notion
that
america
and
the
west
generally
is
at
war
with
islam
how
they
recruit
how
they
try
to
young
people
we
must
never
accept
the
premise
that
they
put
forward
because
it
is
lie
nor
should
we
grant
these
terrorists
the
religious
legitimacy
that
they
seek
they
are
not
religious
leaders
terrorists
and
we
are
not
at
war
with
islam
we
are
at
war
with
people
who
have
perverted
islam
now
just
as
those
of
us
outside
muslim
communities
need
to
reject
the
terrorist
narrative
that
the
west
and
islam
are
in
conflict
or
modern
life
and
islam
are
in
conflict
also
believe
that
muslim
communities
have
responsibility
as
well
and
do
draw
selectively
from
the
islamic
texts
they
do
depend
upon
the
around
the
world
that
they
speak
in
some
fashion
for
people
of
the
muslim
faith
that
islam
is
somehow
inherently
violent
that
there
is
some
sort
of
clash
of
of
course
the
terrorists
do
not
speak
for
over
billion
muslims
who
reject
their
hateful
ideology
they
no
more
represent
islam
than
any
madman
who
kills
innocents
in
the
name
of
god
represents
or
judaism
or
buddhism
or
hinduism
no
religion
is
responsible
for
terrorism
people
are
responsible
for
violence
and
terrorism
and
to
their
credit
there
are
respected
muslim
clerics
and
scholars
not
just
here
in
the
united
states
but
around
the
world
who
push
back
on
this
twisted
interpretation
of
their
faith
they
want
to
make
very
clear
what
islam
stands
for
and
joined
by
some
of
these
leaders
today
these
religious
leaders
and
scholars
preach
that
islam
calls
for
peace
and
for
justice
and
tolerance
toward
others
that
terrorism
is
prohibited
that
the
koran
says
whoever
kills
an
innocent
it
is
as
if
he
has
killed
all
mankind
those
are
the
voices
that
represent
over
billion
people
around
the
world
but
if
we
are
going
to
effectively
isolate
terrorists
if
we
going
to
address
the
challenge
of
their
efforts
to
recruit
our
young
people
if
we
going
to
lift
up
the
voices
of
tolerance
and
pluralism
within
the
muslim
community
then
we
got
to
acknowledge
that
their
job
is
made
harder
by
broader
narrative
that
does
exist
in
many
muslim
communities
around
the
world
that
suggests
the
west
is
at
odds
with
islam
in
some
fashion
the
reality
which
again
many
muslim
leaders
have
spoken
to
is
that
strain
of
thought
that
embrace
tactics
embrace
violence
but
does
buy
into
the
notion
that
the
muslim
world
has
suffered
historical
grievances
sometimes
that
accurate
does
buy
into
the
belief
that
so
many
of
the
ills
in
the
middle
east
flow
from
history
of
colonialism
or
conspiracy
does
buy
into
the
idea
that
islam
is
incompatible
with
modernity
or
tolerance
or
that
it
been
polluted
by
western
values
so
those
beliefs
exist
in
some
communities
around
the
world
they
are
widespread
and
so
it
makes
individuals
especially
young
people
who
already
may
be
disaffected
or
alienated
more
ripe
for
and
so
we
got
to
be
able
to
talk
honestly
about
those
issues
we
got
to
be
much
more
clear
about
how
we
rejecting
certain
ideas
so
just
as
leaders
like
myself
reject
the
notion
that
terrorists
like
genuinely
represent
islam
muslim
leaders
need
to
do
more
to
discredit
the
notion
that
our
nations
are
determined
to
suppress
islam
that
an
inherent
clash
in
everybody
has
to
speak
up
very
clearly
that
no
matter
what
the
grievance
violence
against
innocents
does
defend
islam
or
muslims
it
damages
islam
and
muslims
and
when
all
of
us
together
are
doing
our
part
to
reject
the
narratives
of
violent
extremists
when
all
of
us
are
doing
our
part
to
be
very
clear
about
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
universal
precepts
and
values
that
need
to
be
respected
in
this
interconnected
world
the
beginnings
of
partnership
as
we
go
forward
we
need
to
find
new
ways
to
amplify
the
voices
of
peace
and
tolerance
and
inclusion
and
we
especially
need
to
do
it
we
also
need
to
lift
up
the
voices
of
those
who
know
the
hypocrisy
of
groups
like
firsthand
including
former
extremists
their
words
speak
to
us
today
and
know
in
some
of
the
discussions
these
voices
have
been
raised
witnessed
horrible
crimes
committed
by
isis
not
revolution
or
was
shocked
by
what
did
this
what
we
came
for
to
kill
other
muslims
is
this
the
only
future
able
to
imagine
that
the
voice
of
so
many
who
were
temporarily
and
then
saw
the
truth
and
warned
other
young
people
not
to
make
the
same
mistakes
as
they
did
do
not
run
after
illusions
do
not
be
deceived
do
not
give
up
your
life
for
nothing
we
need
to
lift
up
those
voices
and
in
all
this
work
the
greatest
resource
are
communities
themselves
especially
like
those
young
people
who
are
here
today
we
are
joined
by
talented
young
men
and
women
who
are
pioneering
new
innovations
and
new
social
media
tools
and
new
ways
to
reach
young
people
joined
by
leaders
from
the
private
sector
including
companies
who
want
to
support
your
efforts
and
want
to
challenge
all
of
us
to
build
new
partnerships
that
unleash
the
talents
and
creativity
of
young
people
young
muslims
not
just
to
expose
the
lies
of
extremists
but
to
empower
youth
to
service
and
to
lift
up
lives
here
in
america
and
around
the
world
and
that
can
be
calling
for
your
generation
so
the
first
challenge
we
got
to
discredit
these
ideologies
we
have
to
tackle
them
head
on
and
we
shy
away
from
these
discussions
and
too
often
folks
are
understandably
sensitive
about
addressing
some
of
these
root
issues
but
we
have
to
talk
about
them
honestly
and
clearly
and
the
reason
believe
we
have
to
do
so
is
because
so
confident
that
when
the
truth
is
out
we
be
successful
now
second
challenge
is
we
do
have
to
address
the
grievances
that
terrorists
exploit
including
economic
grievances
poverty
alone
does
not
cause
person
to
become
terrorist
any
more
than
poverty
alone
causes
somebody
to
become
criminal
there
are
millions
of
people
billions
of
people
in
the
world
who
live
in
abject
poverty
and
are
focused
on
what
they
can
do
to
build
up
their
own
lives
and
never
embrace
violent
ideologies
conversely
there
are
terrorists
come
from
extraordinarily
wealthy
backgrounds
like
bin
laden
true
though
is
that
when
millions
of
people
especially
youth
are
impoverished
and
have
no
hope
for
the
future
when
corruption
inflicts
daily
humiliations
on
people
when
there
are
no
outlets
by
which
people
can
express
their
concerns
resentments
fester
the
risk
of
instability
and
extremism
grow
where
young
people
have
no
education
they
are
more
vulnerable
to
conspiracy
theories
and
radical
ideas
because
it
not
tested
against
anything
else
got
nothing
to
weigh
and
we
seen
this
across
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
and
terrorist
groups
are
all
too
happy
to
step
into
void
they
offer
salaries
to
their
foot
soldiers
so
they
can
support
their
families
sometimes
they
offer
social
services
schools
health
clinics
to
do
what
local
governments
can
not
or
will
not
do
they
try
to
justify
their
violence
in
the
name
of
fighting
the
injustice
of
corruption
that
steals
from
the
people
even
while
those
terrorist
groups
end
up
committing
even
worse
abuses
like
kidnapping
and
human
trafficking
so
if
going
to
prevent
people
from
being
susceptible
to
the
false
promises
of
extremism
then
the
international
community
has
to
offer
something
better
and
the
united
states
intends
to
do
its
part
we
will
keep
promoting
development
and
growth
that
is
broadly
shared
so
more
people
can
provide
for
their
families
keep
leading
global
effort
against
corruption
because
the
culture
of
the
bribe
has
to
be
replaced
by
good
governance
that
certain
groups
over
others
countries
have
to
truly
invest
in
the
education
and
skills
and
job
training
that
our
extraordinary
young
people
need
and
by
the
way
that
boys
and
girls
and
men
and
women
because
countries
will
not
be
truly
successful
if
half
their
populations
if
their
girls
and
their
women
are
denied
opportunity
and
america
will
continue
to
forge
new
partnerships
in
entrepreneurship
and
innovation
and
science
and
technology
so
young
people
from
morocco
to
malaysia
can
start
new
businesses
and
create
more
prosperity
just
as
we
address
economic
grievances
we
need
to
face
third
challenge
and
that
addressing
the
political
grievances
that
are
exploited
by
terrorists
when
governments
oppress
their
people
deny
human
rights
stifle
dissent
or
ethnic
and
religious
groups
or
certain
religious
groups
over
others
it
sows
the
seeds
of
extremism
and
violence
it
makes
those
communities
more
vulnerable
to
recruitment
terrorist
groups
claim
that
change
can
only
come
through
violence
and
if
peaceful
change
is
impossible
that
plays
into
extremist
propaganda
so
the
essential
ingredient
to
real
and
lasting
stability
and
progress
is
not
less
democracy
more
democracy
institutions
that
uphold
the
rule
of
law
and
apply
justice
equally
security
forces
and
police
that
respect
human
rights
and
treat
people
with
dignity
free
and
strong
civil
societies
where
people
can
and
assemble
and
advocate
for
peaceful
change
freedom
of
religion
where
all
people
can
practice
their
faith
without
fear
and
intimidation
all
of
this
is
part
of
countering
violent
extremism
fourth
we
have
to
that
our
best
partners
in
all
these
efforts
the
best
people
to
help
protect
individuals
from
falling
victim
to
extremist
ideologies
are
their
own
communities
their
own
family
members
we
have
to
be
honest
with
ourselves
terrorist
groups
like
and
deliberately
target
their
propaganda
in
the
hopes
of
reaching
and
brainwashing
young
muslims
especially
those
who
may
be
disillusioned
or
wrestling
with
their
identity
the
truth
the
videos
the
magazines
the
use
of
social
media
terrorist
twitter
accounts
all
designed
to
target
young
people
in
cyberspace
and
by
the
way
the
older
people
here
as
wise
and
respected
as
you
may
be
your
stuff
is
often
boring
compared
to
what
doing
you
not
connected
and
as
consequence
you
are
not
connecting
so
these
terrorists
are
threat
first
and
foremost
to
the
communities
that
they
target
which
means
communities
have
to
take
the
lead
in
protecting
themselves
and
that
is
true
here
in
america
as
it
true
anywhere
else
when
someone
starts
getting
family
and
friends
are
often
the
first
to
see
that
something
has
changed
in
their
personality
teachers
may
notice
student
becoming
withdrawn
or
struggling
with
his
or
her
identity
and
if
they
intervene
at
that
moment
and
offer
support
that
may
make
difference
faith
leaders
may
notice
that
someone
is
beginning
to
espouse
violent
interpretations
of
religion
and
moment
for
possible
intervention
that
allows
them
to
think
about
their
actions
and
reflect
on
the
meaning
of
their
faith
in
way
more
consistent
with
peace
and
justice
families
and
friends
coworkers
faith
leaders
they
want
to
reach
out
they
want
to
help
save
their
loved
ones
and
friends
and
prevent
them
from
taking
wrong
turn
but
communities
always
know
the
signs
to
look
for
or
have
the
tools
to
intervene
or
know
what
works
best
and
where
government
can
play
role
if
government
is
serving
as
trusted
partner
and
where
we
also
need
to
be
honest
know
some
muslim
americans
have
concerns
about
working
with
government
particularly
law
enforcement
and
their
reluctance
is
rooted
in
the
objection
to
certain
practices
where
muslim
americans
feel
been
unfairly
targeted
so
in
our
work
we
have
to
make
sure
that
abuses
stop
are
not
repeated
that
we
do
not
entire
communities
nobody
should
be
profiled
or
put
under
cloud
of
suspicion
simply
because
of
their
faith
engagement
with
communities
be
cover
for
surveillance
we
our
relationship
with
muslim
americans
dealing
with
them
solely
through
the
prism
of
law
enforcement
because
when
we
do
that
only
reinforces
suspicions
makes
it
harder
for
us
to
build
the
trust
that
we
need
to
work
together
as
part
of
this
summit
announcing
that
going
to
increase
our
outreach
to
communities
including
muslim
americans
going
to
step
up
our
efforts
to
engage
with
partners
and
raise
awareness
so
more
communities
understand
how
to
protect
their
loved
ones
from
becoming
got
to
devote
more
resources
to
these
efforts
and
as
government
does
more
communities
are
going
to
have
to
step
up
as
well
we
need
to
build
on
the
pilot
programs
that
have
been
discussed
at
this
summit
already
in
in
in
boston
these
are
partnerships
that
bring
people
together
in
spirit
of
mutual
respect
and
create
more
dialogue
and
more
trust
and
more
cooperation
if
going
to
solve
these
issues
then
the
people
who
are
most
targeted
and
potentially
most
affected
muslim
americans
have
to
have
seat
at
the
table
where
they
can
help
shape
and
strengthen
these
partnerships
so
that
all
working
together
to
help
communities
stay
safe
and
strong
and
resilient
and
finally
we
need
to
do
what
extremists
and
terrorists
hope
we
will
not
do
and
that
is
stay
true
to
the
values
that
define
us
as
free
and
diverse
societies
if
extremists
are
peddling
the
notion
that
western
countries
are
hostile
to
muslims
then
we
need
to
show
that
we
welcome
people
of
all
faiths
here
in
america
islam
has
been
woven
into
the
fabric
of
our
country
since
its
founding
generations
of
muslim
immigrants
came
here
and
went
to
work
as
farmers
and
merchants
and
factory
workers
helped
to
lay
and
build
up
america
the
first
islamic
in
new
york
city
was
founded
in
the
first
mosque
this
was
an
interesting
fact
was
in
north
muslim
americans
protect
our
communities
as
police
officers
and
firefighters
and
first
responders
and
protect
our
nation
by
serving
in
uniform
and
in
our
intelligence
communities
and
in
homeland
security
and
in
cemeteries
across
our
country
including
at
muslim
american
rest
in
peace
having
given
their
lives
in
of
all
of
us
and
of
course
the
story
extremists
and
terrorists
want
the
world
to
know
muslims
succeeding
and
thriving
in
america
because
when
that
truth
is
known
it
exposes
their
propaganda
as
the
lie
that
it
is
also
story
that
every
american
must
never
forget
because
it
reminds
us
all
that
hatred
and
bigotry
and
prejudice
have
no
place
in
our
country
not
just
counterproductive
it
just
aid
terrorists
wrong
contrary
to
who
we
are
thinking
of
little
girl
named
who
last
month
sent
me
day
card
in
the
shape
of
heart
it
was
the
first
valentine
got
got
it
from
before
and
and
gave
me
one
so
years
old
in
the
grade
young
muslim
american
and
she
said
in
her
valentine
enjoy
being
an
american
and
when
she
grows
up
she
wants
to
be
an
engineer
or
basketball
player
which
are
good
choices
but
she
wrote
am
worried
about
people
hating
some
muslims
do
bad
things
that
mean
all
of
them
do
and
she
asked
please
tell
everyone
that
we
are
good
people
and
just
like
everyone
else
now
those
are
the
words
and
the
wisdom
of
little
girl
growing
up
here
in
america
just
like
my
daughters
are
growing
up
here
in
america
just
like
everybody
else
and
everybody
needs
to
remember
that
during
the
course
of
this
debate
as
we
move
forward
with
these
challenges
we
all
have
responsibilities
we
all
have
hard
work
ahead
of
us
on
this
issue
we
paper
over
problems
and
not
going
to
solve
this
if
always
just
trying
to
be
politically
correct
but
we
do
have
to
remember
that
girl
our
hope
our
future
how
we
discredit
violent
ideologies
by
making
sure
her
voice
is
lifted
up
making
sure
nurtured
making
sure
that
supported
and
then
there
are
little
girls
and
boys
like
that
all
around
the
world
and
us
helping
to
address
economic
and
political
grievances
that
can
be
exploited
by
extremists
and
empowering
local
communities
and
us
staying
true
to
our
values
as
diverse
and
tolerant
society
even
when
threatened
especially
when
threatened
there
will
be
military
component
to
this
there
are
savage
cruelties
going
on
out
there
that
have
to
be
stopped
is
killing
muslims
at
rate
that
is
many
multiples
the
rate
that
killing
everybody
has
stake
in
stopping
them
and
there
will
be
an
element
of
us
just
stopping
them
in
their
tracks
with
force
but
to
eliminate
the
soil
out
of
which
they
grew
to
make
sure
that
we
are
giving
brighter
future
to
everyone
and
lasting
sense
of
security
then
we
going
to
have
to
make
it
clear
to
all
of
our
children
including
that
little
girl
in
grade
that
you
have
place
you
have
place
here
in
america
you
have
place
in
those
countries
where
you
live
you
have
future
ultimately
those
are
the
antidotes
to
violent
extremism
and
that
work
that
we
going
to
have
to
do
together
it
will
take
time
this
is
generational
challenge
but
after
years
it
should
be
obvious
america
has
overcome
much
bigger
challenges
and
overcome
the
ones
that
we
face
today
we
will
stay
united
and
committed
to
the
ideals
that
have
shaped
us
for
more
than
two
centuries
including
the
opportunity
and
justice
and
dignity
of
every
single
human
being
thank
you
very
much
everybody
well
this
is
going
to
be
the
first
opportunity
that
have
to
get
an
extensive
debriefing
from
secretary
carter
who
took
trip
last
week
to
and
other
parts
of
the
region
be
giving
me
some
impressions
about
how
planning
our
and
transition
in
and
talk
about
some
other
regional
issues
one
issue
that
we
will
be
discussing
is
iran
and
obviously
been
topic
of
great
interest
today
so
let
me
just
make
couple
comments
on
that
did
not
have
chance
to
watch
prime
minister
was
on
video
conference
with
our
european
partners
with
respect
to
ukraine
did
have
chance
to
take
look
at
the
transcript
and
as
far
as
can
tell
there
was
nothing
new
the
prime
minister
appropriately
pointed
out
that
the
bond
between
the
united
states
of
america
is
unbreakable
and
on
that
point
thoroughly
agree
he
also
pointed
out
that
iran
has
been
dangerous
regime
and
continues
to
engage
in
activities
that
are
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states
to
israel
and
to
the
region
and
on
that
we
agree
he
also
pointed
out
the
fact
that
iran
has
repeatedly
threatened
israel
and
engaged
in
the
most
venomous
of
statements
and
no
one
can
dispute
that
but
on
the
core
issue
which
is
how
do
we
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
which
would
make
it
far
more
dangerous
and
would
give
it
scope
for
even
greater
action
in
the
region
the
prime
minister
offer
any
viable
alternatives
so
be
clear
about
what
exactly
the
central
concern
should
be
both
for
the
united
states
and
for
israel
said
since
before
became
president
that
one
of
my
primary
goals
in
foreign
policy
would
be
preventing
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapons
and
with
the
help
of
congress
and
our
international
partners
we
constructed
an
extraordinarily
effective
sanctions
regime
that
pressured
iran
to
come
to
the
table
to
negotiate
in
serious
fashion
they
have
now
been
negotiating
over
the
last
year
and
during
that
period
iran
has
in
fact
frozen
its
program
rolled
back
some
of
its
most
dangerous
highly
enriched
uranium
and
subjected
itself
to
the
kinds
of
verifications
and
inspections
that
we
had
not
previously
seen
keep
in
mind
that
when
we
shaped
that
interim
deal
prime
minister
made
almost
the
precise
same
about
how
dangerous
that
deal
was
going
to
be
and
yet
over
year
later
even
israeli
intelligence
officers
and
in
some
cases
members
of
the
israeli
government
have
to
acknowledge
that
in
fact
it
has
kept
iran
from
further
pursuing
its
nuclear
program
now
the
deal
that
we
are
trying
to
negotiate
that
is
not
yet
completed
would
cut
off
the
different
pathways
for
iran
to
advance
its
nuclear
capabilities
it
would
roll
back
some
elements
of
its
program
it
would
ensure
that
it
did
not
have
what
we
call
breakout
capacity
that
was
shorter
than
time
and
it
would
subject
iran
to
the
most
vigorous
inspections
and
verifications
regimes
that
have
ever
been
put
in
place
and
the
alternative
that
the
prime
minister
offers
is
no
deal
in
which
case
iran
will
immediately
begin
once
again
pursuing
its
nuclear
program
accelerate
its
nuclear
program
without
us
having
any
insight
into
what
doing
and
without
constraint
and
his
essential
argument
is
that
if
we
just
double
down
on
sanctions
iran
want
to
do
that
well
we
have
evidence
from
the
past
decade
that
sanctions
alone
are
not
sufficient
to
prevent
iran
from
pursuing
its
nuclear
ambitions
and
if
it
in
fact
does
not
have
some
sense
that
sanctions
will
be
removed
it
will
not
have
an
interest
in
avoiding
the
path
that
currently
on
so
the
bottom
line
is
this
we
yet
have
deal
it
may
be
that
iran
can
not
say
yes
to
good
deal
have
repeatedly
said
that
would
rather
have
no
deal
than
bad
deal
but
if
successful
in
negotiating
then
in
fact
this
will
be
the
best
deal
possible
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
nothing
else
comes
close
sanctions
do
it
even
military
action
would
not
be
as
successful
as
the
deal
that
we
have
put
forward
and
think
it
is
very
important
not
to
be
distracted
by
the
nature
of
the
iranian
ambitions
when
it
comes
to
territory
or
terrorism
all
issues
which
we
share
concern
with
israel
about
and
are
working
consistently
with
israel
on
because
we
know
that
if
in
fact
they
obtain
nuclear
weapon
all
those
problems
would
be
worse
so
staying
focused
on
the
central
issue
here
how
do
we
prevent
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
the
path
that
proposed
if
successful
by
far
is
the
best
way
to
do
that
demonstrable
and
prime
minister
has
not
offered
any
kind
of
viable
alternative
that
would
achieve
the
same
verifiable
mechanism
to
prevent
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
so
would
urge
the
members
of
congress
who
were
there
to
continue
to
express
their
strong
support
for
security
to
continue
to
express
their
strong
interest
in
providing
the
assistance
israel
needs
to
repel
attacks
think
it
important
for
members
of
congress
on
bipartisan
basis
to
be
unified
in
pushing
back
against
terrorism
in
the
region
and
the
efforts
that
iran
may
have
engaged
in
with
our
partners
those
are
all
things
in
which
this
administration
and
israel
agree
but
when
it
comes
to
this
nuclear
deal
wait
until
actually
deal
on
the
table
that
iran
has
agreed
to
at
which
point
everybody
can
evaluate
it
we
have
to
speculate
and
what
can
guarantee
is
that
if
it
deal
signed
off
on
will
be
able
to
prove
that
it
is
the
best
way
for
us
to
prevent
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
for
us
to
pass
up
on
that
potential
opportunity
would
be
great
mistake
it
not
one
that
intend
to
make
and
will
take
that
case
to
every
member
of
congress
once
we
actually
have
deal
take
one
question
from
go
ahead
question
now
that
had
chance
to
read
the
prime
remarks
at
least
do
you
feel
like
the
he
gave
was
appropriate
considering
his
upcoming
elections
and
the
upcoming
deadline
and
you
also
talked
to
other
foreign
leaders
today
the
call
on
ukraine
did
iran
come
up
at
all
and
are
you
expecting
any
signs
of
support
from
them
your
position
versus
the
prime
minister
president
no
all
the
folks
on
the
call
today
share
my
position
that
we
should
see
if
we
can
get
this
deal
done
it
was
not
topic
of
conversation
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
the
speaker
to
offer
up
the
house
chamber
two
weeks
before
election
to
make
this
case
think
that
question
should
be
directed
to
as
said
it
is
very
important
for
us
not
to
the
relationship
between
israel
and
the
united
states
it
very
important
for
all
of
us
americans
to
that
we
have
system
of
government
in
which
foreign
policy
runs
through
the
executive
branch
and
the
president
not
through
other
channels
and
think
it
important
for
us
to
stay
focused
on
the
problem
at
hand
and
the
specific
problem
that
is
being
debated
right
now
is
not
whether
we
trust
the
iranian
regime
or
not
we
trust
them
it
not
whether
iran
engages
in
activities
everybody
agrees
with
that
the
central
question
is
how
can
we
stop
them
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
what
we
know
is
that
if
able
to
get
deal
not
only
do
we
cut
off
all
the
various
pathways
for
iran
getting
nuclear
weapon
but
we
also
know
that
have
verification
mechanism
and
an
inspection
mechanism
where
if
they
cheat
and
if
they
engage
in
covert
program
we
are
far
more
likely
to
see
it
in
time
to
do
something
about
it
what
also
know
is
if
we
have
deal
as
prime
minster
suggested
if
in
fact
right
that
not
trustworthy
they
intend
to
pursue
covert
program
and
they
cheat
be
far
less
aware
of
it
until
it
is
potentially
too
late
what
also
know
is
is
that
he
made
the
same
argument
before
this
current
interim
deal
and
even
officials
in
his
own
government
had
to
acknowledge
that
iran
has
in
fact
maintained
their
end
of
the
bargain
so
what
focused
on
right
now
is
solving
this
problem
not
focused
on
the
politics
of
it
not
focused
on
the
of
it
and
my
strong
suggestion
would
be
that
members
of
congress
as
they
evaluate
it
stay
similarly
focused
all
right
thank
you
guys
it
is
rare
in
this
life
to
follow
one
of
your
and
john
is
one
of
my
now
have
to
imagine
that
when
younger
john
woke
up
that
morning
years
ago
and
made
his
way
to
brown
chapel
heroics
were
not
on
his
mind
day
like
this
was
not
on
his
mind
young
folks
with
and
backpacks
were
milling
about
veterans
of
the
movement
trained
newcomers
in
the
tactics
of
the
right
way
to
protect
yourself
when
attacked
doctor
described
what
tear
gas
does
to
the
body
while
marchers
scribbled
down
instructions
for
contacting
their
loved
ones
the
air
was
thick
with
doubt
anticipation
and
fear
and
they
comforted
themselves
with
the
final
verse
of
the
final
hymn
they
sung
no
matter
what
may
be
the
test
god
will
take
care
of
you
lean
weary
one
upon
his
breast
god
will
take
care
of
and
then
his
knapsack
stocked
with
an
apple
toothbrush
and
book
on
government
all
you
need
for
night
behind
bars
john
led
them
out
of
the
church
on
mission
to
change
america
president
and
bush
governor
mayor
reverend
strong
members
of
congress
elected
officials
foot
soldiers
friends
fellow
americans
as
john
noted
there
are
places
and
moments
in
america
where
this
destiny
has
been
decided
many
are
sites
of
war
concord
and
others
are
sites
that
the
daring
of
character
independence
hall
and
falls
kitty
hawk
and
cape
is
such
place
in
one
afternoon
years
ago
so
much
of
our
turbulent
history
the
stain
of
slavery
and
anguish
of
civil
war
the
yoke
of
segregation
and
tyranny
of
crow
the
death
of
four
little
girls
in
and
the
dream
of
baptist
preacher
all
that
history
met
on
this
it
was
not
clash
of
armies
but
clash
of
wills
contest
to
determine
the
true
meaning
of
america
and
because
of
men
and
women
like
john
joseph
andrew
young
martin
luther
king
and
so
many
others
the
idea
of
just
america
and
fair
america
an
inclusive
america
and
generous
america
that
idea
ultimately
triumphed
as
is
true
across
the
landscape
of
american
history
we
can
not
examine
this
moment
in
isolation
the
march
on
was
part
of
broader
campaign
that
spanned
generations
the
leaders
that
day
part
of
long
line
of
we
gather
here
to
celebrate
them
we
gather
here
to
the
courage
of
ordinary
americans
willing
to
endure
billy
clubs
and
the
chastening
rod
tear
gas
and
the
trampling
hoof
men
and
women
who
despite
the
gush
of
blood
and
splintered
bone
would
stay
true
to
their
north
star
and
keep
marching
towards
justice
they
did
as
scripture
instructed
in
hope
be
patient
in
tribulation
be
constant
in
and
in
the
days
to
come
they
went
back
again
and
again
when
the
trumpet
call
sounded
for
more
to
join
the
people
came
black
and
white
young
and
old
christian
and
jew
waving
the
american
flag
and
singing
the
same
anthems
full
of
faith
and
hope
white
newsman
bill
who
covered
the
marches
then
and
who
is
with
us
here
today
quipped
that
the
growing
number
of
white
people
lowered
the
quality
of
the
singing
to
those
who
marched
though
those
old
gospel
songs
must
have
never
sounded
so
sweet
in
time
their
chorus
would
well
up
and
reach
president
and
he
would
send
them
protection
and
speak
to
the
nation
echoing
their
call
for
america
and
the
world
to
hear
shall
what
enormous
faith
these
men
and
women
had
faith
in
god
but
also
faith
in
america
the
americans
who
crossed
this
bridge
they
were
not
physically
imposing
but
they
gave
courage
to
millions
they
held
no
elected
office
but
they
led
nation
they
marched
as
americans
who
had
endured
hundreds
of
years
of
brutal
violence
countless
daily
indignities
but
they
seek
special
treatment
just
the
equal
treatment
promised
to
them
almost
century
before
what
they
did
here
will
reverberate
through
the
ages
not
because
the
change
they
won
was
preordained
not
because
their
victory
was
complete
but
because
they
proved
that
nonviolent
change
is
possible
that
love
and
hope
can
conquer
hate
as
we
commemorate
their
achievement
we
are
to
remember
that
at
the
time
of
the
marches
many
in
power
condemned
rather
than
praised
them
back
then
they
were
called
communists
or
or
outside
agitators
sexual
and
moral
degenerates
and
worse
they
were
called
everything
but
the
name
their
parents
gave
them
their
faith
was
questioned
their
lives
were
threatened
their
patriotism
challenged
and
yet
what
could
be
more
american
than
what
happened
in
this
place
what
could
more
profoundly
vindicate
the
idea
of
america
than
plain
and
humble
people
unsung
the
downtrodden
the
dreamers
not
of
high
station
not
born
to
wealth
or
privilege
not
of
one
religious
tradition
but
many
coming
together
to
shape
their
course
what
greater
expression
of
faith
in
the
american
experiment
than
this
what
greater
form
of
patriotism
is
there
than
the
belief
that
america
is
not
yet
finished
that
we
are
strong
enough
to
be
that
each
successive
generation
can
look
upon
our
imperfections
and
decide
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
remake
this
nation
to
more
closely
align
with
our
highest
ideals
why
is
not
some
outlier
in
the
american
experience
why
not
museum
or
static
monument
to
behold
from
distance
it
is
instead
the
manifestation
of
creed
written
into
our
founding
documents
the
order
to
form
more
perfect
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
these
are
not
just
words
living
thing
call
to
action
roadmap
for
citizenship
and
an
insistence
in
the
capacity
of
free
men
and
women
to
shape
our
own
destiny
for
founders
like
and
for
leaders
like
lincoln
and
the
success
of
our
experiment
in
rested
on
engaging
all
of
our
citizens
in
this
work
and
what
we
celebrate
here
in
what
this
movement
was
all
about
one
leg
in
our
long
journey
toward
freedom
the
american
instinct
that
led
these
young
men
and
women
to
pick
up
the
torch
and
cross
this
bridge
the
same
instinct
that
moved
patriots
to
choose
revolution
over
tyranny
the
same
instinct
that
drew
immigrants
from
across
oceans
and
the
the
same
instinct
that
led
women
to
reach
for
the
ballot
workers
to
against
an
unjust
status
the
same
instinct
that
led
us
to
plant
flag
at
and
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
the
idea
held
by
generations
of
citizens
who
believed
that
america
is
constant
work
in
progress
who
believed
that
loving
this
country
requires
more
than
singing
its
praises
or
avoiding
uncomfortable
truths
it
requires
the
occasional
disruption
the
willingness
to
speak
out
for
what
is
right
to
shake
up
the
status
america
what
makes
us
unique
what
cements
our
reputation
as
beacon
of
opportunity
young
people
behind
the
iron
curtain
would
see
and
eventually
tear
down
that
wall
young
people
in
soweto
would
hear
bobby
kennedy
talk
about
ripples
of
hope
and
eventually
banish
the
scourge
of
young
people
in
burma
went
to
prison
rather
than
submit
to
military
rule
they
saw
what
john
had
done
from
the
streets
of
to
the
in
ukraine
this
generation
of
young
people
can
draw
strength
from
this
place
where
the
powerless
could
change
the
greatest
power
and
push
their
leaders
to
expand
the
boundaries
of
freedom
they
saw
that
idea
made
real
right
here
in
alabama
they
saw
that
idea
manifest
itself
here
in
america
because
of
campaigns
like
this
voting
rights
act
was
passed
political
and
economic
and
social
barriers
came
down
and
the
change
these
men
and
women
wrought
is
visible
here
today
in
the
presence
of
african
americans
who
run
boardrooms
who
sit
on
the
bench
who
serve
in
elected
office
from
small
towns
to
big
cities
from
the
congressional
black
caucus
all
the
way
to
the
oval
office
because
of
what
they
did
the
doors
of
opportunity
swung
open
not
just
for
black
folks
but
for
every
american
women
marched
through
those
doors
marched
through
those
doors
asian
americans
gay
americans
americans
with
disabilities
they
all
came
through
those
doors
their
gave
the
entire
south
the
chance
to
rise
again
not
by
reasserting
the
past
but
by
transcending
the
past
what
glorious
thing
king
might
say
and
what
solemn
debt
we
owe
which
leads
us
to
ask
just
how
might
we
repay
that
debt
first
and
foremost
we
have
to
that
one
commemoration
no
matter
how
special
is
not
enough
if
taught
us
anything
that
our
work
is
never
done
the
american
experiment
in
gives
work
and
purpose
to
each
generation
teaches
us
as
well
that
action
requires
that
we
shed
our
cynicism
for
when
it
comes
to
the
pursuit
of
justice
we
can
afford
neither
complacency
nor
despair
just
this
week
was
asked
whether
thought
the
department
of
shows
that
with
respect
to
race
little
has
changed
in
this
country
and
understood
the
question
the
narrative
was
sadly
familiar
it
evoked
the
kind
of
abuse
and
disregard
for
citizens
that
spawned
the
civil
rights
movement
but
rejected
the
notion
that
changed
what
happened
in
may
not
be
unique
but
no
longer
endemic
no
longer
sanctioned
by
law
or
by
custom
and
before
the
civil
rights
movement
it
most
surely
was
we
do
disservice
to
the
cause
of
justice
by
intimating
that
bias
and
discrimination
are
immutable
that
racial
division
is
inherent
to
america
if
you
think
changed
in
the
past
years
ask
somebody
who
lived
through
the
or
chicago
or
of
the
ask
the
female
who
once
might
have
been
assigned
to
the
secretarial
pool
if
changed
ask
your
gay
friend
if
easier
to
be
out
and
proud
in
america
now
than
it
was
thirty
years
ago
to
deny
this
progress
this
progress
our
progress
would
be
to
rob
us
of
our
own
agency
our
own
capacity
our
responsibility
to
do
what
we
can
to
make
america
better
of
course
more
common
mistake
is
to
suggest
that
is
an
isolated
incident
that
racism
is
banished
that
the
work
that
drew
men
and
women
to
is
now
complete
and
that
whatever
racial
tensions
remain
are
consequence
of
those
seeking
to
play
the
for
their
own
purposes
we
need
the
report
to
know
not
true
we
just
need
to
open
our
eyes
and
our
ears
and
our
hearts
to
know
that
this
racial
history
still
casts
its
long
shadow
upon
us
we
know
the
march
is
not
yet
over
we
know
the
race
is
not
yet
won
we
know
that
reaching
that
blessed
destination
where
we
are
judged
all
of
us
by
the
content
of
our
character
requires
admitting
as
much
facing
up
to
the
truth
are
capable
of
bearing
great
burden
james
once
wrote
we
discover
that
the
burden
is
reality
and
arrive
where
reality
nothing
america
handle
if
we
actually
look
squarely
at
the
problem
and
this
is
work
for
all
americans
not
just
some
not
just
whites
not
just
blacks
if
we
want
to
the
courage
of
those
who
marched
that
day
then
all
of
us
are
called
to
possess
their
moral
imagination
all
of
us
will
need
to
feel
as
they
did
the
fierce
urgency
of
now
all
of
us
need
to
as
they
did
that
change
depends
on
our
actions
on
our
attitudes
the
things
we
teach
our
children
and
if
we
make
such
an
effort
no
matter
how
hard
it
may
sometimes
seem
laws
can
be
passed
and
consciences
can
be
stirred
and
consensus
can
be
built
with
such
an
effort
we
can
make
sure
our
criminal
justice
system
serves
all
and
not
just
some
together
we
can
raise
the
level
of
mutual
trust
that
policing
is
built
on
the
idea
that
police
officers
are
members
of
the
community
they
risk
their
lives
to
protect
and
citizens
in
and
new
york
and
they
just
want
the
same
thing
young
people
here
marched
for
years
ago
the
protection
of
the
law
together
we
can
address
unfair
sentencing
and
overcrowded
prisons
and
the
stunted
circumstances
that
rob
too
many
boys
of
the
chance
to
become
men
and
rob
the
nation
of
too
many
men
who
could
be
good
dads
and
good
workers
and
good
with
effort
we
can
roll
back
poverty
and
the
roadblocks
to
opportunity
americans
accept
free
ride
for
anybody
nor
do
we
believe
in
equality
of
outcomes
but
we
do
expect
equal
opportunity
and
if
we
really
mean
it
if
not
just
giving
lip
service
to
it
but
if
we
really
mean
it
and
are
willing
to
sacrifice
for
it
then
yes
we
can
make
sure
every
child
gets
an
education
suitable
to
this
new
century
one
that
expands
imaginations
and
lifts
sights
and
gives
those
children
the
skills
they
need
we
can
make
sure
every
person
willing
to
work
has
the
dignity
of
job
and
fair
wage
and
real
voice
and
sturdier
rungs
on
that
ladder
into
the
middle
class
and
with
effort
we
can
protect
the
foundation
stone
of
our
democracy
for
which
so
many
marched
across
this
bridge
and
that
is
the
right
to
vote
right
now
in
years
after
there
are
laws
across
this
country
designed
to
make
it
harder
for
people
to
vote
as
we
speak
more
of
such
laws
are
being
proposed
meanwhile
the
voting
rights
act
the
culmination
of
so
much
blood
so
much
sweat
and
tears
the
product
of
so
much
sacrifice
in
the
face
of
wanton
violence
the
voting
rights
act
stands
weakened
its
future
subject
to
political
how
can
that
be
the
voting
rights
act
was
one
of
the
crowning
achievements
of
our
democracy
the
result
of
republican
and
democratic
efforts
president
signed
its
renewal
when
he
was
in
office
president
george
bush
signed
its
renewal
when
he
was
in
office
one
hundred
members
of
congress
have
come
here
today
to
people
who
were
willing
to
die
for
the
right
to
protect
it
if
we
want
to
this
day
let
that
hundred
go
back
to
washington
and
gather
four
hundred
more
and
together
pledge
to
make
it
their
mission
to
restore
that
law
this
year
how
we
those
on
this
bridge
of
course
our
democracy
is
not
the
task
of
congress
alone
or
the
courts
alone
or
even
the
president
alone
if
every
new
law
was
struck
down
today
we
would
still
have
here
in
america
one
of
the
lowest
voting
rates
among
free
peoples
fifty
years
ago
registering
to
vote
here
in
and
much
of
the
south
meant
guessing
the
number
of
in
jar
the
number
of
bubbles
on
bar
of
soap
it
meant
risking
your
dignity
and
sometimes
your
life
our
excuse
today
for
not
voting
how
do
we
so
casually
discard
the
right
for
which
so
many
fought
how
do
we
so
fully
give
away
our
power
our
voice
in
shaping
future
why
are
we
pointing
to
somebody
else
when
we
could
take
the
time
just
to
go
to
the
polling
places
we
give
away
our
power
fellow
marchers
so
much
has
changed
in
years
we
have
endured
war
and
fashioned
peace
seen
technological
wonders
that
touch
every
aspect
of
our
lives
we
take
for
granted
conveniences
that
our
parents
could
have
scarcely
imagined
but
what
has
not
changed
is
the
imperative
of
citizenship
that
willingness
of
deacon
or
minister
or
young
mother
of
five
to
decide
they
loved
this
country
so
much
that
risk
everything
to
its
promise
what
it
means
to
love
america
what
it
means
to
believe
in
america
what
it
means
when
we
say
america
is
exceptional
for
we
were
born
of
change
we
broke
the
old
aristocracies
declaring
ourselves
entitled
not
by
bloodline
but
endowed
by
our
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
we
secure
our
rights
and
responsibilities
through
system
of
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
why
we
argue
and
fight
with
so
much
passion
and
conviction
because
we
know
our
efforts
matter
we
know
america
is
what
we
make
of
it
look
at
our
history
we
are
and
and
pioneers
who
braved
the
unfamiliar
followed
by
stampede
of
farmers
and
miners
and
entrepreneurs
and
our
spirit
who
we
are
we
are
sojourner
truth
and
women
who
could
do
as
much
as
any
man
and
then
some
and
who
shook
the
system
until
the
law
reflected
that
truth
that
is
our
character
the
immigrants
who
stowed
away
on
ships
to
reach
these
shores
the
huddled
masses
yearning
to
breathe
free
holocaust
survivors
soviet
defectors
the
lost
boys
of
sudan
the
hopeful
who
cross
the
because
we
want
our
kids
to
know
better
life
how
we
came
to
be
the
slaves
who
built
the
white
house
and
the
economy
of
the
south
the
ranch
hands
and
cowboys
who
opened
up
the
west
and
countless
who
laid
rail
and
raised
skyscrapers
and
for
rights
the
who
fought
to
liberate
continent
and
the
airmen
and
the
and
the
americans
who
fought
for
this
country
even
as
their
own
liberty
had
been
denied
the
firefighters
who
rushed
into
those
buildings
on
the
volunteers
who
signed
up
to
fight
in
and
iraq
the
gay
americans
whose
blood
ran
in
the
streets
of
san
and
new
york
just
as
blood
ran
down
this
bridge
we
are
storytellers
writers
poets
artists
who
abhor
unfairness
and
despise
hypocrisy
and
give
voice
to
the
voiceless
and
tell
truths
that
need
to
be
told
the
inventors
of
gospel
and
jazz
and
blues
and
country
and
and
rock
and
roll
and
our
very
own
sound
with
all
the
sweet
sorrow
and
reckless
joy
of
freedom
we
are
enduring
scorn
and
spiked
and
pitches
coming
straight
to
his
head
and
stealing
home
in
the
world
series
anyway
we
are
the
people
wrote
of
who
our
temples
for
tomorrow
strong
as
we
know
we
are
the
people
wrote
of
for
truth
and
sake
stand
fast
and
suffer
long
who
are
tired
so
long
as
we
can
see
far
what
america
is
not
stock
photos
or
history
or
feeble
attempts
to
define
some
of
us
as
more
american
than
others
we
respect
the
past
but
we
pine
for
the
past
we
fear
the
future
we
grab
for
it
america
is
not
some
fragile
thing
we
are
large
in
the
words
of
containing
multitudes
we
are
boisterous
and
diverse
and
full
of
energy
perpetually
young
in
spirit
why
someone
like
john
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
could
lead
mighty
march
and
what
the
young
people
here
today
and
listening
all
across
the
country
must
take
away
from
this
day
you
are
america
unconstrained
by
habit
and
convention
unencumbered
by
what
is
because
ready
to
seize
what
ought
to
be
for
everywhere
in
this
country
there
are
first
steps
to
be
taken
new
ground
to
cover
there
are
more
bridges
to
be
crossed
and
it
is
you
the
young
and
fearless
at
heart
the
most
diverse
and
educated
generation
in
our
history
who
the
nation
is
waiting
to
follow
because
shows
us
that
america
is
not
the
project
of
any
one
person
because
the
powerful
word
in
our
democracy
is
the
word
the
shall
we
that
word
is
owned
by
no
one
it
belongs
to
everyone
oh
what
glorious
task
we
are
given
to
continually
try
to
improve
this
great
nation
of
ours
fifty
years
from
bloody
sunday
our
march
is
not
yet
finished
but
getting
closer
two
hundred
and
years
after
this
founding
our
union
is
not
yet
perfect
but
we
are
getting
closer
our
easier
because
somebody
already
got
us
through
that
first
mile
somebody
already
got
us
over
that
bridge
when
it
feels
the
road
is
too
hard
when
the
torch
been
passed
feels
too
heavy
we
will
remember
these
early
and
draw
strength
from
their
example
and
hold
firmly
the
words
of
the
prophet
those
who
hope
in
the
lord
will
renew
their
strength
they
will
soar
on
wings
like
eagles
they
will
run
and
not
grow
weary
they
will
walk
and
not
be
we
those
who
walked
so
we
could
run
we
must
run
so
our
children
soar
and
we
will
not
grow
weary
for
we
believe
in
the
power
of
an
awesome
god
and
we
believe
in
this
sacred
promise
may
he
bless
those
warriors
of
justice
no
longer
with
us
and
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
everybody
give
it
up
for
buzz
and
the
georgia
tech
band
for
getting
us
fired
up
also
give
it
up
for
governor

great
institution

also
have
special
guest
with
us

is
proud
georgia
tech
alum
who
just
happens
also
to
be
the
vice
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
admiral
sandy

here
sandy

vice
chairman

the
joint
chiefs
of
staff

navy
fighter
pilot
which
is
cooler

to
meetings
up
with
that
told
him
got
to
get
back
on
plane
it
is
great
to
be
at
one
of
the
finest
technical
institutes
in
the
world
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
mean
got
to
be
if
the
wreck
is
still
running
after
all
these
years
georgia
tech
reference
that
some
of
you
may
not
know
also
know
that
georgia
tech
is
terrific
because
actually
worked
with
you
on
several
fronts
from
promoting
advanced
manufacturing
to
unlocking
the
mysteries
of
the
brain
to
helping
more
students
become
entrepreneurs
and
the
reason
wanted
to
come
here
today
is
because
believe
that
higher
education
as
you
believe
is
one
of
the
best
investments
that
anybody
can
make
in
their
future
and
also
one
of
the
best
investments
you
can
make
in
our
future
so
here
to
say
thank
you
and
to
tell
you
proud
of
you
because
know
that
not
always
easy
to
do
what
doing
it
takes
perseverance
lot
of
late
nights
in
the
library
and
the
lab
and
wrapping
your
minds
around
complex
formulas
and
concepts
that
frankly
understand
but
know
complex
and
some
of
you
are
holding
jobs
down
at
the
same
time
which
makes
it
even
harder
but
as
frustrating
as
it
may
be
and
expressed
some
frustrations
on
occasion
it
is
worth
it
higher
education
has
never
been
more
important
and
the
message
want
to
deliver
today
not
just
to
you
but
to
the
entire
country
is
the
entire
nation
has
to
treat
it
as
priority
right
now
our
economy
is
growing
steadily
it
creating
new
jobs
going
to
be
going
into
job
market
much
better
than
the
one
that
existed
when
came
into
office
six
years
ago
after
the
worst
economic
crisis
of
our
lifetimes
over
the
past
five
years
our
businesses
have
now
created
million
new
jobs
unemployment
continues
to
come
down
and
obviously
good
news
for
those
of
you
who
are
graduating
soon
yes
right
you
want
job
your
parents
also
want
you
to
have
job
they
want
you
on
the
couch
but
run
for
president
just
to
get
us
back
to
where
we
were
ran
for
president
to
get
us
to
where
we
need
to
go
and
where
we
need
to
go
is
growing
middle
class
with
rising
incomes
and
opportunities
for
everybody
willing
to
work
hard
an
america
where
no
matter
who
you
are
what
you
look
like
where
you
came
from
how
you
started
who
you
love
what
faith
part
of
you
can
make
it
in
this
country
if
you
try
what
america
is
all
about
and
today
college
degree
is
the
surest
ticket
to
the
middle
class
and
beyond
the
key
to
getting
good
job
that
pays
good
income
and
it
offers
measure
of
security
because
college
degree
tells
employers
that
you
just
have
one
set
of
skills
that
got
the
continuous
capacity
to
learn
new
skills
which
is
going
to
be
particularly
important
for
your
generation
because
the
economy
is
going
to
churn
and
change
in
ways
that
none
of
us
can
even
anticipate
before
we
came
out
here
was
talking
to
group
including
sandy
and
your
mayor
reed
perry
buddies
he
in
he
was
and
we
were
talking
about
how
rapidly
the
technology
is
transforming
everything
we
understand
everything
we
know
everything
from
drones
to
artificial
intelligence
to
cars
and
we
yet
know
how
all
that
is
going
to
shape
the
nation
that
you
inherit
but
we
know
it
going
to
shape
it
dramatically
and
in
order
for
you
to
be
able
to
be
successful
going
to
have
to
adapt
continuously
the
days
where
you
work
at
one
place
for
years
those
days
are
over
and
so
the
you
are
getting
now
are
going
to
keep
you
in
that
job
market
going
to
have
multiple
jobs
before
some
of
you
will
have
multiple
careers
and
we
live
in
economy
where
your
most
valuable
asset
is
your
imagination
your
knowledge
your
ability
to
tough
problems
and
not
just
true
for
individual
americans
true
for
our
whole
country
the
ability
to
compete
in
the
global
economy
depends
on
us
having
the
most
skilled
workforce
and
by
the
way
let
me
just
add
also
going
to
be
critical
for
us
to
maintain
our
democracy
in
complex
diverse
society
understandably
when
come
to
college
campuses
lot
of
just
bread
and
butter
nuts
and
bolts
how
does
this
translate
into
jobs
careers
but
part
of
what
has
made
america
the
exceptional
nation
that
it
is
is
our
diversity
and
our
ability
to
draw
from
every
corner
of
the
world
all
the
talent
all
the
ideas
and
create
this
amazing
stew
and
the
more
complex
this
society
the
tougher
that
becomes
and
so
to
have
all
of
you
possess
the
ability
to
listen
and
to
learn
from
people
who
like
you
also
what
learning
here
and
going
to
make
you
more
effective
to
every
employer
out
there
but
also
going
to
make
you
better
citizens
and
going
to
make
our
democracy
function
better
but
back
to
the
jobs
thing
jobs
and
businesses
will
go
wherever
the
best
workers
are
and
want
them
to
have
to
look
any
further
than
the
united
states
of
america
want
businesses
investing
here
want
americans
getting
those
new
jobs
how
going
to
lead
the
world
in
this
century
just
like
we
did
in
the
century
so
the
challenge
higher
education
has
never
been
more
important
but
also
never
been
more
expensive
the
average
who
borrows
money
to
pay
for
college
graduates
with
about
in
student
loan
debt
just
the
average
some
students
end
up
with
lot
more
than
that
you
know
who
you
are
not
telling
you
anything
you
know
and
let
me
say
that
been
established
time
and
time
again
that
georgia
tech
is
one
of
the
best
bargains
around
you
are
getting
great
education
for
great
value
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
here
obviously
go
to
place
that
was
bad
bargain
and
really
expensive
and
no
value
that
would
not
make
sense
but
even
here
at
georgia
tech
even
with
the
great
value
it
is
expensive
and
here
to
tell
you
with
you
believe
that
america
is
not
place
where
higher
education
is
privilege
that
is
reserved
for
the
few
america
needs
to
be
place
where
higher
education
has
to
be
available
for
every
single
person
willing
to
strive
for
it
willing
to
work
for
it
and
said
this
before
take
this
personally
my
grandfather
had
chance
to
go
to
college
because
this
country
decided
that
when
veterans
returned
home
from
world
war
they
should
be
able
to
go
to
college
and
this
government
stepped
up
my
mother
was
able
to
raise
two
kids
by
herself
in
part
because
she
got
grants
that
helped
pay
for
her
education
and
am
only
standing
here
and
is
only
where
she
is
today
because
of
scholarships
and
student
loans
and
work
study
we
did
not
come
from
families
of
means
we
did
come
from
families
of
means
but
we
knew
that
if
we
worked
hard
there
was
help
out
there
to
make
sure
we
got
great
education
what
this
country
gave
to
us
and
why
this
has
been
such
priority
for
me
take
it
personally
because
when
look
out
at
all
of
you
see
myself
and
remember
the
fact
that
it
took
me
years
to
pay
off
all
our
student
loans
we
were
paying
more
for
our
student
loans
than
our
mortgage
even
after
and
were
born
we
were
supposed
to
be
saving
for
their
college
education
we
were
still
paying
off
ours
and
that
why
acted
again
and
again
to
make
college
more
affordable
five
years
ago
this
month
we
enacted
the
largest
reforms
to
the
student
loan
program
in
history
we
cut
out
the
big
banks
that
were
taking
taxpayer
dollars
and
serving
as
middlemen
in
the
student
loan
game
and
we
said
well
just
give
the
money
directly
to
the
students
like
you
so
as
result
of
that
change
we
saved
billions
of
dollars
we
were
to
expand
tax
credits
and
grants
and
put
college
within
reach
for
millions
more
and
students
across
the
country
then
we
fought
to
keep
interest
rates
on
student
rates
interest
rates
on
student
loans
low
and
capped
how
high
those
rates
can
rise
and
as
result
the
typical
is
saving
about
we
also
acted
to
let
millions
of
graduates
cap
their
loan
payments
at
percent
of
their
incomes
so
they
have
to
choose
between
paying
the
rent
and
paying
back
their
debt
and
by
the
way
everybody
here
if
you
do
already
know
about
the
repayment
program
you
need
to
learn
about
it
because
still
but
it
gives
you
an
opportunity
to
make
sure
that
if
you
make
career
choice
that
does
make
tons
of
money
you
still
able
to
do
the
responsible
thing
and
pay
back
your
loans
at
pace
that
also
allows
you
to
build
family
and
buy
home
and
live
your
lives
and
graduates
who
go
into
fields
like
social
work
or
teaching
they
not
going
to
pay
price
for
following
their
dreams
because
they
going
to
have
even
better
options
in
terms
of
how
they
repay
their
loans
so
that
what
we
did
on
the
student
loan
side
meanwhile
working
to
hold
down
the
cost
of
college
education
so
partnering
with
schools
like
georgia
tech
on
innovative
ways
to
increase
value
like
your
program
in
computer
science
which
costs
just
fraction
of
the
price
of
an
program
and
sent
congress
bold
new
plan
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
community
college
to
zero
because
not
everybody
may
be
prepared
right
away
to
start
university
but
also
in
some
cases
even
if
they
could
they
may
choose
to
get
two
years
of
college
free
and
then
be
able
to
transfer
the
credits
for
their
education
we
want
to
make
community
college
at
minimum
just
as
free
and
universal
as
high
school
is
today
that
should
be
our
new
baseline
we
want
to
get
out
ahead
of
the
curve
in
terms
of
where
we
need
to
go
earlier
today
took
new
action
to
make
it
easier
for
students
to
pay
for
college
and
pay
off
their
loans
creating
way
for
you
to
ask
questions
about
your
loans
file
complaint
cut
through
the
bureaucracy
get
faster
response
not
just
from
the
government
also
from
the
contractors
who
sometimes
service
your
loans
going
to
require
that
the
businesses
that
service
your
loans
provide
clear
information
about
how
much
you
owe
what
your
options
are
for
repaying
it
and
if
falling
behind
help
you
get
back
in
good
standing
with
reasonable
fees
on
reasonable
and
if
paying
stuff
off
you
should
be
paying
off
the
loans
first
not
the
ones
going
to
take
hard
look
at
whether
we
need
new
laws
to
strengthen
protections
for
all
borrowers
wherever
you
get
your
loans
from
so
trying
to
tackle
this
problem
from
every
angle
no
silver
bullet
but
trying
to
make
sure
that
across
the
board
more
and
more
young
people
can
afford
to
go
to
college
and
then
afterwards
so
burdened
with
debt
that
you
do
anything
else
we
want
to
make
this
experience
more
affordable
because
not
just
investing
in
yourselves
investing
in
your
nation
but
the
thing
got
more
to
do
all
of
us
universities
students
parents
financial
institutions
and
yes
the
government
to
make
sure
that
not
saddled
with
debt
before
you
even
get
started
in
life
something
in
all
of
our
interests
now
my
friends
the
republicans
in
congress
are
planning
to
unveil
their
budget
soon
hoping
they
have
something
to
offer
that
will
help
hardworking
young
people
so
far
the
education
bill
that
they
put
forward
couple
weeks
ago
is
not
good
template
not
good
start
hoping
it
will
improve
because
right
now
the
way
structured
it
would
let
states
and
cities
shuffle
education
dollars
into
things
like
sports
stadiums
or
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
instead
of
schools
and
it
would
allow
states
to
make
even
deeper
cuts
into
school
districts
that
need
the
most
support
send
even
more
money
to
the
most
school
districts
invest
less
per
child
by
the
end
of
the
decade
than
we
do
now
so
the
wrong
approach
got
to
be
working
to
make
sure
every
child
gets
quality
education
every
student
can
afford
college
and
so
going
to
be
reaching
out
to
them
trying
to
get
them
to
see
this
is
good
investment
in
our
economy
good
investment
in
our
national
security
the
way
that
you
keep
america
safe
one
of
the
best
most
important
ways
is
to
make
sure
got
strong
economy
with
strong
workforce
and
all
of
us
have
role
to
play
in
making
that
happen
so
in
order
to
spur
more
of
conversation
to
get
more
folks
engaged
going
to
try
something
new
to
help
do
this
not
fancy
new
program
not
it
have
complicated
acronym
it
involve
new
spending
or
bureaucracy
just
simple
principle
that
want
all
of
us
to
sign
onto
declaration
of
values
what
calling
student
aid
bill
of
rights
and
it
says
every
student
deserves
access
to
quality
affordable
education
every
student
should
be
able
to
access
the
resources
to
pay
for
college
every
borrower
has
the
right
to
an
affordable
repayment
plan
every
borrower
has
the
right
to
quality
customer
service
reliable
information
and
fair
treatment
even
if
they
struggle
to
repay
their
loans
simple
set
of
principles
that
if
everybody
signed
onto
republicans
democrats
state
legislators
university
presidents
members
of
congress
it
can
focus
our
attention
all
these
different
things
that
doing
into
one
simple
basic
idea
which
is
make
sure
that
when
doing
the
right
thing
that
your
society
has
got
your
back
and
is
looking
out
for
you
so
based
on
this
principle
going
to
make
sure
universities
are
using
technology
to
help
students
learn
at
lower
costs
going
to
make
sure
that
loan
can
find
better
ways
to
help
borrowers
keep
up
with
monthly
payments
that
they
can
afford
we
as
country
can
do
more
to
invest
in
grants
and
community
college
to
make
sure
quality
education
is
affordable
for
everybody
so
going
to
just
keep
on
moving
on
every
front
and
we
want
everybody
who
agrees
with
these
principles
to
sit
down
and
work
with
us
and
figure
out
how
they
can
make
these
student
rights
real
and
got
part
to
play
as
well
we
had
the
great
of
being
at
this
past
weekend
for
the
anniversary
of
the
march
from
and
one
of
the
main
points
think
that
all
of
us
made
was
change
happen
by
itself
it
happens
because
people
get
and
and
focused
and
they
push
and
sometimes
they
disrupt
and
they
make
folks
uncomfortable
and
they
ask
questions
about
why
is
it
this
way
instead
of
that
way
and
want
us
to
think
about
access
to
higher
education
and
affordability
of
higher
education
in
that
same
way
want
us
to
all
together
not
on
partisan
basis
not
around
an
election
around
simple
idea
that
everybody
should
be
able
to
get
behind
and
going
to
have
to
play
the
part
because
what
we
also
made
the
point
of
this
past
weekend
is
young
people
typically
lead
the
pack
with
new
ideas
with
new
initiatives
with
new
focus
with
new
vision
so
if
you
agree
with
the
basic
values
that
outlined
if
you
believe
in
student
aid
bill
of
rights
that
will
help
more
americans
pay
for
quality
education
then
sign
your
name
to
this
declaration
you
can
go
to
website
because
you
guys
like
tech
stuff
you
go
to
tell
your
families
and
classmates
and
professors
to
do
it
going
to
ask
members
of
congress
and
lenders
and
as
many
business
leaders
as
can
find
to
sign
up
going
to
coalition
around
this
country
to
get
this
process
moving
because
there
are
lot
of
good
ideas
right
now
but
stalled
or
happening
piecemeal
or
happening
in
one
university
or
happening
in
one
state
and
they
have
to
happen
everywhere
and
got
to
the
entire
nation
to
make
that
happen
and
it
going
to
start
with
students
themselves
because
if
you
asking
for
something
different
if
you
asking
for
help
if
not
getting
then
folks
going
to
help
you
and
then
just
be
complaining
especially
once
you
graduate
and
you
start
having
to
write
those
checks
so
stop
engaging
in
this
issue
even
after
you
graduate
because
be
still
impacted
by
it
and
in
the
meantime
got
to
study
hard
and
work
hard
and
have
fun
make
some
new
discoveries
inspire
us
lead
us
be
the
americans
that
we
need
you
to
be
every
american
should
have
the
right
to
go
as
far
as
their
talents
and
hard
work
will
take
them
that
is
what
college
is
all
about
that
is
what
america
is
all
about
and
you
embody
that
basic
notion
you
are
that
talent
you
are
an
embodiment
of
what
we
hope
for
country
that
says
that
everybody
rich
poor
black
white
hispanic
asian
gay
straight
man
woman
with
disabilities
without
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
not
only
can
you
succeed
but
you
can
help
everybody
else
succeed
the
promise
that
helped
us
become
the
greatest
nation
in
the
world
the
promise
that
need
you
working
for
thank
you
everybody
god
bless
you
thank
you
georgia
to
ted
ambassador
smith
members
of
the
kennedy
family
thank
you
so
much
for
inviting
me
to
speak
today
your
eminence
cardinal
vice
president
governor
baker
mayor
members
of
congress
past
and
present
and
pretty
much
every
elected
official
in
it
is
an
to
mark
this
occasion
with
you
boston
know
that
and
have
joined
our
prayers
with
yours
these
past
few
days
for
hero
former
army
ranger
and
boston
police
officer
john
who
was
shot
in
the
line
of
duty
on
friday
night
mention
him
because
last
year
at
the
white
house
the
vice
president
and
had
the
chance
to
officer
as
one
of
for
his
bravery
in
the
line
of
duty
for
risking
his
life
to
save
fellow
officer
and
thanks
to
the
at
boston
medical
told
officer
is
awake
and
talking
and
we
wish
him
full
and
speedy
recovery
also
want
to
single
out
someone
who
very
much
wanted
to
be
here
just
as
he
was
every
day
for
nearly
years
as
he
represented
this
commonwealth
alongside
ted
in
the
senate
and
that
secretary
of
state
john
as
many
of
you
know
john
is
in
europe
with
our
allies
and
partners
leading
the
negotiations
with
iran
and
the
world
community
and
standing
up
for
principle
that
ted
and
his
brother
president
kennedy
believed
in
so
strongly
us
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
but
let
us
never
fear
to
and
finally
in
his
first
years
in
the
senate
ted
dispatched
young
aide
to
assemble
team
of
talent
without
rival
the
sell
was
simple
come
and
help
ted
kennedy
make
history
so
want
to
give
special
to
his
extraordinarily
loyal
staff
years
later
family
more
than
one
thousand
strong
this
is
your
day
as
well
we
proud
of
you
of
course
many
of
you
now
work
with
me
so
enjoy
today
because
we
got
to
get
back
to
work
distinguished
guests
fellow
citizens
in
ted
kennedy
was
young
man
working
to
his
brother
jack
to
the
united
states
senate
on
election
night
the
two
toasted
one
another
to
president
ted
said
you
can
make
with
his
quick
irish
wit
jack
returned
the
toast
to
senator
kennedy
if
you
can
make
they
both
made
it
and
today
together
again
in
eternal
rest
at
but
their
legacies
are
as
alive
as
ever
together
right
here
in
boston
the
john
kennedy
library
next
door
is
symbol
of
our
american
idealism
the
kennedy
institute
for
the
united
states
senate
as
living
example
of
the
hard
frustrating
but
critical
work
required
to
make
that
idealism
real
what
more
fitting
tribute
what
better
testament
to
the
life
of
ted
kennedy
than
this
place
that
he
left
for
new
generation
of
americans
monument
not
to
himself
but
to
what
we
the
people
have
the
power
to
do
together
any
of
us
who
have
had
the
privilege
to
serve
in
the
senate
know
that
impossible
not
to
share
awe
for
the
history
swirling
around
you
an
awe
instilled
in
him
by
his
brother
jack
ted
waited
more
than
year
to
deliver
his
first
on
the
senate
floor
that
no
longer
the
custom
it
good
to
see
and
here
because
they
remember
what
customs
were
like
back
then
and
ted
gave
only
because
he
felt
there
was
topic
the
civil
rights
act
that
demanded
it
nevertheless
he
spoke
with
humility
aware
as
he
put
it
that
freshman
senator
should
be
seen
not
heard
should
learn
and
not
some
of
us
admit
have
not
always
heeded
that
lesson
but
fortunately
we
had
ted
to
show
us
the
ropes
anyway
and
no
one
made
the
senate
come
alive
like
ted
kennedy
it
was
one
of
the
great
pleasures
of
my
life
to
hear
ted
kennedy
deliver
one
of
his
stem
winders
on
the
floor
rarely
was
he
more
animated
than
when
lead
you
through
the
living
museums
that
were
his
offices
he
could
and
he
would
tell
you
everything
that
there
was
to
know
about
all
of
it
and
then
there
were
more
moments
still
remember
the
first
time
pulled
open
the
drawer
of
my
desk
each
senator
is
assigned
desk
and
tradition
of
carving
the
names
of
those
who
had
used
it
before
and
those
names
in
my
desk
included
and
baker
and
kennedy
the
senate
was
place
where
you
instinctively
pulled
yourself
up
little
bit
straighter
where
you
tried
to
act
little
bit
better
senator
changes
person
ted
wrote
in
his
memoirs
as
said
it
may
take
year
or
two
years
or
three
years
but
it
always
happens
it
fills
you
with
heightened
sense
of
purpose
the
magic
of
the
senate
the
essence
of
what
it
can
be
and
who
but
ted
kennedy
and
his
family
would
create
replica
of
the
senate
chamber
and
open
it
to
everyone
we
live
in
time
of
such
great
cynicism
about
all
our
institutions
and
we
are
cynical
about
government
and
about
washington
most
of
all
hard
for
our
children
to
see
in
the
noisy
and
too
often
trivial
pursuits
of
politics
the
possibilities
of
our
democracy
our
capacity
together
to
do
big
things
and
this
place
can
help
change
that
it
can
help
light
the
fire
of
imagination
plant
the
seed
of
noble
ambition
in
the
minds
of
future
generations
imagine
gaggle
of
school
kids
clutching
tablets
turning
classrooms
into
cloakrooms
and
hallways
into
hearing
rooms
assigned
an
issue
of
the
day
and
the
responsibility
to
solve
it
imagine
their
moral
universe
expanding
as
they
hear
about
the
momentous
battles
waged
in
that
chamber
and
how
they
echo
throughout
society
great
questions
of
war
and
peace
the
tangled
bargains
between
north
and
south
federal
and
state
the
original
sins
of
slavery
and
prejudice
and
the
unfinished
battles
for
civil
rights
and
opportunity
and
equality
imagine
the
shift
in
their
sense
of
possible
the
first
time
they
see
video
of
senators
who
look
like
they
do
men
and
women
blacks
and
whites
those
born
to
great
wealth
but
also
those
born
of
incredibly
modest
means
imagine
what
child
feels
the
first
time
she
steps
onto
that
floor
before
old
enough
to
be
cynical
before
told
what
she
do
before
told
who
she
talk
to
or
work
with
what
she
feels
when
she
sits
at
one
of
those
desks
what
happens
when
it
comes
her
turn
to
stand
and
speak
on
behalf
of
something
she
cares
about
and
cast
vote
and
have
sense
of
purpose
maybe
just
not
for
kids
what
if
we
all
carried
ourselves
that
way
what
if
our
politics
our
democracy
were
as
elevated
as
purposeful
as
she
imagines
it
to
be
right
here
towards
the
end
of
his
life
ted
reflected
on
how
congress
has
changed
over
time
and
those
who
served
earlier
think
have
those
same
conversations
more
diverse
more
accurate
reflection
of
america
than
it
used
to
be
and
that
is
grand
thing
great
achievement
but
ted
grieved
the
loss
of
camaraderie
and
the
interaction
think
he
regretted
the
arguments
now
made
to
cameras
instead
of
colleagues
directed
at
narrow
base
instead
of
the
body
politic
as
whole
the
influence
of
money
and
special
interests
and
how
it
all
leads
more
americans
to
turn
away
in
disgust
and
simply
choose
not
to
exercise
their
right
to
vote
now
since
this
is
joyous
occasion
this
is
not
the
time
for
me
to
suggest
slew
of
new
ideas
for
reform
although
do
have
some
maybe
just
mention
one
what
if
we
carried
ourselves
more
like
ted
kennedy
what
if
we
worked
to
follow
his
example
little
bit
harder
to
his
harshest
critics
who
saw
him
as
nothing
more
than
partisan
lightning
rod
that
may
sound
foolish
but
there
are
republicans
here
today
for
reason
they
know
who
ted
kennedy
was
not
because
they
shared
ideology
or
his
positions
but
because
they
knew
ted
as
somebody
who
bridged
the
partisan
divide
over
and
over
and
over
again
with
genuine
effort
and
affection
in
an
era
when
has
become
so
very
rare
they
knew
him
as
somebody
who
kept
his
word
they
knew
him
as
somebody
who
was
willing
to
take
half
loaf
and
endure
the
anger
of
his
own
supporters
to
get
something
done
they
knew
him
as
somebody
who
was
not
afraid
and
fear
so
permeates
our
politics
instead
of
hope
people
fight
to
get
in
the
senate
and
then
afraid
we
fight
to
get
these
positions
and
then
want
to
do
anything
with
them
and
ted
understood
the
only
point
of
running
for
office
was
to
get
something
done
not
to
posture
not
to
sit
there
worrying
about
the
next
election
or
the
polls
to
take
risks
he
understood
that
differences
of
party
or
philosophy
could
not
become
barriers
to
cooperation
or
respect
he
could
howl
at
injustice
on
the
senate
floor
like
force
of
nature
while
nervous
aides
tried
to
figure
out
which
chart
to
pull
up
next
but
in
his
personal
dealings
he
answered
call
to
keep
the
senate
place
to
if
possible
the
fury
of
did
not
know
ted
as
long
as
some
of
the
speakers
here
today
but
he
was
my
friend
owe
him
lot
and
as
far
as
could
tell
it
was
never
ideology
that
compelled
him
except
insofar
as
his
ideology
said
you
should
help
people
that
you
should
have
life
of
purpose
that
you
should
be
empathetic
and
be
able
to
put
yourself
in
somebody
shoes
and
see
through
their
eyes
his
his
restlessness
they
were
rooted
in
his
experience
by
the
age
of
he
was
member
of
gold
star
family
by
two
of
his
brothers
were
stolen
from
him
in
the
most
tragic
public
of
ways
by
he
nearly
lost
beloved
child
to
cancer
and
that
made
suffering
something
he
knew
and
it
made
him
more
alive
to
the
suffering
of
others
while
his
son
was
sleeping
after
treatment
ted
would
wander
the
halls
of
the
hospital
and
meet
other
parents
keeping
vigil
over
their
own
children
they
were
parents
terrified
of
what
would
happen
when
they
afford
the
next
treatment
parents
working
out
what
they
could
sell
or
borrow
or
mortgage
just
to
make
it
just
few
more
months
and
then
if
they
had
to
bargain
with
god
for
the
rest
there
in
the
quiet
night
working
people
of
modest
means
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
the
world
shared
the
same
intimate
immediate
sense
of
helplessness
he
did
see
them
as
some
abstraction
he
knew
them
he
felt
them
their
pain
was
his
as
much
as
they
might
be
separated
by
wealth
and
fame
and
those
families
would
be
at
the
heart
of
passions
just
like
the
young
immigrant
he
would
see
himself
in
that
child
they
were
his
cause
the
sick
child
who
see
doctor
the
young
soldier
sent
to
battle
without
the
citizen
denied
her
rights
because
of
what
she
looked
like
or
where
she
came
from
or
who
she
loves
he
quietly
attended
as
many
military
funerals
in
as
he
could
for
those
who
fell
in
iraq
and
he
called
and
wrote
each
one
of
the
families
in
this
commonwealth
who
lost
loved
one
on
and
he
took
them
sailing
and
played
with
their
children
not
just
in
the
days
after
but
every
year
after
his
work
was
not
to
champion
those
with
wealth
or
power
or
connections
they
already
had
enough
representation
it
was
to
give
voice
to
the
people
who
wrote
and
called
him
from
every
state
desperate
for
somebody
who
might
listen
and
help
it
was
about
what
he
could
do
for
others
why
take
his
hearings
to
hospitals
in
rural
towns
and
inner
cities
and
push
people
out
of
their
comfort
zones
including
his
colleagues
because
he
had
pushed
himself
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
he
tried
to
in
his
colleagues
that
same
sense
of
empathy
even
if
they
called
him
as
one
did
at
the
top
of
his
even
if
they
might
disagree
with
him
percent
of
the
time
because
who
knew
what
might
happen
with
that
other
percent
hatch
was
sent
to
washington
in
part
because
he
promised
to
fight
ted
kennedy
and
they
fought
lot
one
was
conservative
mormon
from
utah
after
all
the
other
one
was
well
ted
kennedy
but
once
they
got
to
know
one
another
they
discovered
certain
things
in
common
devout
faith
soft
spot
for
health
care
very
fine
singing
voices
in
when
republicans
controlled
the
senate
held
the
first
hearing
on
the
aids
epidemic
even
hugging
an
aids
patient
an
incredible
and
very
important
gesture
at
the
time
the
next
year
ted
took
over
the
committee
and
continued
what
started
when
father
passed
away
ted
was
one
of
the
first
to
call
it
was
over
dinner
at
house
one
night
that
they
decided
to
try
and
insure
the
million
children
who
have
access
to
health
care
as
that
debate
hit
roadblocks
in
congress
as
apparently
debates
over
health
care
tend
to
do
ted
would
have
his
chief
of
staff
serenade
to
court
his
support
when
hearings
go
way
he
might
puff
on
cigar
to
annoy
who
disdained
smoking
when
they
go
way
he
might
threaten
to
call
sister
and
when
it
came
time
to
find
way
to
pay
for
the
health
insurance
program
that
they
together
had
devised
ted
pounced
offering
tobacco
tax
and
asking
you
for
camel
and
the
man
or
millions
of
children
who
lack
adequate
health
care
it
was
the
kind
of
friendship
unique
to
the
senate
calling
to
mind
what
john
once
said
of
henry
clay
like
clay
he
is
bad
man
an
imposter
creator
of
wicked
schemes
speak
to
him
but
by
god
love
him
so
sure
hatch
once
called
ted
of
the
major
dangers
to
the
but
he
also
stood
up
at
gathering
in
last
months
and
said
asking
you
all
to
pray
for
ted
the
point
is
we
can
fight
on
almost
everything
but
we
can
come
together
on
some
things
and
those
can
mean
everything
to
whole
lot
of
people
it
was
common
ground
that
led
ted
and
to
forge
compromise
that
covered
millions
of
kids
with
health
care
it
was
common
ground
rooted
in
the
plight
of
loved
ones
that
led
ted
and
chuck
to
cover
kids
with
disabilities
that
led
ted
and
to
fight
for
equal
rights
for
americans
with
mental
illness
common
ground
not
rooted
in
abstractions
or
stubborn
rigid
ideologies
but
shared
experience
that
led
ted
and
john
to
work
on
bill
of
rights
and
to
work
to
forge
smarter
more
just
immigration
system
common
desire
to
fix
broken
willingness
to
compromise
in
pursuit
of
larger
goal
personal
relationship
that
lets
you
fight
like
heck
on
one
issue
and
shake
hands
on
the
next
not
through
just
cajoling
or
or
serenades
but
through
brand
of
friendship
and
kindness
and
and
grace
binds
us
together
across
our
differences
in
religion
or
politics
or
economic
theory
ted
wrote
in
his
memoirs
is
all
we
share
as
human
beings
the
wonder
that
we
experience
when
we
look
at
the
night
sky
the
gratitude
that
we
know
when
we
feel
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
sense
of
in
the
face
of
the
unbearable
and
the
persistence
of
suffering
and
one
thing
more
the
capacity
to
reach
across
our
differences
to
offer
hand
of
for
all
the
challenges
of
changing
world
for
all
the
imperfections
of
our
democracy
the
capacity
to
reach
across
our
differences
is
something
entirely
up
to
us
may
we
all
in
our
own
lives
set
an
example
for
the
kids
who
enter
these
doors
and
exit
with
higher
expectations
for
their
country
may
we
all
remember
the
times
this
american
family
has
challenged
us
to
ask
what
we
can
do
to
dream
and
say
why
not
to
seek
cause
that
endures
and
sail
against
the
wind
in
its
pursuit
and
live
our
lives
with
that
heightened
sense
of
purpose
thank
you
may
god
bless
you
may
he
continue
to
bless
this
country
we
love
thank
you
good
afternoon
everybody
today
the
united
states
together
with
our
allies
and
partners
has
reached
historic
understanding
with
iran
which
if
fully
implemented
will
prevent
it
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
as
president
and
have
no
greater
responsibility
than
the
security
of
the
american
people
and
am
convinced
that
if
this
framework
leads
to
final
comprehensive
deal
it
will
make
our
country
our
allies
and
our
world
safer
this
has
been
long
time
coming
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
has
been
advancing
its
nuclear
program
for
decades
by
the
time
took
office
iran
was
operating
thousands
of
centrifuges
which
can
produce
the
materials
for
nuclear
bomb
and
iran
was
concealing
covert
nuclear
facility
made
clear
that
we
were
prepared
to
resolve
this
issue
diplomatically
but
only
if
iran
came
to
the
table
in
serious
way
when
that
did
not
happen
we
rallied
the
world
to
impose
the
toughest
sanctions
in
history
sanctions
which
had
profound
impact
on
the
iranian
economy
now
sanctions
alone
could
not
stop
nuclear
program
but
they
did
help
bring
iran
to
the
negotiating
table
because
of
our
diplomatic
efforts
the
world
stood
with
us
and
we
were
joined
at
the
negotiating
table
by
the
major
powers
the
united
kingdom
france
germany
russia
and
china
as
well
as
the
european
union
over
year
ago
we
took
the
first
step
towards
framework
with
deal
to
stop
the
progress
of
nuclear
program
and
roll
it
back
in
key
areas
and
recall
that
at
the
time
argued
that
iran
would
cheat
and
that
we
could
not
verify
their
compliance
and
the
interim
agreement
would
fail
instead
it
has
succeeded
exactly
as
intended
iran
has
met
all
of
its
obligations
it
eliminated
its
stockpile
of
dangerous
nuclear
material
inspections
of
program
increased
and
we
continued
negotiations
to
see
if
we
could
achieve
more
comprehensive
deal
today
after
many
months
of
tough
principled
diplomacy
we
have
achieved
the
framework
for
that
deal
and
it
is
good
deal
deal
that
meets
our
core
objectives
this
framework
would
cut
off
every
pathway
that
iran
could
take
to
develop
nuclear
weapon
iran
will
face
strict
limitations
on
its
program
and
iran
has
also
agreed
to
the
most
robust
and
intrusive
inspections
and
transparency
regime
ever
negotiated
for
any
nuclear
program
in
history
so
this
deal
is
not
based
on
trust
based
on
unprecedented
verification
many
key
details
will
be
over
the
next
three
months
and
nothing
is
agreed
to
until
everything
is
agreed
but
here
are
the
basic
outlines
of
the
deal
that
we
are
working
to
first
iran
will
not
be
able
to
pursue
bomb
using
plutonium
because
it
will
not
develop
plutonium
the
core
of
its
reactor
at
arak
will
be
dismantled
and
replaced
the
spent
fuel
from
that
facility
will
be
shipped
out
of
iran
for
the
life
of
the
reactor
iran
will
not
build
new
reactor
and
iran
will
not
reprocess
fuel
from
its
existing
reactors
ever
second
this
deal
shuts
down
path
to
bomb
using
enriched
uranium
iran
has
agreed
that
its
installed
centrifuges
will
be
reduced
by
iran
will
no
longer
enrich
uranium
at
its
facility
iran
will
not
enrich
uranium
with
its
advanced
centrifuges
for
at
least
the
next
years
the
vast
majority
of
stockpile
of
enriched
uranium
will
be
today
estimates
indicate
that
iran
is
only
two
or
three
months
away
from
potentially
acquiring
the
raw
materials
that
could
be
used
for
single
nuclear
bomb
under
this
deal
iran
has
agreed
that
it
will
not
stockpile
the
materials
needed
to
build
weapon
even
if
it
violated
the
deal
for
the
next
decade
at
least
iran
would
be
minimum
of
year
away
from
acquiring
enough
material
for
bomb
and
the
strict
limitations
on
stockpile
will
last
for
years
third
this
deal
provides
the
best
possible
against
ability
to
pursue
nuclear
weapon
covertly
that
is
in
secret
international
inspectors
will
have
unprecedented
access
not
only
to
iranian
nuclear
facilities
but
to
the
entire
supply
chain
that
supports
nuclear
program
from
uranium
mills
that
provide
the
raw
materials
to
the
centrifuge
production
and
storage
facilities
that
support
the
program
if
iran
cheats
the
world
will
know
it
if
we
see
something
suspicious
we
will
inspect
it
past
efforts
to
its
program
will
be
addressed
with
this
deal
iran
will
face
more
inspections
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
so
this
will
be
deal
that
addresses
each
path
to
potential
iranian
nuclear
bomb
there
will
be
strict
limits
on
program
for
decade
additional
restrictions
on
building
new
facilities
or
stockpiling
materials
will
last
for
years
the
unprecedented
transparency
measures
will
last
for
years
or
more
indeed
some
will
be
permanent
and
as
member
of
the
nuclear
treaty
iran
will
never
be
permitted
to
develop
nuclear
weapon
in
return
for
actions
the
international
community
has
agreed
to
provide
iran
with
relief
from
certain
sanctions
our
own
sanctions
and
international
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
nations
security
council
this
relief
will
be
phased
as
iran
takes
steps
to
adhere
to
the
deal
if
iran
violates
the
deal
sanctions
can
be
snapped
back
into
place
meanwhile
other
american
sanctions
on
iran
for
its
support
of
terrorism
its
human
rights
abuses
its
ballistic
missile
program
will
continue
to
be
fully
enforced
now
let
me
our
work
is
not
yet
done
the
deal
has
not
been
signed
between
now
and
the
end
of
june
the
negotiators
will
continue
to
work
through
the
details
of
how
this
framework
will
be
fully
implemented
and
those
details
matter
if
there
is
backsliding
on
the
part
of
the
iranians
if
the
verification
and
inspection
mechanisms
meet
the
specifications
of
our
nuclear
and
security
experts
there
will
be
no
deal
but
if
we
can
get
this
done
and
iran
follows
through
on
the
framework
that
our
negotiators
agreed
to
we
will
be
able
to
resolve
one
of
the
greatest
threats
to
our
security
and
to
do
so
peacefully
given
the
importance
of
this
issue
have
instructed
my
negotiators
to
fully
brief
congress
and
the
american
people
on
the
substance
of
the
deal
and
welcome
robust
debate
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
am
confident
that
we
can
show
that
this
deal
is
good
for
the
security
of
the
united
states
for
our
allies
and
for
the
world
for
the
fact
is
we
only
have
three
options
for
addressing
nuclear
program
first
we
can
reach
robust
and
verifiable
deal
like
this
one
and
peacefully
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
the
second
option
is
we
can
bomb
nuclear
facilities
thereby
starting
another
war
in
the
middle
east
and
setting
back
program
by
few
years
in
other
words
setting
it
back
by
fraction
of
the
time
that
this
deal
will
set
it
back
meanwhile
ensure
that
iran
would
race
ahead
to
try
and
build
bomb
third
we
could
pull
out
of
negotiations
try
to
get
other
countries
to
go
along
and
continue
sanctions
that
are
currently
in
place
or
add
additional
ones
and
hope
for
the
best
knowing
that
every
time
we
have
done
so
iran
has
not
capitulated
but
instead
has
advanced
its
program
and
that
in
very
short
order
the
breakout
would
be
eliminated
and
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
region
could
be
triggered
because
of
that
uncertainty
in
other
words
the
third
option
leads
us
very
quickly
back
to
decision
about
whether
or
not
to
take
military
action
because
have
no
idea
what
was
going
on
inside
of
iran
iran
is
not
going
to
simply
dismantle
its
program
because
we
demand
it
to
do
so
not
how
the
world
works
and
not
what
history
shows
us
iran
has
shown
no
willingness
to
eliminate
those
aspects
of
their
program
that
they
maintain
are
for
peaceful
purposes
even
in
the
face
of
unprecedented
sanctions
should
negotiations
collapse
because
we
the
united
states
rejected
what
the
majority
of
the
world
considers
fair
deal
what
our
scientists
and
nuclear
experts
suggest
would
give
us
confidence
that
they
are
not
developing
nuclear
weapon
doubtful
that
we
can
even
keep
our
current
international
sanctions
in
place
so
when
you
hear
the
inevitable
critics
of
the
deal
sound
off
ask
them
simple
question
do
you
really
think
that
this
verifiable
deal
if
fully
implemented
backed
by
the
major
powers
is
worse
option
than
the
risk
of
another
war
in
the
middle
east
is
it
worse
than
doing
what
done
for
almost
two
decades
with
iran
moving
forward
with
its
nuclear
program
and
without
robust
inspections
think
the
answer
will
be
clear
remember
have
always
insisted
that
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
iran
from
acquiring
nuclear
weapon
and
will
but
also
know
that
diplomatic
solution
is
the
best
way
to
get
this
done
and
offers
more
comprehensive
and
lasting
solution
it
is
our
best
option
by
far
and
while
it
is
always
possibility
that
iran
may
try
to
cheat
on
the
deal
in
the
future
this
framework
of
inspections
and
transparency
makes
it
far
more
likely
that
know
about
it
if
they
try
to
cheat
and
or
future
presidents
will
have
preserved
all
of
the
options
that
are
currently
available
to
deal
with
it
to
the
iranian
people
want
to
reaffirm
what
said
since
the
beginning
of
my
presidency
we
are
willing
to
engage
you
on
the
basis
of
mutual
interests
and
mutual
respect
this
deal
offers
the
prospect
of
relief
from
sanctions
that
were
imposed
because
of
violation
of
international
law
since
supreme
leader
has
issued
fatwa
against
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
this
framework
gives
iran
the
opportunity
to
verify
that
its
program
is
in
fact
peaceful
it
demonstrates
that
if
iran
complies
with
its
international
obligations
then
it
can
fully
rejoin
the
community
of
nations
thereby
fulfilling
the
extraordinary
talent
and
aspirations
of
the
iranian
people
that
would
be
good
for
iran
and
it
would
be
good
for
the
world
of
course
this
deal
alone
even
if
fully
implemented
will
not
end
the
deep
divisions
and
mistrust
between
our
two
countries
we
have
difficult
history
between
us
and
our
concerns
will
remain
with
respect
to
iranian
so
long
as
iran
continues
its
sponsorship
of
terrorism
its
support
for
proxies
who
the
middle
east
its
threats
against
friends
and
allies
like
israel
so
make
no
mistake
we
will
remain
vigilant
in
countering
those
actions
and
standing
with
our
allies
no
secret
that
the
israeli
prime
minister
and
do
agree
about
whether
the
united
states
should
move
forward
with
peaceful
resolution
to
the
iranian
issue
if
in
fact
prime
minister
is
looking
for
the
most
effective
way
to
ensure
iran
get
nuclear
weapon
this
is
the
best
option
and
believe
our
nuclear
experts
can
confirm
that
more
importantly
will
be
speaking
with
the
prime
minister
today
to
make
clear
that
there
will
be
no
daylight
there
is
no
daylight
when
it
comes
to
our
support
for
security
and
our
concerns
about
policies
and
threats
toward
israel
why
directed
my
national
security
team
to
consult
closely
with
the
new
israeli
government
in
the
coming
weeks
and
months
about
how
we
can
further
strengthen
our
security
cooperation
with
israel
and
make
clear
our
unshakeable
commitment
to
today
also
spoke
with
the
king
of
saudi
arabia
to
reaffirm
our
commitment
to
the
security
of
our
partners
in
the
gulf
and
inviting
the
leaders
of
the
six
countries
who
make
up
the
gulf
cooperation
council
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
kuwait
qatar
and
to
meet
me
at
camp
david
this
spring
to
discuss
how
we
can
further
strengthen
our
security
cooperation
while
resolving
the
multiple
conflicts
that
have
caused
so
much
hardship
and
instability
throughout
the
middle
east
finally
worth
remembering
that
congress
has
on
bipartisan
basis
played
critical
role
in
our
current
iran
policy
helping
to
shape
the
sanctions
regime
that
applied
so
much
pressure
on
iran
and
ultimately
forced
them
to
the
table
in
the
coming
days
and
weeks
my
administration
will
engage
congress
once
again
about
how
we
can
play
how
it
can
play
constructive
oversight
role
begin
that
effort
by
speaking
to
the
leaders
of
the
house
and
senate
today
in
those
conversations
will
that
the
issues
at
stake
here
are
bigger
than
politics
these
are
matters
of
war
and
peace
and
they
should
be
evaluated
based
on
the
facts
and
what
is
ultimately
best
for
the
american
people
and
for
our
national
security
for
this
is
not
simply
deal
between
my
administration
and
iran
this
is
deal
between
iran
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
major
powers
in
the
world
including
some
of
our
closest
allies
if
congress
kills
this
deal
not
based
on
expert
analysis
and
without
offering
any
reasonable
alternative
then
the
united
states
that
will
be
blamed
for
the
failure
of
diplomacy
international
unity
will
collapse
and
the
path
to
conflict
will
widen
the
american
people
understand
this
which
is
why
solid
majorities
support
diplomatic
resolution
to
the
iranian
nuclear
issue
they
understand
instinctively
the
words
of
president
kennedy
who
faced
down
the
far
greater
threat
of
communism
and
said
us
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
but
let
us
never
fear
to
the
american
people
remember
that
at
the
height
of
the
cold
war
presidents
like
nixon
and
struck
historic
arms
control
agreements
with
the
soviet
union
far
more
dangerous
adversary
despite
the
fact
that
that
adversary
not
only
threatened
to
destroy
our
country
and
our
way
of
life
but
had
the
means
to
do
so
those
agreements
were
not
perfect
they
did
not
end
all
threats
but
they
made
our
world
safer
good
deal
with
iran
will
do
the
same
today
like
to
express
my
thanks
to
our
international
partners
for
their
steadfastness
and
their
cooperation
was
able
to
speak
earlier
today
with
our
close
allies
prime
minister
and
president
and
chancellor
to
reaffirm
that
we
stand
in
this
effort
and
most
of
all
on
behalf
of
our
nation
want
to
express
my
thanks
to
our
tireless
and
mean
tireless
secretary
of
state
john
and
our
entire
negotiating
team
they
have
worked
so
hard
to
make
this
progress
they
represent
the
best
tradition
of
american
diplomacy
their
work
our
work
is
not
yet
done
and
success
is
not
guaranteed
but
we
have
an
historic
opportunity
to
prevent
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
in
iran
and
to
do
so
peacefully
with
the
international
community
firmly
behind
us
we
should
seize
that
chance
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
president
thank
you
very
much
panama
for
hosting
this
summit
of
the
and
thank
everybody
here
from
across
the
region
for
the
courageous
work
that
you
do
to
defend
freedom
and
human
rights
and
to
promote
equality
and
opportunity
and
justice
across
our
hemisphere
and
around
the
world
am
proud
to
be
with
you
at
this
official
gathering
of
civil
society
leaders
at
the
summit
of
the
and
pleased
to
have
cuba
represented
with
us
at
this
summit
for
the
very
first
time
here
for
very
simple
reason
we
believe
that
strong
successful
countries
require
strong
and
vibrant
civil
societies
we
know
that
throughout
our
history
human
progress
has
been
propelled
not
just
by
famous
leaders
not
just
by
states
but
by
ordinary
men
and
women
who
believe
that
change
is
possible
by
citizens
who
are
willing
to
stand
up
against
incredible
odds
and
great
danger
not
only
to
protect
their
own
rights
but
to
extend
rights
to
others
had
chance
to
reflect
on
this
last
month
when
was
in
the
small
town
of
alabama
some
of
you
may
have
heard
of
it
place
where
years
ago
marched
in
peaceful
nonviolent
protest
not
to
ask
for
special
treatment
but
to
be
treated
equally
in
accordance
with
the
founding
documents
of
our
declaration
of
independence
our
bill
of
rights
they
were
part
of
civil
rights
movement
that
had
endured
violence
and
repression
for
decades
and
would
endure
it
again
that
day
as
many
of
the
marchers
were
beaten
but
they
kept
marching
and
despite
the
beatings
of
that
day
they
came
back
and
more
returned
and
the
conscience
of
nation
was
stirred
their
efforts
bent
in
the
words
of
martin
luther
king
the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
towards
justice
and
it
was
their
vision
for
more
fair
and
just
and
inclusive
and
generous
society
that
ultimately
triumphed
and
the
only
reason
stand
here
today
as
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
because
those
ordinary
people
maids
and
janitors
and
schoolteachers
were
willing
to
endure
hardship
on
my
behalf
and
that
why
believe
so
strongly
in
the
work
that
you
do
it
the
dreamers
no
matter
how
humble
or
poor
or
seemingly
powerless
that
are
able
to
change
the
course
of
human
events
we
saw
it
in
south
africa
where
citizens
stood
up
to
the
scourge
of
we
saw
it
in
europe
where
poles
marched
in
solidarity
to
help
bring
down
the
iron
curtain
in
where
mothers
of
the
disappeared
spoke
out
against
the
dirty
war
the
story
of
my
country
where
citizens
worked
to
abolish
slavery
and
establish
rights
and
rights
and
rights
for
gays
and
lesbians
not
to
say
that
my
country
is
perfect
we
are
not
and
the
point
we
always
have
to
have
citizens
who
are
willing
to
question
and
push
our
government
and
identify
injustice
we
have
to
wrestle
with
our
own
challenges
from
issues
of
race
to
policing
to
inequality
but
what
makes
me
most
proud
about
the
extraordinary
example
of
the
united
states
is
not
that
perfect
but
that
we
struggle
with
it
and
we
have
this
open
space
in
which
society
can
continually
try
to
make
us
more
perfect
union
stood
up
at
great
cost
for
freedom
and
human
dignity
not
just
in
our
own
country
but
elsewhere
proud
of
that
and
we
embrace
our
ability
to
become
better
through
our
democracy
and
that
requires
more
than
just
the
work
of
government
it
demands
the
hard
and
frustrating
sometimes
but
absolutely
vital
work
of
ordinary
citizens
coming
together
to
make
common
cause
so
civil
society
is
the
conscience
of
our
countries
the
catalyst
of
change
why
strong
nations
fear
active
citizens
strong
nations
embrace
and
support
and
empower
active
citizens
and
by
the
way
not
as
if
active
citizens
are
always
right
not
sometimes
people
start
yelling
at
me
or
arguing
at
me
and
think
you
know
what
talking
about
but
sometimes
they
do
and
the
question
is
not
whether
always
right
the
question
is
do
you
have
society
in
which
that
conversation
that
debate
can
be
tested
and
ideas
are
tested
in
the
marketplace
and
because
of
the
efforts
of
civil
society
now
by
and
large
consensus
in
the
on
democracy
and
human
rights
and
social
development
and
social
inclusiveness
strong
differences
about
the
role
of
civil
society
but
believe
we
can
all
benefit
from
open
and
tolerant
and
inclusive
dialogue
and
we
should
reject
violence
or
intimidation
aimed
at
silencing
voices
the
freedom
to
be
heard
is
principle
that
the
at
large
is
committed
to
and
that
mean
as
said
that
going
to
agree
on
every
issue
but
we
should
address
those
issue
candidly
and
honestly
and
civilly
and
welcome
the
voices
of
all
of
our
people
into
the
debates
that
shape
the
future
of
the
hemisphere
just
to
take
one
example
as
the
united
states
begins
new
chapter
in
our
relationship
with
cuba
we
hope
it
will
create
an
environment
that
improves
the
lives
of
the
cuban
people
not
because
imposed
by
us
the
united
states
but
through
the
talent
and
ingenuity
and
aspirations
and
the
conversation
among
cubans
from
all
walks
of
life
so
they
can
decide
what
the
best
course
is
for
their
prosperity
as
we
move
toward
the
process
of
have
our
differences
government
to
government
with
cuba
on
many
issues
just
as
we
differ
at
times
with
other
nations
within
the
just
as
we
differ
with
our
closest
allies
nothing
wrong
with
that
but
here
to
say
that
when
we
do
speak
out
going
to
do
so
because
the
united
states
of
america
does
believe
and
will
always
stand
for
certain
set
of
universal
values
and
when
we
do
partner
with
civil
society
because
we
believe
our
relationship
should
be
with
governments
and
with
the
peoples
that
they
represent
also
because
we
believe
that
your
work
is
more
important
than
ever
here
in
the
inequality
still
locks
too
many
people
out
of
our
economies
discrimination
still
locks
too
many
out
of
our
societies
around
the
world
there
are
still
too
many
places
where
laws
are
passed
to
stifle
civil
society
where
governments
cut
off
funding
for
groups
that
they
agree
with
where
entrepreneurs
are
crushed
under
corruption
where
activists
and
journalists
are
locked
up
on
charges
because
they
dare
to
be
critical
of
their
governments
where
the
way
you
look
or
how
you
pray
or
who
you
love
can
get
you
imprisoned
or
killed
and
whether
crackdowns
on
free
expression
in
russia
or
china
or
restrictions
on
freedom
of
association
and
assembly
in
egypt
or
prison
camps
run
by
the
north
korean
regime
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedoms
are
still
at
risk
around
the
world
and
when
that
happens
we
believe
we
have
moral
obligation
to
speak
out
we
also
know
that
our
support
for
civil
society
is
not
just
about
what
against
but
also
what
for
because
noticed
that
governments
that
are
more
responsive
and
effective
are
typically
governments
where
the
people
are
free
to
assemble
and
speak
their
minds
and
petition
their
leaders
and
hold
us
accountable
we
know
that
our
economies
attract
more
trade
and
investment
when
citizens
are
free
to
start
new
business
without
paying
bribe
we
know
that
our
societies
are
more
likely
to
succeed
when
all
our
people
regardless
of
or
class
or
creed
or
sexual
orientation
or
gender
are
free
to
live
and
pray
and
love
as
they
choose
what
we
believe
and
increasingly
civil
society
is
source
of
ideas
about
everything
from
promoting
transparency
and
free
expression
to
reversing
inequality
and
rescuing
our
environment
and
why
as
part
of
our
stand
with
civil
society
initiative
joined
with
people
around
the
world
to
push
back
on
those
who
deny
your
right
to
be
heard
made
it
mission
of
our
government
not
only
to
protect
civil
society
groups
but
to
partner
with
you
and
empower
you
with
the
knowledge
and
the
technology
and
the
resources
to
put
your
ideas
into
action
and
the
supports
the
efforts
to
establish
permanent
meaningful
role
for
civil
societies
in
future
summits
of
the
so
let
me
just
say
when
the
united
states
sees
space
closing
for
civil
society
we
will
work
to
open
it
when
efforts
are
made
to
wall
you
off
from
the
world
try
to
connect
you
with
each
other
when
you
are
silenced
try
to
speak
out
alongside
you
and
when
suppressed
we
want
to
help
strengthen
you
as
you
work
for
change
the
united
states
will
stand
up
alongside
you
every
step
of
the
way
we
are
respectful
of
the
difference
among
our
countries
the
days
in
which
our
agenda
in
this
hemisphere
so
often
presumed
that
the
united
states
could
meddle
with
impunity
those
days
are
past
but
what
it
does
mean
but
we
do
have
to
be
very
clear
that
when
we
speak
out
on
behalf
of
somebody
been
imprisoned
for
no
other
reason
than
because
they
spoke
truth
to
power
when
we
are
helping
an
that
is
trying
to
empower
minority
group
inside
country
to
get
more
access
to
resources
not
doing
that
because
it
serves
our
own
interests
doing
it
because
we
think
the
right
thing
to
do
and
important
and
hope
that
all
the
other
countries
at
the
summit
of
the
will
join
us
in
seeing
that
important
because
sometimes
as
difficult
as
it
is
important
for
us
to
be
able
to
speak
honestly
and
candidly
on
behalf
of
people
who
are
vulnerable
and
people
who
are
powerless
people
who
are
voiceless
know
because
there
was
time
in
our
own
country
where
there
were
groups
that
were
voiceless
and
powerless
and
because
of
world
opinion
that
helped
to
change
those
circumstance
we
have
debt
to
pay
because
the
voices
of
ordinary
people
have
made
us
better
debt
that
want
to
make
sure
we
repay
in
this
hemisphere
and
around
the
world
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
want
to
begin
by
once

new
commitments
to
help
lift
up
young
people
in
the
region
new
partnerships
to
protect
this
beautiful
land
and
our
planet
as
said
this
morning
the
united
states
is
more
deeply
engaged
across
the
region
than
we
have
been
in
decades
and
believe
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
is
as
good
as
it
has
ever
been
focused
on
the
future
and
what
we
can
build
and
achieve
together
and
our
engagement
with
the
countries
and
peoples
of
the
is
going
to
continue
throughout
the
remainder
of
my
presidency
so
with
that
let
me
take
some
questions
start
with
question
thank
you
president
sir
you
head
back
to
the
united
states
with
the
task
of
convincing
the
american
people
and
congress
on
two
major
foreign
policy
initiatives
the
framework
for
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
likely
soon
the
decision
to
remove
cuba
from
list
of
state
sponsors
of
terror
recent
remarks
by
supreme
leader
have
raised
doubts
among
some
as
to
whether
that
deal
can
occur
in
iran
and
senator
an
ally
of
yours
has
wants
congress
to
have
the
right
to
vote
on
removal
of
sanctions
presidential
politics
are
likely
to
play
part
in
this
cuba
decision
inevitably
so
wondering
if
it
would
take
lot
of
political
capital
just
to
get
one
done
let
alone
two
have
you
bitten
off
more
than
you
can
chew
president
no
you
may
be
surprised
by
that
response
let
me
take
them
in
turn
first
of
all
with
respect
to
cuba
there
is
majority
support
of
our
policy
in
the
united
states
and
overwhelming
support
for
our
policy
in
cuba
think
people
that
if
you
keep
on
doing
something
for
years
and
it
work
you
should
try
something
new
and
so
the
american
people
need
to
be
persuaded
that
this
is
in
fact
the
right
thing
to
do
that
there
are
still
concerns
and
questions
that
congress
may
have
got
concerns
and
questions
about
specific
activities
that
are
taking
place
in
cuba
and
human
rights
and
reform
and
there
were
two
members
of
the
cuban
civil
society
that
were
in
attendance
at
the
meeting
that
had
yesterday
who
expressed
much
of
what
they
have
to
go
through
on
basis
they
were
supportive
of
our
policy
of
engagement
with
cuba
and
so
think
that
so
much
we
have
to
persuade
anybody
the
issue
of
the
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
list
as
you
know
the
state
department
has
provided
recommendation
gone
through
our
process
be
honest
with
you
have
been
on
the
road
and
want
to
make
sure
that
have
chance
to
read
it
study
it
before
we
announce
publicly
what
the
policy
outcome
is
going
to
be
but
in
terms
of
the
overall
direction
of
cuba
policy
think
there
is
strong
majority
both
in
the
united
states
and
in
cuba
that
says
our
ability
to
engage
to
open
up
commerce
and
travel
and
exchanges
is
ultimately
going
to
be
good
for
the
cuban
people
now
with
respect
to
iran
have
always
been
clear
we
are
not
done
yet
what
we
were
able
to
obtain
was
political
framework
between
the
nations
and
iran
that
provided
unprecedented
verification
of
what
is
taking
place
in
iran
over
the
next
two
decades
that
significantly
cuts
back
on
its
centrifuges
that
cuts
of
pathways
for
it
to
obtain
nuclear
weapon
and
that
calls
for
in
return
the
rolling
back
of
sanctions
in
phased
way
that
allows
us
to
snap
back
if
iran
violates
the
agreement
the
political
framework
that
was
not
just
something
that
the
united
states
and
iran
agreed
to
but
iran
agreed
to
political
framework
with
the
other
nations
now
always
been
clear
is
is
that
iran
has
its
own
politics
around
this
issue
they
have
their
own
hardliners
they
have
their
own
impulses
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
to
go
forward
with
something
just
as
we
have
in
our
country
and
so
not
surprising
to
me
that
the
supreme
leader
or
whole
bunch
of
other
people
are
going
to
try
to
the
deal
in
way
that
protects
their
political
position
but
know
what
was
discussed
at
in
arriving
at
the
political
agreement
what
always
said
though
is
that
the
possibility
of
backsliding
the
possibility
that
it
get
in
way
that
satisfies
us
that
able
to
verify
that
in
fact
iran
is
not
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
that
we
are
preserving
the
capacity
to
snap
back
sanctions
in
the
event
that
they
are
breaking
any
deal
and
why
the
work
is
going
to
be
so
important
between
now
and
the
end
of
june
to
this
so
that
we
can
all
examine
it
and
we
have
to
speculate
on
what
the
meaning
of
deal
is
going
to
be
either
going
to
be
document
that
iran
agrees
with
the
world
community
about
and
series
of
actions
that
have
to
be
taken
or
not
part
of
the
challenge
in
this
whole
process
has
been
opponents
of
basically
any
deal
with
iran
have
constantly
tried
to
what
the
deal
is
without
seeing
it
now
if
we
are
able
to
obtain
final
deal
that
with
the
political
agreement
and
say
because
not
yet
final
then
absolutely
positive
that
that
is
the
best
way
to
prevent
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
not
my
opinion
the
opinion
of
people
like
my
secretary
of
energy
who
is
physicist
from
and
actually
knows
something
about
this
stuff
the
opinion
of
whole
bunch
of
nuclear
experts
who
examined
the
deal
very
rarely
do
you
see
consensus
is
too
strong
word
large
majority
of
people
who
are
experts
in
the
field
saying
this
is
actually
realistic
plausible
meaningful
approach
to
cut
off
the
pathways
for
iran
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
that
it
is
more
likely
to
succeed
not
only
than
maintaining
current
sanctions
or
additional
sanctions
but
more
likely
to
succeed
than
if
we
took
military
approach
to
solving
the
problem
again
not
uniquely
my
opinion
that
is
talk
to
people
who
are
not
affiliated
with
the
administration
some
of
whom
were
about
our
capacity
to
get
deal
done
and
have
now
looked
at
it
and
said
if
able
to
actually
get
what
was
discussed
in
the
political
framework
absolutely
the
right
thing
to
do
now
politics
and
political
pressure
inside
of
the
united
states
we
all
know
that
the
prime
minister
of
israel
is
deeply
opposed
to
it
think
made
that
very
clear
have
repeatedly
asked
what
is
the
alternative
that
you
present
that
you
think
makes
it
less
likely
for
iran
to
get
nuclear
weapon
and
have
yet
to
obtain
good
answer
on
that
that
and
the
narrow
question
going
to
be
presented
next
week
when
congress
comes
back
is
appropriate
role
in
looking
at
final
deal
and
talked
to
not
only
bob
but
talked
to
ben
the
ranking
member
on
the
democratic
side
and
want
to
work
with
them
so
that
congress
can
look
at
this
deal
when
done
what
concerned
about
is
making
sure
that
we
prejudge
it
or
those
who
are
opposed
to
any
deal
whatsoever
try
to
use
procedural
argument
essentially
to
screw
up
the
possibility
of
deal
last
comment
going
to
make
on
this
when
hear
some
like
senator
recently
suggest
that
our
secretary
of
state
john
who
served
in
the
united
states
senate
veteran
provided
exemplary
service
to
this
nation
is
somehow
less
trustworthy
in
the
interpretation
of
in
political
agreement
than
the
supreme
leader
of
iran
an
indication
of
the
degree
to
which
partisanship
has
crossed
all
boundaries
and
seeing
this
again
and
again
we
saw
it
with
the
letter
by
the
senators
who
communicated
directly
to
the
supreme
leader
of
iran
the
person
that
they
say
be
trusted
at
all
warning
him
not
to
trust
the
united
states
government
we
have
trying
to
tell
the
world
oh
have
confidence
in
the
abilities
to
any
climate
change
pledge
that
we
might
make
and
now
we
have
senator
suggesting
that
our
secretary
of
state
is
purposely
misinterpreting
the
deal
and
giving
the
supreme
leader
of
iran
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
the
interpretations
not
how
supposed
to
run
foreign
policy
regardless
of
president
or
secretary
of
state
we
can
have
arguments
and
there
are
legitimate
arguments
to
be
had
understand
why
people
might
be
mistrustful
of
iran
understand
why
people
might
oppose
the
deal
although
the
reason
is
not
because
this
is
bad
deal
per
but
they
just
trust
any
deal
with
iran
and
may
prefer
to
take
military
approach
to
it
but
when
you
start
getting
to
the
point
where
you
are
actively
communicating
that
the
united
states
government
and
our
secretary
of
state
is
somehow
spinning
presentations
in
negotiation
with
foreign
power
particularly
one
that
you
say
is
your
enemy
problem
it
needs
to
stop
oh
sorry
question
right
here
president
there
you
are
question
thank
you
very
much
president
was
wondering
if
you
were
struck
by
warm
words
for
you
today
he
said
he
admired
you
said
he
had
read
some
of
your
autobiographies
described
you
as
an
honest
man
just
curious
what
you
thought
about
that
and
do
you
feel
that
is
an
honest
man
and
can
be
trusted
and
would
be
remiss
if
ask
you
about
another
secretary
of
state
who
is
expected
to
announce
her
campaign
for
the
presidency
tomorrow
do
you
foresee
being
involved
in
her
campaign
and
do
you
hope
that
she
runs
on
your
record
thank
you
very
much
president
it
was
candid
and
fruitful
conversation
between
me
and
can
tell
you
that
in
the
conversations
had
so
far
with
him
two
on
the
phone
and
most
recently
that
we
are
able
to
speak
honestly
about
our
differences
and
our
concerns
in
ways
that
think
offer
the
possibility
of
moving
the
relationship
between
our
two
countries
in
different
and
better
direction
we
have
very
different
views
of
how
society
should
be
and
was
very
direct
with
him
that
we
are
not
going
to
stop
talking
about
issues
like
democracy
and
human
rights
and
freedom
of
assembly
and
freedom
of
the
press
not
because
we
think
we
are
perfect
and
that
every
country
has
to
mimic
us
exactly
but
because
there
are
set
of
universal
principles
for
which
we
stand
and
one
of
the
goals
of
my
administration
is
to
have
some
consistency
in
speaking
out
on
behalf
of
those
who
have
voice
and
think
during
his
in
the
plenary
session
he
was
pretty
clear
about
areas
of
policy
he
like
and
suspect
going
to
continue
to
speak
out
on
those
been
clear
from
this
entire
summit
though
is
the
unanimity
with
which
regardless
of
their
ideological
predispositions
the
leaders
of
latin
america
think
this
is
the
right
thing
to
do
because
what
they
see
is
the
possibility
of
more
constructive
dialogue
that
ultimately
benefits
the
cuban
people
and
removes
what
too
often
has
been
distraction
or
an
excuse
from
the
hemisphere
acting
on
important
challenges
that
we
face
so
am
cautiously
optimistic
that
over
the
coming
months
and
coming
years
that
the
process
that
initiated
first
announced
in
december
reaffirmed
here
at
the
summit
of
the
will
lead
to
different
future
for
the
cuban
people
and
different
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
with
respect
to
make
my
comments
very
brief
she
was
formidable
candidate
in
she
was
great
supporter
of
mine
in
the
general
election
she
was
an
outstanding
secretary
of
state
she
is
my
friend
think
she
would
be
an
excellent
president
and
not
on
the
ballot
so
not
going
to
step
on
her
lines
when
she
makes
decision
to
announce
confident
that
she
will
be
very
clear
about
her
vision
for
the
country
moving
forward
if
she
announces
and
in
terms
of
her
relationship
with
my
administration
she
was
focused
and
working
on
really
important
foreign
policy
initiatives
and
the
one
thing
can
say
is
that
going
to
be
able
to
handle
herself
very
well
in
any
conversations
or
debates
around
foreign
policy
and
her
track
record
with
respect
to
domestic
policy
is
think
one
that
cares
about
working
families
if
she
decides
to
run
and
she
makes
an
announcement
going
to
have
some
strong
messages
to
deliver
question
thank
you
president
first
of
all
on
cuba
if
could
two
questions
the
cuban
government
has
frequently
said
that
it
can
not
allow
more
political
or
personal
freedoms
or
press
freedoms
because
the
united
states
has
used
both
covert
and
otherwise
actions
to
try
to
overthrow
the
does
your
new
era
in
fact
end
efforts
by
the
united
states
and
should
the
cubans
then
respond
by
allowing
free
elections
and
tolerance
of
dissent
now
because
of
the
changed
policy
and
secondly
on
the
issue
of
vice
president
of
course
said
that
the
democratic
race
is
wide
open
the
polls
seem
to
say
otherwise
what
is
your
opinion
on
that
is
the
race
still
wide
open
president
not
only
have
run
my
last
election
but
am
not
in
the
business
of
future
elections
that
is
your
job
laughter
and
no
shortage
of
people
who
are
happy
to
opine
on
that
will
not
be
one
of
them
on
cuba
we
are
not
in
the
business
of
regime
change
we
are
in
the
business
of
making
sure
the
cuban
people
have
freedom
and
the
ability
to
participate
and
shape
their
own
destiny
and
their
own
lives
and
supporting
civil
society
and
going
to
be
an
evolution
regardless
of
what
we
do
inside
of
cuba
partly
it
going
to
be
generational
if
you
listened
to
president
comments
earlier
this
morning
lot
of
the
points
he
made
referenced
actions
that
took
place
before
was
born
and
part
of
my
message
here
is
the
cold
war
is
over
still
whole
lot
of
challenges
that
we
face
and
lot
of
issues
around
the
world
and
we
still
going
to
have
serious
issues
with
cuba
on
not
just
the
cuban
approach
to
its
own
people
but
also
regional
issues
and
concerns
there
are
going
to
be
areas
where
we
cooperate
as
well
cuban
doctors
deployed
during
the
crisis
made
difference
cuban
activity
in
haiti
in
the
wake
of
the
earthquake
made
difference
and
so
there
may
be
areas
of
collaboration
as
well
what
said
to
president
is
the
same
thing
that
said
to
leaders
throughout
the
region
we
have
point
of
view
and
we
be
shy
about
expressing
it
but
confident
that
the
way
to
lift
up
the
values
that
we
care
about
is
through
persuasion
and
that
going
to
be
the
primary
approach
that
we
take
on
whole
host
of
these
issues
primarily
because
they
do
implicate
our
national
security
in
direct
way
and
think
that
we
have
to
be
very
clear
if
cuba
is
not
threat
to
the
united
states
that
mean
we
do
have
differences
with
it
but
on
the
list
of
threats
that
concerned
about
think
it
fair
to
say
that
between
and
iran
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
activities
in
yemen
and
libya
and
russian
aggression
in
ukraine
and
the
impact
on
our
allies
there
could
go
down
pretty
long
list
climate
change
so
think
our
approach
has
to
be
one
of
trying
to
work
with
the
region
and
other
countries
and
be
very
clear
about
what
we
believe
and
what
we
stand
for
and
what
we
think
works
and
what
and
so
often
when
we
insert
ourselves
in
ways
that
go
beyond
persuasion
it
counterproductive
it
backfires
that
been
part
of
our
history
which
is
why
countries
keep
on
trying
to
use
us
as
an
excuse
for
their
own
governance
failures
take
away
the
excuse
and
be
clear
that
we
prepared
to
partner
and
engage
with
everybody
to
try
to
lift
up
opportunity
and
prosperity
and
security
for
people
in
the
region
major
question
good
afternoon
president
allow
me
if
you
will
to
correct
to
quote
the
supreme
leader
directly
president
yes
question
the
united
states
activity
since
the
announcement
of
the
framework
has
been
deceptive
it
is
lying
it
is
devilish
and
on
two
particular
points
he
said
direct
quotes
military
sites
can
not
be
inspected
under
the
excuse
of
nuclear
supervision
and
sanctions
should
be
removed
when
the
deal
is
is
it
your
opinion
president
that
this
is
pure
posturing
and
it
should
be
disregarded
by
your
government
and
by
you
and
your
secretary
of
state
and
if
so
could
you
help
me
understand
to
whom
the
supreme
leader
would
be
posturing
because
under
my
limited
understanding
of
iranian
politics
that
not
job
description
usually
applied
to
the
supreme
leader
president
that
was
question
major
and
let
me
just
suggest
that
even
guy
with
the
title
has
to
be
concerned
about
his
own
constituencies
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
have
to
take
his
word
for
whether
that
his
understanding
because
we
got
work
until
the
end
of
june
to
see
if
we
got
document
that
works
and
if
that
is
his
understanding
and
his
position
in
ways
that
be
squared
with
our
concern
about
being
able
to
embark
on
vigorous
inspections
to
assure
that
iran
is
cheating
under
any
program
and
that
we
do
have
the
capacity
to
snap
back
sanctions
when
we
see
potential
violation
then
we
probably
not
going
to
get
deal
so
part
of
the
concern
that
have
in
this
debate
here
major
is
do
understand
why
it
is
that
everybody
is
working
so
hard
to
anticipate
failure
the
opponents
of
the
deal
do
seem
to
be
focused
on
how
do
we
get
to
good
deal
as
much
as
focused
on
how
can
we
show
that
it
not
possible
to
get
good
deal
and
my
simple
point
is
wait
and
see
what
the
deal
is
and
we
be
able
to
look
and
if
in
fact
we
not
satisfied
that
it
cuts
off
the
pathways
for
iran
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
then
we
sign
it
if
on
the
other
hand
it
does
then
will
strongly
argue
and
believe
the
american
people
will
support
and
the
international
community
will
support
that
far
preferable
to
the
other
alternatives
now
major
it
not
going
to
be
perfect
in
the
sense
that
if
you
asked
prime
minister
or
some
members
of
the
republican
caucus
or
even
some
democrats
if
you
ask
me
would
prefer
that
iran
never
had
never
did
have
will
never
have
even
single
nut
bolt
anything
related
to
nuclear
power
do
have
any
nuclear
scientists
do
have
any
capacity
to
develop
it
that
would
be
great
but
that
not
possible
that
not
achievable
that
not
achievable
through
sanctions
it
not
achievable
through
military
means
going
to
have
some
form
of
peaceful
nuclear
power
and
that
will
then
pose
challenge
for
the
international
community
which
is
why
the
political
agreement
calls
for
unprecedented
framework
of
inspections
that
allows
us
to
assure
that
not
being
used
or
diverted
in
ways
that
could
be
but
going
to
have
to
see
whether
or
not
we
can
get
deal
or
not
my
only
question
is
why
we
keep
on
trying
to
the
actual
negotiations
nobody
is
not
disarming
not
getting
rid
of
our
nuclear
weapons
not
getting
rid
of
our
navy
not
giving
anything
up
we
are
simply
waiting
to
see
what
it
is
that
the
negotiators
come
up
with
and
if
in
fact
we
are
able
to
come
up
with
something
that
works
then
know
and
with
respect
to
the
supreme
leader
yes
pretty
important
title
it
seems
little
more
than
president
on
the
other
hand
there
may
be
ways
of
structuring
final
deal
that
satisfy
their
pride
their
optics
their
politics
but
meet
our
core
practical
objectives
and
what
got
to
give
the
negotiators
room
to
determine
last
question
there
she
is
question
thank
you
just
to
the
point
on
that
question
president
your
people
have
said
that
the
framework
agreement
that
in
it
stands
that
they
are
not
points
although
the
implementation
of
them
can
be
renegotiated
in
some
way
and
wonder
how
within
that
framework
already
been
agreed
how
we
can
come
up
with
something
that
satisfies
the
kinds
of
concerns
that
he
raised
no
inspection
of
military
sites
immediate
lifting
of
all
sanctions
the
day
that
the
thing
is
signed
and
also
on
cuba
wanted
to
ask
as
you
discussed
the
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
list
with
president
the
cubans
have
raised
some
issues
about
the
waiting
period
wondered
if
that
came
up
know
that
your
government
is
eager
assuming
that
the
recommendation
is
approved
is
to
remove
it
and
is
approved
by
you
that
we
move
ahead
quickly
with
embassies
the
cubans
have
raised
concerns
about
that
days
and
how
something
could
go
wrong
in
those
days
and
it
really
give
them
access
to
the
kinds
of
things
they
think
they
can
have
once
if
and
when
removed
from
the
list
did
that
come
up
and
is
it
your
belief
that
once
removed
from
the
list
then
there
is
no
impediment
to
go
ahead
with
opening
embassies
once
you
approve
their
removal
from
the
list
president
okay
so
make
one
last
run
at
iran
here
political
framework
the
outlines
of
which
were
established
between
iran
and
the
in
some
cases
there
was
great
specificity
around
for
example
the
reductions
that
need
to
take
place
in
the
number
of
centrifuges
in
or
the
conversion
of
into
facility
that
does
not
permit
the
potential
production
of
uranium
and
in
other
cases
there
were
there
was
language
of
intent
but
the
details
matter
and
how
those
details
are
interpreted
are
going
to
be
subject
to
negotiation
so
not
accurate
to
suggest
that
and
think
my
team
has
ever
suggested
that
somehow
everything
is
all
done
and
just
matter
of
writing
it
up
this
is
situation
in
which
we
have
framework
that
is
if
implemented
powerful
and
will
achieve
our
goal
of
making
sure
that
iran
have
nuclear
weapon
but
the
details
make
big
difference
how
structured
and
guarantee
you
there
will
be
some
tough
negotiations
around
that
and
what
said
the
first
day
when
we
announced
that
we
had
an
agreement
and
what
continued
to
say
so
really
no
contradiction
here
and
keep
in
mind
that
when
we
started
this
process
off
even
with
the
interim
agreement
when
we
signed
the
way
back
at
the
beginning
of
this
whole
thing
there
was
similar
in
terms
of
interpretation
of
how
this
was
going
to
be
implemented
and
the
iranians
were
saying
not
true
and
we
were
saying
this
but
once
we
actually
got
through
negotiations
it
turned
out
that
we
had
something
that
was
substantial
that
was
subject
to
review
by
everybody
involved
and
that
has
proven
to
be
highly
effective
even
by
the
assessments
of
critics
of
the
policy
like
the
israelis
said
yes
this
actually
has
worked
iran
has
abided
by
the
agreement
in
fact
now
suggesting
why
we
just
stay
here
worked
so
well
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
made
almost
the
precise
same
argument
making
now
about
the
final
deal
but
consistency
is
the
hobgoblin
of
narrow
minds
cuba
will
tell
you
we
did
not
get
into
the
level
of
detail
that
you
just
described
and
impressed
with
how
many
details
you
seem
to
be
aware
of
as
said
before
the
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
recommendation
will
be
coming
to
me
will
read
it
review
it
process
whereby
if
in
fact
accept
those
recommendations
congress
has
an
opportunity
to
review
it
as
well
and
it
will
be
there
for
people
to
see
think
that
the
concerns
around
the
embassy
are
going
to
be
mostly
on
the
cuban
side
they
dealt
with
an
american
embassy
in
cuba
in
quite
some
time
and
changing
in
this
way
is
sure
an
unsettling
process
accustomed
to
this
mean
gone
through
now
number
of
times
where
with
china
and
with
and
other
countries
we
reopened
diplomatic
relations
and
we
understand
think
are
familiar
with
how
that
gets
done
in
way
consistent
with
improving
diplomatic
relations
over
the
long
term
this
is
probably
more
profound
shift
for
them
than
it
is
for
us
but
we
stand
ready
to
move
forward
confident
that
it
can
lead
to
an
improved
dialogue
and
our
bottom
line
at
the
end
is
is
that
it
can
lead
to
an
improved
set
of
prospects
for
the
cuban
people
and
say
just
in
closing
to
all
the
people
here
from
latin
american
countries
thank
you
for
this
extraordinary
opportunity
want
to
thank
the
people
of
panama
am
very
optimistic
about
this
region
and
the
main
reason
optimistic
about
this
region
is
because
of
its
people
they
are
extraordinary
and
it
is
great
gift
to
the
united
states
to
be
able
to
have
such
strong
friends
and
partners
in
tackling
many
of
the
challenges
that
we
have
in
common
thank
you
very
much
let
me
begin
by
thanking
president
and
the
government
for
their
leadership
in
hosting
this
summit
of
the
president
to
you
and
the
people
of
panama
city
and
all
the
people
of
panama
thank
you
for
your
extraordinary
hospitality
and
your
outstanding
arrangements
too
want
to
express
my
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
people
of
as
managing
through
very
difficult
time
and
look
forward
to
seeing
president
at
future
summit
when
came
to
my
first
summit
of
the
six
years
ago
promised
to
begin
new
chapter
of
engagement
in
this
region
believed
that
our
nations
had
to
break
free
from
the
old
arguments
the
old
grievances
that
had
too
often
trapped
us
in
the
past
that
we
had
shared
responsibility
to
look
to
the
future
and
to
think
and
act
in
fresh
ways
pledged
to
build
new
era
of
cooperation
between
our
countries
as
equal
partners
based
on
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
said
that
this
new
approach
would
be
sustained
throughout
my
presidency
it
has
including
during
this
past
year
met
that
commitment
we
come
together
at
historic
time
as
has
already
been
noted
the
changes
that
announced
to
policy
toward
cuba
mark
the
beginning
of
new
relationship
between
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
the
people
of
cuba
it
will
mean
as
already
seeing
more
americans
to
cuba
more
cultural
exchanges
more
commerce
more
potential
investment
but
most
of
all
it
will
mean
more
opportunity
and
resources
for
the
cuban
people
and
we
hope
to
be
able
to
help
on
humanitarian
projects
and
provide
more
access
to
telecommunications
and
the
internet
and
the
free
flow
of
information
we
continue
to
make
progress
towards
fulfilling
our
shared
commitments
to
formally
diplomatic
relations
and
have
called
on
congress
to
begin
working
to
lift
the
embargo
been
in
place
for
decades
the
point
is
the
united
states
will
not
be
imprisoned
by
the
past
looking
to
the
future
and
to
policies
that
improve
the
lives
of
the
cuban
people
and
advance
the
interests
of
cooperation
in
the
hemisphere
this
shift
in
policy
represents
turning
point
for
our
entire
region
the
fact
that
president
and
are
both
sitting
here
today
marks
historic
occasion
this
is
the
first
time
in
more
than
half
century
that
all
the
nations
of
the
are
meeting
to
address
our
future
together
think
no
secret
and
president
sure
would
agree
that
there
will
continue
to
be
significant
differences
between
our
two
countries
we
will
continue
to
speak
out
on
behalf
of
universal
values
that
we
think
are
important
sure
president
will
continue
to
speak
out
on
the
issues
he
thinks
are
important
but
firmly
believe
that
if
we
can
continue
to
move
forward
and
seize
this
momentum
in
pursuit
of
mutual
interests
then
better
relations
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
will
create
new
opportunities
for
cooperation
across
our
region
for
the
security
and
prosperity
and
health
and
dignity
of
all
our
people
now
alongside
our
shift
toward
cuba
the
united
states
has
deepened
our
engagement
in
the
across
the
board
since
took
office
boosted
exports
and
also
imports
from
the
rest
of
the
hemisphere
by
over
percent
and
that
supports
millions
of
jobs
in
all
of
our
countries
proposed
billion
to
help
the
people
of
central
america
strengthen
governance
and
improve
security
and
help
to
spark
more
economic
growth
and
most
importantly
provide
new
pathways
for
young
people
who
too
often
see
their
only
prospects
an
underground
economy
that
too
often
leads
to
violence
partnering
with
countries
across
the
region
to
develop
clean
more
affordable
and
reliable
energy
that
helps
nations
to
combat
the
urgent
threat
of
climate
change
as
president
already
noted
our
strong
in
the
initiative
is
working
to
bring
students
from
latin
america
to
the
united
states
and
students
from
the
united
states
to
latin
america
the
new
initiatives
that
announced
in
jamaica
will
help
empower
new
generation
of
young
people
across
the
with
the
skills
and
job
training
that
they
need
to
compete
in
the
global
economy
during
the
course
of
my
meetings
with
as
well
as
my
meetings
with
as
well
as
the
discussions
that
had
with
many
of
you
bilaterally
there
have
been
additional
ideas
that
very
interested
in
finding
ways
in
which
we
can
expand
access
to
the
internet
and
broadband
how
we
can
structure
partnerships
to
rebuild
infrastructure
across
the
region
and
to
expand
our
commercial
ties
in
and
inclusive
way
because
am
firmly
of
the
belief
that
we
will
only
succeed
if
everybody
benefits
from
the
economic
growth
not
just
few
at
the
top
at
home
taken
executive
actions
to
fix
as
much
of
our
broken
immigration
system
as
can
which
includes
trying
to
help
people
come
out
of
the
shadows
so
that
they
can
live
and
work
in
country
that
they
call
home
and
that
includes
hundreds
of
thousands
of
young
people
we
call
dreamers
who
have
already
received
temporary
relief
and
remaining
committed
to
working
with
our
congress
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
so
the
bottom
line
is
this
the
united
states
is
focused
on
the
future
not
caught
up
in
ideology
at
least
not
interested
in
progress
and
interested
in
results
not
interested
in
theoretic
arguments
interested
in
actually
delivering
for
people
we
are
more
deeply
engaged
across
the
region
than
we
have
been
in
decades
and
those
of
you
have
interacted
with
me
know
that
if
you
bring
an
issue
to
my
attention
will
do
my
best
to
try
to
address
it
will
not
always
be
able
to
fix
it
right
away
but
will
do
my
best
believe
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
is
as
good
as
it
has
ever
been
here
today
to
work
with
you
to
build
on
this
progress
let
me
just
mention
few
areas
in
which
think
we
can
make
more
progress
first
we
will
continue
to
uphold
the
democratic
charter
which
states
that
peoples
of
the
have
right
to
believe
our
governments
together
have
an
obligation
to
uphold
the
universal
freedoms
and
rights
of
all
our
citizens
want
to
again
commend
president
and
panama
for
making
civil
society
groups
from
across
the
region
formal
partners
in
this
summit
for
the
first
time
believe
the
voices
of
our
citizens
must
be
heard
and
believe
going
forward
civil
society
should
be
permanent
part
of
these
summits
second
we
have
to
focus
on
economic
growth
that
can
fuel
progress
further
in
those
communities
that
have
not
been
reached
and
that
means
making
the
more
competitive
we
still
have
work
to
do
to
regulations
encourage
good
governance
and
transparency
that
attracts
investment
invest
in
infrastructure
address
some
of
the
challenges
that
we
have
with
respect
to
energy
the
cost
of
energy
in
many
communities
in
many
countries
particularly
in
central
american
and
the
are
so
high
that
it
presents
great
challenge
to
economic
development
and
we
think
that
we
can
help
particularly
around
clean
energy
issues
we
have
to
confront
the
injustice
of
economic
inequality
and
poverty
think
that
collectively
we
are
starting
to
identify
what
programs
work
and
which
programs
do
not
work
and
we
should
put
more
money
in
those
things
that
do
work
and
stop
doing
those
things
that
we
have
money
to
waste
because
of
too
many
young
people
out
there
with
enormous
needs
think
president
is
right
to
focus
particularly
on
education
and
skills
building
and
this
is
an
agenda
which
we
should
all
tackle
collectively
third
we
have
to
keep
investing
in
the
clean
energy
that
creates
jobs
and
combats
climate
change
the
united
states
is
today
leading
this
global
effort
along
with
many
of
you
and
should
point
out
that
america
carbon
pollution
is
near
its
lowest
level
in
almost
two
decades
across
the
think
we
have
the
opportunity
to
expand
our
clean
energy
partnerships
and
increase
our
investments
in
and
finally
we
have
to
stand
firm
for
the
security
of
our
citizens
we
must
continue
to
join
with
our
partners
across
the
region
especially
in
central
america
but
also
in
the
to
promote
an
approach
holistic
approach
that
applies
rule
of
law
respects
human
rights
but
also
tackles
the
that
devastate
so
many
communities
this
is
shared
responsibility
and
said
before
that
the
united
states
has
responsibility
to
reduce
the
demand
for
drugs
and
to
reduce
the
flow
of
weapons
south
even
as
we
partner
with
you
to
go
after
the
networks
that
can
cause
so
much
violence
so
new
relationship
with
cuba
more
trade
and
economic
partnerships
that
reduce
poverty
and
creates
opportunity
particularly
focusing
on
education
increased
exchanges
more
investment
in
our
young
people
clean
energy
that
combats
climate
change
security
cooperation
to
protect
our
citizens
and
our
communities
the
new
chapter
of
engagement
that
the
united
states
is
pursuing
across
the
want
to
make
one
last
comment
addressing
some
of
the
points
that
president
raised
and
sure
will
be
raised
by
few
others
during
this
discussion
always
enjoy
the
history
lessons
that
receive
when
here
student
of
history
so
tend
to
actually
be
familiar
with
many
of
these
episodes
that
have
been
mentioned
am
the
first
one
to
acknowledge
that
application
of
concern
around
human
rights
has
not
always
been
consistent
and
certainly
mindful
that
there
are
dark
chapters
in
our
own
history
in
which
we
have
not
observed
the
principles
and
ideals
upon
which
the
country
was
founded
just
few
weeks
ago
was
in
alabama
celebrating
the
anniversary
of
march
across
bridge
that
resulted
in
horrific
violence
and
the
reason
was
there
and
the
reason
it
was
celebration
is
because
it
was
triumph
of
human
spirit
in
which
ordinary
people
without
resort
to
violence
were
able
to
overcome
systematic
segregation
their
voices
were
heard
and
our
country
changed
america
never
makes
claim
about
being
perfect
we
do
make
claim
about
being
open
to
change
so
would
just
say
that
we
can
suppose
spend
lot
of
time
talking
about
past
grievances
and
suppose
that
possible
to
use
the
united
states
as
handy
excuse
every
so
often
for
political
problems
that
may
be
occurring
domestically
but
not
going
to
bring
progress
not
going
to
solve
the
problems
of
children
who
read
who
have
enough
to
eat
not
going
to
make
our
countries
more
productive
or
more
competitive
in
global
economy
so
just
want
to
make
very
clear
that
when
we
speak
out
on
something
like
human
rights
not
because
we
think
we
are
perfect
but
it
is
because
we
think
the
ideal
of
not
jailing
people
if
they
disagree
with
you
is
the
right
ideal
perhaps
president
has
more
confidence
than
do
in
distinguishing
between
bad
press
and
good
press
there
are
whole
bunch
of
press
that
think
is
bad
mainly
because
it
me
but
they
continue
to
speak
out
in
the
united
states
because
have
confidence
in
system
in
which
one
person
is
making
that
determination
think
that
if
we
believe
in
democracy
it
means
that
everybody
has
the
chance
to
speak
out
and
offer
their
opinions
and
stand
up
for
what
they
believe
is
right
and
express
their
conscience
and
pray
as
they
would
and
and
assemble
as
they
believe
is
appropriate
as
long
as
not
operating
violently
so
we
will
continue
to
speak
out
on
those
issues
not
because
interested
in
meddling
but
because
we
know
from
our
own
history
precisely
because
imperfect
that
we
believe
appropriate
for
us
to
stand
up
when
king
was
in
jail
people
outside
the
united
states
spoke
up
on
his
behalf
and
would
be
betraying
our
history
if
did
not
do
the
same
the
cold
war
has
been
over
for
long
time
and
not
interested
in
having
battles
that
frankly
started
before
was
born
what
am
interested
in
is
solving
problems
working
with
you
what
the
united
states
is
interested
in
doing
why
invested
so
much
in
our
bilateral
relationships
and
why
will
continue
to
invest
in
creating
the
kind
of
spirit
of
equal
partnership
and
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
upon
which
believe
progress
can
advance
thank
you
very
much
this
morning
want
to
express
our
grief
and
condolences
to
the
families
of
two
hostages
one
american
warren
and
an
italian
who
were
tragically
killed
in
operation
warren
and
were
aid
workers
in
pakistan
devoted
to
improving
the
lives
of
the
people
after
warren
was
abducted
by
in
directed
my
national
security
team
to
do
everything
possible
to
find
him
and
to
bring
him
home
safely
to
his
family
and
dedicated
professionals
across
our
government
worked
tirelessly
to
do
so
we
also
worked
closely
with
our
italian
allies
on
behalf
of
who
was
kidnapped
in
since
our
efforts
have
prevented
terrorist
attacks
and
saved
innocent
lives
both
here
in
america
and
around
the
world
and
that
determination
to
protect
innocent
life
only
makes
the
loss
of
these
two
men
especially
painful
for
all
of
us
based
on
information
and
intelligence
we
have
obtained
we
believe
that
operation
targeting
an
compound
in
the
border
region
killed
warren
and
this
past
january
yesterday
spoke
with
wife
and
prime
minister
of
italy
as
husband
and
as
father
can
not
begin
to
imagine
the
anguish
that
the
and
families
are
enduring
today
that
there
are
no
words
that
can
ever
equal
their
loss
know
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
ever
say
or
do
to
ease
their
heartache
and
today
simply
want
to
say
this
as
president
and
as
take
full
responsibility
for
all
our
operations
including
the
one
that
inadvertently
took
the
lives
of
warren
and
profoundly
regret
what
happened
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government
offer
our
deepest
apologies
to
the
families
as
soon
as
we
determined
the
cause
of
their
deaths
directed
that
the
existence
of
this
operation
be
declassified
and
disclosed
publicly
did
so
because
the
and
families
deserve
to
know
the
truth
and
did
so
because
even
as
certain
aspects
of
our
national
security
efforts
have
to
remain
secret
in
order
to
succeed
the
united
states
is
democracy
committed
to
openness
in
good
times
and
in
bad
our
initial
assessment
indicates
that
this
operation
was
fully
consistent
with
the
guidelines
under
which
we
conduct
efforts
in
the
region
which
has
been
our
focus
for
years
because
it
is
the
home
of
leadership
and
based
on
the
intelligence
that
we
had
obtained
at
the
time
including
hundreds
of
hours
of
surveillance
we
believed
that
this
was
an
compound
that
no
civilians
were
present
and
that
capturing
these
terrorists
was
not
possible
and
we
do
believe
that
the
operation
did
take
out
dangerous
members
of
what
we
did
not
know
tragically
is
that
was
hiding
the
presence
of
warren
and
in
this
same
compound
it
is
cruel
and
bitter
truth
that
in
the
fog
of
war
generally
and
our
fight
against
terrorists
specifically
mistakes
sometimes
deadly
mistakes
can
occur
but
one
of
the
things
that
sets
america
apart
from
many
other
nations
one
of
the
things
that
makes
us
exceptional
is
our
willingness
to
confront
squarely
our
imperfections
and
to
learn
from
our
mistakes
already
have
directed
full
review
of
what
happened
we
will
identify
the
lessons
that
can
be
learned
from
this
tragedy
and
any
changes
that
should
be
made
we
will
do
our
utmost
to
ensure
it
is
not
repeated
and
we
will
continue
to
do
everything
we
can
to
prevent
the
loss
of
innocent
lives
not
just
innocent
americans
but
all
innocent
lives
in
our
operations
today
we
join
their
families
and
friends
in
warren
and
two
who
came
from
different
countries
but
who
were
united
by
spirit
of
service
for
decades
warren
lived
the
ideals
of
our
country
serving
with
the
peace
corps
and
later
with
the
united
states
agency
for
international
development
he
devoted
his
life
to
people
across
africa
and
south
asia
he
was
loving
husband
father
and
grandfather
who
willingly
left
the
comforts
of
home
to
help
the
people
of
pakistan
at
the
time
of
his
abduction
he
was
contractor
focused
on
helping
families
escape
poverty
and
give
better
life
to
their
children
humanitarianism
also
took
him
around
the
world
to
the
central
african
republic
to
haiti
and
ultimately
pakistan
like
warren
he
fell
in
love
with
pakistan
and
its
people
and
believed
passionately
that
he
could
made
difference
in
their
lives
service
reflected
the
commitment
of
the
italian
people
our
great
allies
and
friends
to
the
security
and
dignity
of
people
around
the
world
and
today
is
reminder
of
the
bonds
of
friendship
between
our
countries
and
the
shared
values
that
bind
americans
and
italians
together
there
could
be
no
starker
contrast
between
these
two
selfless
men
and
their
captors
work
benefited
people
across
faiths
meanwhile
boasted
to
the
world
that
it
held
warren
citing
his
jewish
faith
held
both
men
for
years
even
as
health
deteriorated
they
deprived
these
men
of
precious
irreplaceable
years
with
family
who
missed
them
terribly
amid
grief
that
is
unimaginable
pray
that
these
two
families
will
find
some
small
measure
of
solace
in
knowing
that
warren
and
legacy
will
endure
their
service
will
be
remembered
by
the
men
women
and
children
whose
lives
they
touched
and
made
better
their
spirit
will
live
on
in
the
love
of
their
families
who
are
in
our
thoughts
and
prayers
today
especially
wife
their
daughters
and
and
their
families
and
the
shining
example
of
these
two
men
will
stand
as
light
to
people
the
world
over
who
see
suffering
and
answer
with
compassion
who
see
hatred
and
offer
their
love
who
see
war
and

the
night
when
washington
celebrates
itself
somebody
got
to
do
it
and
welcome
to
the
fourth
quarter
of
my
presidency
it
true
that
was
cheering
the
fact
is
feel
more
loose
and
relaxed
than
ever
those
shoulder
massages
they
like
magic
you
should
try
one
oh
you
have
am
determined
to
make
the
most
of
every
moment
have
left
after
the
elections
my
asked
me
president
do
you
have
bucket
list
and
said
well
have
something
that
rhymes
with
bucket
list
take
executive
action
on
immigration
bucket
new
climate
regulations
bucket
it
the
right
thing
to
do
and
my
new
attitude
is
paying
off
look
at
my
cuba
policy
the
brothers
are
here
tonight
welcome
to
america
what
it
the
from
texas
oh
hi
hi
anyway
being
president
is
never
easy
still
have
to
fix
broken
immigration
system
issue
veto
threats
negotiate
with
iran
all
while
finding
time
to
pray
five
times
day
which
is
strenuous
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
people
keep
pointing
out
how
the
presidency
has
aged
me
look
so
old
john
has
already
invited
to
speak
at
my
funeral
meanwhile
has
aged
day
ask
her
what
her
secret
is
she
just
says
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
it
aggravating
the
fact
is
though
at
this
point
my
legacy
is
finally
beginning
to
take
shape
the
economy
is
getting
better
nine
in
ten
americans
now
have
health
coverage
today
thanks
to
you
no
longer
have
to
worry
about
losing
your
insurance
if
you
lose
your
job
you
welcome
senate
democrats
now
look
it
is
true
have
not
managed
to
make
everybody
happy
six
years
into
my
presidency
some
people
still
say
arrogant
and
aloof
condescending
some
people
are
so
dumb
no
wonder
do
meet
with
them
and
that
not
all
people
say
about
me
few
weeks
ago
says
he
thinks
the
worst
president
of
his
lifetime
which
is
interesting
because
think
is
the
worst
president
of
my
lifetime
it
quite
coincidence
mean
everybody
has
got
something
to
say
these
days
mike
recently
said
people
should
join
our
military
until
true
conservative
is
elected
president
think
about
that
it
was
so
outrageous
wrote
us
letter
trying
to
explain
to
how
our
system
works
it
gets
worse
just
this
week
actually
predicted
that
would
bring
about
the
biblical
end
of
days
now
that
legacy
that
big
mean
lincoln
washington
they
did
do
that
but
just
have
to
put
this
stuff
aside
got
to
stay
focused
on
my
job
because
for
many
americans
this
is
still
time
of
deep
uncertainty
for
example
have
one
friend
just
few
weeks
ago
she
was
making
millions
of
dollars
year
and
she
now
living
out
of
van
in
meanwhile
back
here
in
our
nation
capital
we
always
dealing
with
new
challenges
happy
to
report
that
the
secret
service
thanks
to
some
excellent
reporting
by
white
house
correspondents
they
really
focusing
on
some
of
the
issues
that
have
come
up
and
they
finally
figured
out
way
to
keep
people
off
my
lawn
it
works
and
it
not
just
as
some
of
you
know
few
months
ago
drone
out
back
that
was
pretty
serious
but
do
worry
we
installed
new
security
system
you
know
what
let
me
set
the
record
straight
tease
sometimes
but
he
has
been
at
my
side
for
seven
years
now
love
that
man
he
not
just
great
vice
president
he
is
great
friend
we
gotten
so
close
in
some
places
in
indiana
they
serve
us
pizza
anymore
want
to
thank
our
host
for
the
evening
chicago
girl
the
incredibly
talented
strong
on
saturday
night
live
impersonates
anchor
which
is
surprising
because
usually
the
only
people
impersonating
journalists
on
are
journalists
on
is
here
with
some
of
the
stars
from
their
big
new
comedy
it
great
show
but
have
to
give
fair
warning
being
only
makes
you
popular
for
so
long
trust
me
there
shelf
life
to
that
thing
as
always
the
reporters
here
had
lot
to
cover
over
the
last
year
here
on
the
east
coast
one
big
story
was
the
brutal
winter
the
polar
vortex
caused
so
many
record
lows
they
renamed
it
but
of
course
let
face
it
there
is
one
issue
on
every
reporter
mind
and
that
is
already
we
seen
some
missteps
it
turns
out
bush
identified
himself
as
hispanic
back
in
which
you
know
what
look
understand
it
an
innocent
mistake
reminds
me
of
when
identified
myself
as
american
back
in
ted
said
that
denying
the
existence
of
climate
change
made
him
like
galileo
now
that
not
really
an
apt
comparison
galileo
believed
the
earth
revolves
around
the
sun
ted
believes
the
earth
revolves
around
ted
and
just
as
an
aside
want
to
point
out
when
guy
who
has
his
face
on
hope
poster
calls
you
you
know
you
got
problem
the
narcissism
index
is
creeping
up
little
too
high
meanwhile
rick
announced
that
he
would
not
attend
the
wedding
of
friend
or
loved
one
to
which
gays
and
lesbians
across
the
country
responded
that
not
going
to
be
problem
do
sweat
that
one
and
trump
is
here
still
anyway
it
amazing
how
time
flies
soon
the
first
presidential
contest
will
take
place
and
for
one
can
not
wait
to
see
who
the
brothers
pick
it
exciting
rand
paul
ted
bush
walker
who
will
finally
get
that
red
rose
the
winner
gets
war
chest
the
runner
up
gets
to
be
the
bachelor
on
the
next
season
of
the
bachelor
mean
seriously
billion
dollars
from
just
two
guys
is
it
just
me
or
does
that
feel
little
excessive
mean
it
almost
insulting
to
the
candidates
the
brothers
think
they
need
to
spend
billion
dollars
to
get
folks
to
like
one
of
these
people
it
got
to
hurt
their
feelings
little
bit
and
look
know
raised
lot
of
money
too
but
in
all
fairness
my
middle
name
is
what
their
excuse
the
trail
has
been
easy
for
my
fellow
democrats
either
as
we
all
know
private
got
her
in
trouble
frankly
thought
it
was
going
to
be
her
private
account
that
was
going
to
cause
her
bigger
problems
kicked
things
off
by
going
completely
at
not
to
be
outdone
martin
kicked
things
off
by
going
completely
at
martin
campaign
event
and
might
run
like
is
an
interesting
guy
apparently
some
folks
really
want
to
see
socialist
in
the
white
house
we
could
get
third
term
after
all
it
could
happen
anyway
as
always
want
to
close
on
more
serious
note
often
joke
about
tensions
between
me
and
the
press
but
honestly
what
they
say
does
bother
me
understand
we
got
an
adversarial
system
mellow
sort
of
guy
and
that
why
invited
luther
my
anger
translator
to
join
me
here
tonight
enter
luther
luther
hold
on
to
your
butts
president
in
our
world
traditions
like
the
white
house
correspondents
dinner
are
important
luther
mean
really
what
is
this
dinner
and
why
am
required
to
come
to
it
bush
do
you
really
want
to
do
this
president
because
despite
our
differences
we
count
on
the
press
to
shed
light
on
the
most
important
issues
of
the
day
luther
and
we
can
count
on
fox
news
to
terrify
old
white
people
with
some
nonsense
law
is
coming
to
run
for
the
damn
hills
it
ridiculous
president
we
always
see
eye
to
eye
luther
oh
and
thank
you
so
much
for
the
coverage
for
two
whole
weeks
we
were
one
step
away
from
the
walking
dead
and
then
you
all
got
up
and
just
moved
on
to
the
next
day
that
was
awesome
oh
and
by
the
way
just
if
you
have
noticed
you
do
have
president
but
still
deeply
appreciate
the
work
that
you
do
luther
remember
when
had
that
big
old
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
then
plugged
it
remember
that
which
was
that
one
was
that
or
was
it
because
remember
president
protecting
our
democracy
is
more
important
than
ever
for
example
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
donor
who
gave
ted
million
dollars
was
just
exercising
free
luther
yeah
that
the
kind
of
like
this
just
wasted
six
million
dollars
president
and
it
not
just
republicans
will
have
to
rage
raise
huge
sums
of
money
too
luther
oh
yes
she
going
to
get
that
money
she
going
to
get
all
the
money
is
coming
to
so
watch
out
president
the
focus
on
billionaire
donors
creates
real
problems
for
our
democracy
luther
and
that
why
we
running
for
third
term
president
no
we
not
luther
we
not
president
no
luther
who
the
hell
said
that
president
but
we
do
need
to
stay
focused
on
some
big
challenges
like
climate
change
luther
hey
listen
if
you
have
noticed
california
is
bone
dry
it
looks
like
trailer
for
the
new
mad
movie
up
in
there
think
that
cooper
came
here
because
he
wants
to
talk
to
chuck
he
needed
glass
of
water
come
on
president
the
science
is
clear
nine
of
the
ten
hottest
years
ever
came
in
the
last
decade
luther
now
not
scientist
but
do
know
how
to
count
to
president
rising
seas
more
violent
storms
luther
we
got
sweaty
people
on
the
train
stinking
it
up
it
just
nasty
president
mean
look
at
what
happening
right
now
every
serious
scientist
says
we
need
to
act
the
pentagon
says
it
national
security
risk
miami
floods
on
sunny
day
and
instead
of
doing
anything
about
it
we
got
elected
officials
throwing
snowballs
in
the
senate
luther
okay
president
okay
think
they
got
it
president
it
is
crazy
what
about
our
kids
what
kind
of
stupid
shortsighted
irresponsible
bull
luther
wow
hey
president
what
luther
all
due
respect
sir
you
do
need
an
anger
translator
you
need
so
out
of
here
man
trying
to
get
into
all
this
president
go
luther
he
crazy
president
luther
my
anger
translator
ladies
and
gentlemen
now
that
got
that
off
my
chest
investigative
journalism
explanatory
journalism
journalism
that
exposes
corruption
and
injustice
and
gives
voice
to
the
different
the
the
voiceless
that
power
it
privilege
it
as
important
to
america
trajectory
to
our
values
our
ideals
than
anything
that
we
could
do
in
elected
office
we
remember
journalists
we
lost
over
the
past
year
journalists
like
and
james
murdered
for
nothing
more
than
trying
to
shine
light
into
some
of
the
world
darkest
corners
we
remember
the
journalists
unjustly
imprisoned
around
the
world
including
our
own
for
nine
months
has
been
imprisoned
in
for
nothing
more
than
writing
about
the
hopes
and
the
fears
of
the
iranian
people
carrying
their
stories
to
the
readers
of
the
washington
post
in
an
effort
to
bridge
our
common
humanity
as
was
already
mentioned
brother
is
here
tonight
and
have
told
him
personally
we
will
not
rest
until
we
bring
him
home
to
his
family
safe
and
sound
these
journalists
and
so
many
others
view
their
work
as
more
than
just
profession
but
as
public
good
an
indispensable
pillar
of
our
society
so
want
to
give
toast
to
them
raise
glass
to
them
and
all
of
you
with
the
words
of
the
american
foreign
correspondent
it
is
not
the
fact
of
liberty
but
the
way
in
which
liberty
is
exercised
that
ultimately
determines
whether
liberty
itself
survives
thank
you
for
your
devotion
to
exercising
our
liberty
and
to
telling
our
american
story
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america

mark
another
round
of
applause
for
his
hospitality
and
thanks
to
everyone
at
for
hosting
us
today
here
in
you
know
the
white
house
is
cool
got
basketball
court
actually
it
tennis
court
that
we
repainted
some
lines
when
came
into
office
so
it
combination
court
there
is
putting
green
that
president
put
in
can
you
imagine
by
the
way
if
had
put
in
putting
green
things
have
changed
but
got
all
that
and
the
tee
box
from
pebble
beach
come
on
sure
some
of
my
staff
is
running
around
right
now
in
the
and
buildings
they
want
to
be
lab
rats
for
your
new
gear
but
it
is
wonderful
to
be
here
please
give
it
up
for
two
people
who
fight
every
single
day
for
workers
your
representatives
in
congress
they
do
great
job
earl
and
they
are
both
here
give
them
big
round
of
applause
and
there
are
two
people
who
could
make
it
here
today
but
doing
great
job
and
you
should
give
them
round
of
applause
as
well
and
that
senator
and
representative
so
it
is
great
to
be
at
the
world
headquarters
of
such
an
iconic
company
company
that
helps
athletes
succeed
from
the
individual
to
the
world
stage
and
as
heard
come
to
to
talk
little
bit
about
trade
which
initially
may
have
had
some
people
thinking
what
is
going
that
we
know
about
going
to
be
great
an
outstanding
young
man
going
to
be
terrific
and
from
hawaii
by
the
way
local
boy
but
this
is
important
and
want
to
tell
you
why
think
trade
deals
and
our
willingness
to
go
out
there
and
compete
on
the
global
stage
is
so
important
before
came
out
here
had
chance
to
meet
with
some
small
business
owners
from
across
whose
workers
make
everything
from
bikes
to
tea
to
stationery
to
wine
and
they
know
how
important
this
is
to
them
sometimes
when
we
talk
about
trade
we
think
of
or
we
think
of
or
we
think
of
we
think
about
these
big
multinational
companies
but
those
small
business
leaders
came
here
today
because
they
understood
that
these
markets
outside
the
united
states
will
help
them
grow
and
will
help
them
hire
more
folks
just
as
all
the
suppliers
to
or
or
or
any
of
these
other
companies
understand
this
is
going
to
be
critical
to
their
growth
and
their
ability
to
create
new
jobs
in
fact
why
is
not
here
because
in
washington
as
we
speak
this
effort
on
behalf
of
small
business
owners
and
workers
now
small
businesses
are
the
backbone
of
our
economy
eventually
like
they
grow
sometimes
into
really
really
big
companies
they
employ
millions
of
people
percent
of
exporters
are
small
businesses
the
ones
who
make
made
in
and
made
in
the
mean
something
and
they
represent
something
essential
about
this
country
the
notion
that
if
got
good
idea
and
willing
to
work
at
it
you
can
turn
that
idea
into
business
you
can
growth
that
business
and
eventually
who
knows
what
might
happen
you
can
give
other
people
chance
to
earn
living
even
as
you
do
well
promise
and
up
to
us
to
keep
that
promise
alive
now
that
promise
was
threatened
for
almost
everybody
just
about
seven
years
ago
when
the
economy
nearly
collapsed
and
millions
of
americans
lost
their
jobs
and
their
homes
and
their
life
savings
but
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
the
american
people
and
entrepreneurs
like
the
ones
who
are
here
today
and
some
pretty
good
policies
from
my
administration
in
different
place
today
we
in
different
place
today
this
morning
we
learned
that
our
economy
created
new
jobs
last
month
the
unemployment
rate
ticked
down
again
to
percent
which
is
the
lowest
been
in
almost
seven
years
million
new
jobs
over
the
past
months
nearly
the
fastest
pace
in
over
decade
and
all
told
over
the
past
months
in
row
businesses
have
created
million
new
jobs
should
add
by
the
way
months
ago
is
when
signed
the
affordable
care
act
so
obviously
it
done
too
bad
in
terms
of
employment
in
this
country
just
thought
mention
that
since
there
were
lot
of
predictions
of
doom
and
gloom
would
just
suggest
those
who
were
making
those
predictions
go
back
and
check
the
statistics
just
saying
so
small
businesses
deserve
lot
of
credit
for
that
in
fact
over
the
past
several
years
small
businesses
have
created
nearly
two
out
of
every
three
new
american
jobs
and
the
question
is
how
do
we
build
on
that
success
got
to
be
relentless
in
our
efforts
to
support
small
businesses
who
are
creating
jobs
and
helping
to
grow
the
economy
and
been
the
purpose
behind
many
of
the
policies
fought
for
as
president
cut
taxes
for
small
businesses
more
than
dozen
times
pushed
for
investments
in
infrastructure
and
faster
internet
why
made
health
care
more
accessible
affordable
portable
to
give
people
the
freedom
to
change
jobs
or
launch
that
startup
without
worrying
about
losing
their
health
insurance
and
passing
trade
agreements
is
part
of
that
agenda
if
those
trade
agreements
are
the
right
kinds
of
trade
agreements
if
they
make
sure
that
growing
our
businesses
and
helping
american
workers
by
selling
goods
made
in
america
across
the
rest
of
the
world
and
been
talking
lot
about
this
lately
because
view
smart
trade
agreements
as
vital
piece
of
economics
not
contradiction
to
economics
part
and
parcel
of
it
believe
that
our
country
does
best
when
everyone
gets
fair
shot
everyone
does
their
fair
share
everybody
plays
by
the
same
set
of
rules
and
that
means
making
sure
everybody
has
got
good
education
it
means
making
sure
that
women
are
getting
paid
the
same
as
men
for
doing
the
same
work
it
means
making
sure
that
folks
have
to
have
sick
leave
and
family
leave
and
that
they
can
balance
work
and
family
in
fair
way
it
means
working
to
increase
the
minimum
wage
all
across
this
country
because
folks
who
have
some
of
the
toughest
jobs
get
the
lowest
pay
all
part
of
economics
but
you
know
what
so
is
trade
we
strive
to
make
sure
our
own
economy
lives
up
to
high
standards
but
in
lot
of
parts
of
the
world
the
rules
are
unfair
the
playing
field
is
uneven
that
puts
american
businesses
and
american
workers
at
disadvantage
so
the
question
is
what
should
we
do
about
it
some
folks
think
we
should
just
withdraw
and
not
even
try
to
engage
in
trade
with
these
countries
disagree
we
have
to
make
sure
america
writes
the
rules
of
the
global
economy
and
we
should
do
it
today
while
our
economy
is
in
the
position
of
global
strength
because
if
we
write
the
rules
for
trade
around
the
world
guess
what
china
will
and
write
those
rules
in
way
that
gives
chinese
workers
and
chinese
businesses
the
upper
hand
and
locks
goods
out
the
choice
we
face
we
not
going
to
be
able
to
isolate
ourselves
from
world
markets
we
got
to
be
in
there
and
compete
and
the
question
is
are
we
going
to
make
sure
that
the
rules
are
fair
so
that
our
businesses
and
our
workers
are
on
level
playing
field
because
when
they
are
we
win
every
time
when
the
rules
are
fair
we
win
every
time
so
this
is
why
such
strong
supporter
of
new
trade
agreements
they
going
to
help
our
workers
compete
and
our
businesses
compete
this
is
not
left
issue
or
right
issue
or
business
or
issue
it
is
about
fairness
and
equity
and
access
and
like
other
issues
that
waged
slow
steady
fights
on
over
the
last
seven
years
this
is
also
question
of
the
past
versus
the
future
so
the
partnership
that
working
on
the
biggest
trade
deal
that
we
working
on
right
now
has
to
do
with
the
asia
pacific
region
and
it
reflects
our
values
in
ways
that
frankly
some
previous
trade
agreements
did
not
the
most
progressive
trade
deal
in
history
got
strong
enforceable
provisions
for
workers
preventing
things
like
child
got
strong
enforceable
provisions
on
the
environment
helping
us
to
do
things
that
been
done
before
to
prevent
wildlife
trafficking
or
deforestation
or
dealing
with
our
oceans
and
these
are
enforceable
in
the
agreement
and
operates
in
the
pacific
region
so
they
understand
the
competitive
pressures
they
under
has
factories
all
around
the
world
and
face
it
mark
think
does
mind
me
saying
it
that
some
of
these
countries
they
do
have
the
standards
for
wages
and
conditions
that
we
have
here
so
when
you
look
at
country
like
under
this
agreement
would
actually
for
the
first
time
have
to
raise
its
standards
it
would
have
to
set
minimum
wage
it
would
have
to
pass
safe
workplace
laws
to
protect
its
workers
it
would
even
have
to
protect
freedom
to
form
unions
for
the
very
first
time
that
would
make
difference
that
helps
to
level
the
playing
field
and
it
would
be
good
for
the
workers
in
even
as
it
helps
make
sure
that
not
undercutting
competition
here
in
the
united
states
so
progress
it
mean
that
suddenly
working
conditions
in
will
be
like
they
are
here
at
or
here
in
right
away
but
it
moves
us
in
the
right
direction
and
if
or
any
of
the
other
countries
in
this
trade
agreement
meet
these
requirements
face
meaningful
consequences
if
country
that
wants
in
to
this
agreement
you
have
to
meet
higher
standards
if
you
out
if
you
break
the
rules
there
are
actual
repercussions
and
good
for
american
businesses
and
american
workers
because
we
already
meet
higher
standards
than
most
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
that
helps
level
the
playing
field
and
this
deal
would
strengthen
our
hand
overseas
by
giving
us
the
tools
to
open
other
markets
to
our
goods
and
services
and
make
sure
they
play
by
the
fair
rules
we
help
write
the
truth
is
we
have
one
of
the
most
open
markets
in
the
world
folks
are
already
selling
stuff
here
we
got
to
be
able
to
sell
there
that
requires
us
to
enter
into
trade
agreements
to
open
up
their
markets
hear
wine
is
actually
pretty
good
somebody
told
me
that
the
in
is
right
got
some
winemakers
right
here
well
want
to
make
sure
wine
consumers
have
the
opportunity
to
partake
in
our
excellent
wine
we
got
some
beef
producers
and
ranchers
around
here
beef
is
really
expensive
in
japan
make
sure
they
try
some
steaks
good
stuff
and
one
of
the
best
things
that
can
happen
for
our
businesses
and
our
workers
opening
up
markets
that
have
previously
been
closed
particularly
markets
where
already
selling
stuff
here
lack
of
reciprocity
not
fair
deal
right
now
we
want
to
make
it
fair
now
want
to
acknowledge
because
this
looks
like
very
and
informed
crowd
that
there
have
been
bunch
of
critics
about
trade
deals
generally
and
the
partnership
and
interesting
is
typically
my
friends
coming
from
my
party
and
my
fellow
on
minimum
wage
and
on
job
training
and
on
clean
energy
on
every
progressive
issue
right
there
with
me
and
then
on
this
one
like
whooping
on
me
but
tell
you
what
run
my
last
election
and
the
only
reason
do
something
is
because
think
good
for
american
workers
and
the
american
people
and
the
american
economy
have
any
other
rationale
for
doing
what
do
than
think
the
best
thing
for
the
american
people
and
on
this
issue
on
trade
actually
think
some
of
my
dearest
friends
are
wrong
just
wrong
and
why
first
of
all
they
say
that
this
trade
agreement
will
cost
american
jobs
and
really
basing
this
on
some
past
experience
looking
at
what
happened
in
the
over
the
last
years
as
there
was
lot
of
outsourcing
going
on
and
you
know
what
past
trade
agreements
true
always
reflect
our
values
or
always
do
enough
to
protect
american
workers
but
why
designing
different
kind
of
trade
deal
and
the
truth
is
that
companies
that
only
care
about
low
wages
already
moved
they
need
new
trade
deals
to
move
already
already
located
in
search
of
low
wages
what
this
trade
agreement
would
do
is
open
the
doors
to
the
jobs
of
the
future
jobs
that
we
excel
at
it
would
make
sure
our
manufacturers
who
are
operating
at
the
higher
end
of
the
value
chain
are
able
to
access
these
growing
markets
and
the
fact
is
over
the
past
few
years
our
manufacturers
have
been
steadily
creating
jobs
for
the
first
time
since
the
under
my
administration
after
more
than
decade
away
from
the
top
spot
business
leaders
around
the
world
have
declared
the
united
states
is
the
number
one
place
to
invest
for
third
year
in
row
third
year
in
row
so
the
point
is
outsourcing
is
already
giving
way
to
companies
are
starting
to
move
back
here
to
do
more
advanced
manufacturing
and
this
is
trend
we
expect
to
continue
this
trade
deal
would
help
that
just
this
morning
as
mark
may
have
mentioned
announced
that
with
the
partnership
it
will
make
new
investments
in
advanced
manufacturing
not
overseas
but
right
here
in
the
united
states
and
far
more
products
would
be
made
in
the
and
that
means
thousands
of
new
jobs
in
manufacturing
and
engineering
and
design
at
facilities
across
the
country
and
potentially
tens
of
thousands
of
new
jobs
along
supply
chain
here
at
home
what
trade
can
do
look
spent
six
and
half
years
trying
to
rescue
this
economy
six
and
half
years
of
trying
to
american
manufacturing
including
rescuing
an
american
auto
industry
that
was
on
its
back
and
is
now
fully
recovered
so
would
not
risk
any
of
that
if
thought
the
trade
deals
were
going
to
undermine
it
the
reason
for
this
is
because
think
it
will
enhance
it
and
advance
it
so
point
number
one
point
number
two
when
you
ask
folks
specifically
what
do
you
oppose
about
this
trade
deal
they
just
say
was
passed
years
ago
that
was
different
agreement
and
in
fact
this
agreement
fixes
some
of
what
was
wrong
with
by
making
and
environmental
provisions
actually
enforceable
was
just
getting
out
of
law
school
when
got
passed
number
three
got
some
critics
saying
that
any
deal
would
be
rushed
through
secret
deal
people
know
in
it
this
is
not
true
any
agreement
that
we
with
the
other
countries
will
have
to
be
posted
for
at
least
days
before
even
sign
it
then
it
would
go
to
congress
and
you
know
not
going
to
do
anything
fast
so
there
will
be
months
of
review
every
crossed
every
dotted
everybody
is
going
to
be
able
to
see
exactly
in
it
nothing
about
this
this
is
very
deliberate
track
which
will
be
fully
subject
to
scrutiny
and
confident
when
people
read
the
agreement
for
themselves
see
that
this
is
the
most
progressive
trade
deal
in
history
number
four
critics
warn
that
parts
of
this
deal
would
undermine
american
regulation
food
safety
worker
safety
even
financial
regulations
making
this
stuff
up
this
is
just
not
true
no
trade
agreement
is
going
to
force
us
to
change
our
laws
this
agreement
would
make
sure
our
companies
discriminated
against
in
other
countries
we
already
treat
companies
from
other
countries
fairly
here
but
our
companies
always
get
treated
fairly
there
so
sometimes
they
need
to
have
some
way
to
settle
disputes
where
not
subject
to
the
whims
of
some
government
bureaucrat
in
that
country
important
we
want
our
businesses
to
succeed
in
selling
over
there
because
that
how
our
workers
will
get
more
jobs
here
in
the
united
states
and
then
finally
some
critics
talk
about
currency
manipulation
now
this
has
been
problem
in
the
past
some
countries
they
try
to
lower
their
currency
so
that
it
makes
their
goods
cheaper
makes
our
more
expensive
there
was
time
when
china
was
pretty
egregious
about
this
when
came
into
office
started
pounding
on
them
every
time
meet
with
them
be
talking
about
currency
and
we
pushed
back
hard
and
china
moved
in
real
terms
their
currency
has
appreciated
about
percent
since
came
into
office
and
we
going
to
keep
on
going
after
it
but
not
an
argument
against
this
trade
agreement
if
we
give
up
the
chance
to
help
our
businesses
sell
their
stuff
in
the
markets
that
does
do
anything
to
stop
currency
manipulation
so
the
fact
is
some
folks
are
just
opposed
to
trade
deals
out
of
principle
reflexive
principle
and
what
tell
them
is
you
know
what
if
you
opposed
to
these
smart
progressive
trade
deals
then
that
means
you
must
be
satisfied
with
the
status
and
the
status
been
working
for
our
workers
it
been
working
for
our
businesses
and
there
are
people
here
who
will
tell
you
why
going
to
just
give
you
couple
of
examples
of
small
businesses
who
had
chance
to
meet
with
today
egg
press
is
greeting
card
company
really
nice
they
sell
their
cards
in
which
is
member
of
this
partnership
agreement
their
raise
your
hand
saw
her
there
she
is
so
says
that
if
they
could
more
easily
reach
customers
in
japan
as
well
sell
half
the
volume
that
they
do
here
in
america
lot
right
now
the
logistics
of
exporting
to
japan
are
too
complicated
products
end
up
being
held
up
for
months
at
the
border
this
agreement
would
help
solve
some
of
those
problems
so
can
sell
more
greeting
cards
in
japan
presumably
in
is
there
going
to
be
there
will
be
translation
process
assume
yes
absolutely
teasing
so
the
trade
deal
would
help
eliminate
barriers
and
simplify
customs
and
hold
countries
accountable
for
getting
products
delivered
swiftly
the
more
sells
the
more
she
can
grow
the
more
she
can
hire
here
in
here
in
the
united
states
fruit
products
makes
canned
fruits
berries
other
products
depends
on
exports
for
percent
of
its
annual
sales
right
now
it
exports
to
four
members
of
this
partnership
that
we
putting
together
japan
and
canada
unfortunately
selling
in
these
countries
right
now
can
mean
dealing
with
unfair
rules
designed
to
prevent
our
products
from
being
offered
in
their
markets
under
this
agreement
that
would
change
exporting
becomes
simpler
more
consistent
that
means
more
people
around
the
world
eating
berries
all
year
long
berry
tasty
winery
we
got
lot
of
drinkers
here
winery
in
one
of
its
top
export
markets
is
japan
right
now
there
are
high
tariffs
on
american
wine
in
that
country
under
this
trade
partnership
those
tariffs
would
be
eliminated
and
across
america
could
see
their
sales
grow
overseas
the
brother
team
that
runs
this
vineyard
wave
guys
they
say
we
can
make
it
easier
to
do
business
with
countries
that
are
already
our
trading
partners
countries
that
are
allies
good
right
this
deal
would
be
good
thing
so
do
it
took
while
for
you
to
catch
that
it
thought
that
was
pretty
obvious
so
listen
know
lot
of
folks
who
are
about
trade
past
trade
deals
always
live
up
to
the
hype
and
environmental
protections
always
strong
enough
saw
for
years
in
chicago
and
towns
across
illinois
manufacturing
collapsing
jobs
drying
up
outsourcing
is
real
folks
just
make
that
up
some
of
our
manufacturing
base
shifted
over
the
last
years
and
it
good
for
manufacturing
and
it
good
for
those
communities
and
it
good
for
workers
the
truth
it
had
benefits
other
jobs
were
created
we
got
cheaper
goods
but
there
was
real
displacement
and
real
pain
and
so
for
many
americans
this
is
not
an
abstraction
this
is
real
but
got
to
learn
the
right
lessons
from
that
the
lesson
is
not
that
we
pull
up
the
drawbridge
and
build
moat
around
ourselves
the
lesson
is
is
that
got
to
make
sure
that
the
trade
deals
that
we
do
shape
are
ones
that
allow
us
to
compete
fairly
so
when
took
office
decided
we
could
rethink
the
way
we
do
trade
in
way
that
actually
works
for
working
americans
think
this
was
the
right
thing
to
do
just
for
companies
if
think
this
was
the
right
thing
to
do
for
working
families
would
not
be
fighting
for
it
if
any
agreement
undercuts
working
families
sign
it
ran
for
office
to
expand
opportunity
for
everybody
the
idea
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
or
how
you
started
out
or
who
you
love
in
america
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
so
yes
we
should
be
mindful
of
the
past
but
we
ignore
the
realities
of
the
new
economy
we
stand
on
the
beaches
and
stop
the
global
economy
at
our
shores
got
to
harness
it
on
our
terms
this
century
is
built
for
us
about
innovation
about
dynamism
and
flexibility
and
entrepreneurship
and
information
and
knowledge
and
science
and
research
us
so
we
be
afraid
of
it
got
to
seize
it
got
to
give
every
single

good
morning
everybody
audience
good
morning
president
slightly
early
want
to
thank
rabbi
for
the
very
kind
introduction
and
to
all
the
members
of
the
congregation
thank
you
so
much
for
such
an
extraordinary
and
warm
welcome
want
to
thank
couple
of
outstanding
members
of
congress
who
are
here
senator
where
did
go
there
he
is
and
representative
sandy
who
is
here
want
to
thank
our
special
envoy
to
combat
for
his
important
work
there
he
is
but
as
said
most
of
all
want
to
thank
the
entire
congregation
of
israel
for
having
me
here
today
earlier
this
week
was
actually
interviewed
by
one
of
your
members
and
reminded
me
that
he
once
called
me
first
jewish
now
since
some
people
still
seem
to
be
wondering
about
my
faith
should
make
clear
this
was
an
honorary
title
but
was
flattered
and
as
an
honorary
member
of
the
tribe
not
to
mention
somebody
hosted
seven
white
house
and
been
advised
by
and
been
advised
by
two
jewish
chiefs
of
staff
can
also
proudly
say
that
getting
little
bit
of
the
hang
of
the
but
will
not
use
any
of
the
that
taught
me
because
want
to
be
invited
back
just
say
he
had
some
creative
new
synonyms
for
now
wanted
to
come
here
to
celebrate
jewish
american
heritage
month
because
this
congregation
like
so
many
around
the
country
helps
us
to
tell
the
american
story
and
back
in
when
president
grant
helped
dedicate
israel
he
became
the
first
sitting
president
in
history
to
attend
synagogue
service
and
at
the
time
it
was
an
extraordinarily
symbolic
gesture
not
just
for
america
but
for
the
world
and
think
about
the
landscape
of
jewish
history
tomorrow
night
the
holiday
of
marks
the
moment
that
moses
received
the
torah
at
mount
sinai
the
first
link
in
chain
of
tradition
that
stretches
back
thousands
of
years
and
foundation
stone
for
our
yet
for
most
of
those
years
jews
were
persecuted
not
embraced
by
those
in
power
many
of
your
ancestors
came
here
fleeing
that
persecution
the
united
states
could
have
been
merely
another
destination
in
that
ongoing
diaspora
but
those
who
came
here
found
that
america
was
more
than
just
country
america
was
an
idea
america
stood
for
something
as
george
washington
wrote
to
the
jews
of
island
the
united
states
to
bigotry
no
sanction
to
persecution
no
important
for
us
to
acknowledge
that
too
often
in
our
history
we
fell
short
of
those
lofty
ideals
in
the
legal
subjugation
of
african
americans
through
slavery
and
crow
the
treatment
of
native
americans
and
far
too
often
american
jews
faced
the
scourge
of
here
at
home
but
our
founding
documents
gave
us
north
star
our
bill
of
rights
our
system
of
government
gave
us
capacity
for
change
and
where
other
nations
actively
and
legally
might
persecute
or
discriminate
against
those
of
different
faiths
this
nation
was
called
upon
to
see
all
of
us
as
equal
before
the
eyes
of
the
law
when
other
countries
treated
their
own
citizens
as
refuse
we
lifted
up
our
lamp
beside
the
golden
door
and
welcomed
them
in
our
country
is
immeasurably
stronger
because
we
did
from
einstein
to
from
to
american
jews
have
made
contributions
to
this
country
that
have
shaped
it
in
every
aspect
and
as
community
american
jews
have
helped
make
our
union
more
perfect
the
story
of
exodus
inspired
oppressed
people
around
the
world
in
their
own
struggles
for
civil
rights
from
the
founding
members
of
the
to
freedom
summer
in
from
rights
to
gay
rights
to
workers
rights
jews
took
the
heart
of
biblical
edict
that
we
must
not
oppress
stranger
having
been
strangers
once
ourselves
earlier
this
year
when
we
marked
the
anniversary
of
the
march
in
we
remembered
the
iconic
images
of
rabbi
abraham
joshua
marching
with
king
praying
with
his
feet
to
some
it
must
have
seemed
strange
that
rabbi
from
warsaw
would
take
such
great
risks
to
stand
with
baptist
preacher
from
atlanta
but
explained
that
their
cause
was
one
and
the
same
in
his
essay
religion
is
an
island
he
wrote
must
choose
between
and
between
shared
hope
that
says
together
we
can
shape
brighter
future
or
shared
cynicism
that
says
our
world
is
simply
beyond
repair
so
the
heritage
we
celebrate
this
month
is
testament
to
the
power
of
hope
me
standing
here
before
you
all
of
you
in
this
incredible
congregation
is
testament
to
the
power
of
hope
rebuke
to
cynicism
rebuke
to
nihilism
and
it
inspires
us
to
have
faith
that
our
future
like
our
past
will
be
shaped
by
the
values
that
we
share
at
home
those
values
compel
us
to
work
to
keep
alive
the
american
dream
of
opportunity
for
all
it
means
that
we
care
about
issues
that
affect
all
children
not
just
our
own
that
prepared
to
invest
in
early
childhood
education
that
we
are
concerned
about
making
college
affordable
that
we
want
to
create
communities
where
if
willing
to
work
hard
you
can
get
ahead
the
way
so
many
who
fled
and
arrived
on
these
shores
were
able
to
get
ahead
around
the
world
those
values
compel
us
to
redouble
our
efforts
to
protect
our
planet
and
to
protect
the
human
rights
of
all
who
share
this
planet
particularly
important
to
remember
now
given
the
tumult
that
is
taking
place
in
so
many
corners
of
the
globe
in
one
of
the
most
dangerous
those
shared
values
compel
us
to
reaffirm
that
our
enduring
friendship
with
the
people
of
israel
and
our
unbreakable
bonds
with
the
state
of
israel
that
those
bonds
that
friendship
can
not
be
broken
those
values
compel
us
to
say
that
our
commitment
to
security
and
my
commitment
to
security
is
and
always
will
be
unshakeable
and
said
this
before
it
would
be
moral
failing
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
the
american
people
it
would
be
moral
failing
on
my
part
if
we
did
not
stand
up
firmly
steadfastly
not
just
on
behalf
of
right
to
exist
but
its
right
to
thrive
and
prosper
because
it
would
ignore
the
history
that
brought
the
state
of
israel
about
it
would
ignore
the
struggle
taken
place
through
millennia
to
try
to
affirm
the
kinds
of
values
that
say
everybody
has
place
everybody
has
rights
everybody
is
child
of
god
as
many
of
you
know
visited
the
houses
hit
by
rocket
fire
in
been
to
and
made
that
solemn
vow
forget
never
when
someone
threatens
citizens
or
its
very
right
to
exist
israelis
necessarily
that
seriously
and
so
do
today
the
military
and
intelligence
cooperation
between
our
two
countries
is
stronger
than
ever
our
support
of
the
iron
rocket
system
has
saved
israeli
lives
and
can
say
that
no
president
no
administration
has
done
more
to
ensure
that
israel
can
protect
itself
than
this
one
as
part
of
that
commitment
something
else
that
the
united
states
and
israel
agrees
on
iran
must
not
under
any
circumstances
be
allowed
to
get
nuclear
weapon
now
debate
about
how
to
achieve
that
and
that
healthy
debate
not
going
to
use
my
remaining
time
to
go
too
deep
into
policy
although
for
those
of
you
who
are
interested
we
have
lot
of
material
out
there
but
do
want
everybody
to
just
remember
few
key
things
the
deal
that
we
already
reached
with
iran
has
already
halted
or
rolled
back
parts
of
nuclear
program
now
seeking
comprehensive
solution
will
not
accept
bad
deal
as
pointed
out
in
my
most
recent
article
with
this
deal
will
have
my
name
on
it
so
nobody
has
bigger
personal
stake
in
making
sure
that
it
delivers
on
its
promise
want
good
deal
interested
in
deal
that
blocks
every
single
one
of
pathways
to
nuclear
weapon
every
single
path
deal
that
imposes
unprecedented
inspections
on
all
elements
of
nuclear
program
so
that
they
cheat
and
if
they
try
to
cheat
we
will
immediately
know
about
it
and
sanctions
snap
back
on
deal
that
endures
beyond
decade
that
addresses
this
challenge
for
the
long
term
in
other
words
deal
that
makes
the
world
and
the
region
including
israel
more
secure
how
define
good
deal
stand
here
today
and
guarantee
an
agreement
will
be
reached
hopeful
working
hard
but
nothing
is
agreed
until
everything
is
agreed
and
made
clear
that
when
it
comes
to
preventing
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
all
options
are
and
will
remain
on
the
table
moreover
even
if
we
do
get
good
deal
there
remains
the
broader
issue
of
support
for
terrorism
and
regional
and
ugly
threats
against
israel
and
why
our
strategic
partnership
with
israel
will
remain
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
days
and
years
ahead
and
why
the
people
of
israel
must
always
know
america
has
its
back
and
america
will
always
have
its
back
now
that
does
not
mean
that
there
will
not
be
or
should
not
be
periodic
disagreements
between
our
two
governments
there
will
be
disagreements
on
tactics
when
it
comes
to
how
to
prevent
iran
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
and
that
is
entirely
appropriate
and
should
be
fully
aired
because
the
stakes
are
sufficiently
high
that
anything
that
proposed
has
to
be
subjected
to
scrutiny
and
welcome
that
scrutiny
but
there
are
also
going
to
be
some
disagreements
rooted
in
shared
history
that
go
beyond
tactics
that
are
rooted
in
how
we
might
remain
true
to
our
shared
values
came
to
know
israel
as
young
man
through
these
incredible
images
of
and
and
and
israel
overcoming
incredible
odds
in
the
war
the
notion
of
pioneers
who
set
out
not
only
to
safeguard
nation
but
to
remake
the
world
not
only
to
make
the
desert
bloom
but
to
allow
their
values
to
flourish
to
ensure
that
the
best
of
judaism
would
thrive
and
those
values
in
many
ways
came
to
be
my
own
values
they
believed
the
story
of
their
people
gave
them
unique
perspective
among
the
nations
of
the
world
unique
moral
authority
and
responsibility
that
comes
from
having
once
been
stranger
yourself
and
to
young
man
like
me
grappling
with
his
own
identity
the
scars
of
race
here
in
this
nation
inspired
by
the
civil
rights
struggle
the
idea
that
you
could
be
grounded
in
your
history
as
israel
was
but
not
be
trapped
by
it
to
be
able
to
repair
the
world
that
idea
was
liberating
the
example
of
israel
and
its
values
was
inspiring
so
when
hear
some
people
say
that
disagreements
over
policy
belie
general
lack
of
support
of
israel
must
object
and
object
forcefully
for
us
to
paper
over
difficult
questions
particularly
about
the
conflict
or
about
settlement
policy
not
true
measure
of
friendship
before
came
out
here
the
rabbi
showed
me
the
room
been
built
to
promote
scholarship
and
dialogue
and
to
be
able
to
find
how
we
make
our
shared
values
live
and
the
reason
you
have
that
room
is
because
applying
those
values
to
our
lives
is
often
hard
and
it
involves
difficult
choices
why
we
study
why
not
just
formula
and
what
we
have
to
do
as
nations
as
well
as
individuals
we
have
to
grapple
and
struggle
with
how
do
we
apply
the
values
that
we
care
about
to
this
very
challenging
and
dangerous
world
and
it
is
precisely
because
care
so
deeply
about
the
state
of
israel
precisely
because
yes
have
high
expectations
for
israel
the
same
way
have
high
expectations
for
the
united
states
of
america
that
feel
responsibility
to
speak
out
honestly
about
what
think
will
lead
to
security
and
to
the
preservation
of
true
democracy
in
the
jewish
homeland
and
believe
two
states
for
two
peoples
israel
and
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
just
as
israelis
built
state
in
their
homeland
have
right
to
be
free
people
on
their
land
as
well
now
want
to
not
easy
the
are
not
the
easiest
of
partners
the
is
dangerous
and
we
can
not
expect
israel
to
take
existential
risks
with
their
security
so
that
any
deal
that
takes
place
has
to
take
into
account
the
genuine
dangers
of
terrorism
and
hostility
but
it
is
worthwhile
for
us
to
keep
up
the
prospect
the
possibility
of
bridging
divides
and
being
just
and
looking
squarely
at
possible
but
also
necessary
in
order
for
israel
to
be
the
type
of
nation
that
it
was
intended
to
be
in
its
earliest
founding
and
that
same
sense
of
shared
values
also
compel
me
to
speak
out
compel
all
of
us
to
speak
out
against
the
scourge
of
wherever
it
exists
want
to
be
clear
that
to
me
all
these
things
are
connected
the
rights
insist
upon
and
now
fight
for
for
all
people
here
in
the
united
states
compels
me
then
to
stand
up
for
israel
and
look
out
for
the
rights
of
the
jewish
people
and
the
rights
of
the
jewish
people
then
compel
me
to
think
about
child
in
that
feels
trapped
without
opportunity
what
jewish
values
teach
me
what
the
tradition
teaches
me
these
things
are
connected
and
in
recent
years
seen
deeply
disturbing
rise
in
in
parts
of
the
world
where
it
would
have
seemed
unthinkable
just
few
years
or
decades
ago
this
is
not
some
passing
fad
these
just
isolated
phenomenon
and
we
know
from
our
history
they
can
not
be
ignored
is
and
always
will
be
threat
to
broader
human
values
to
which
we
all
must
aspire
and
when
we
allow
to
take
root
then
our
souls
are
destroyed
and
it
will
spread
and
why
tonight
for
the
first
time
ever
congregations
around
the
world
are
celebrating
solidarity
chance
for
leaders
to
publicly
stand
against
and
bigotry
in
all
of
its
forms
and
proud
to
be
part
of
this
movement
and
proud
that
six
ambassadors
from
europe
are
joining
us
today
and
their
presence
here
our
presence
together
is
reminder
that
we
are
not
doomed
to
repeat
the
mistakes
of
the
past
our
traditions
our
history
can
help
us
chart
better
course
as
long
as
we
are
mindful
of
that
history
and
those
traditions
and
we
are
vigilant
in
speaking
out
and
standing
up
against
what
is
wrong
not
always
easy
think
to
speak
out
against
what
is
wrong
even
for
good
people
so
want
to
close
with
the
story
of
one
more
of
the
many
rabbis
who
came
to
years
ago
few
days
after
david
arrived
to
join
the
protests
he
and
colleague
were
thrown
in
jail
and
they
spent
friday
night
in
custody
singing
to
the
tune
of
shall
and
that
in
and
of
itself
is
profound
statement
of
faith
and
hope
but
wonderful
is
is
that
out
of
respect
many
of
their
fellow
protestors
began
wearing
what
they
called
as
they
marched
and
the
day
after
they
were
released
from
prison
rabbi
watched
king
lead
prayer
meeting
before
crossing
the
bridge
and
king
said
are
like
the
children
of
israel
marching
from
slavery
to
what
happens
when
true
to
our
values
not
just
good
for
us
but
it
brings
the
community
together
it
brings
the
community
together
and
it
helps
repair
the
world
it
bridges
differences
that
once
looked
unbridgeable
it
creates
future
for
our
children
that
once
seemed
unattainable
this
congregation
jewish
american
life
is
testimony
to
the
capacity
to
make
our
values
live
but
it
requires
courage
it
requires
strength
it
requires
that
we
speak
the
truth
not
just
when
easy
but
when
hard
so
may
we
always
remember
that
our
shared
heritage
makes
us
stronger
that
our
roots
are
intertwined
may
we
always
choose
faith
over
nihilism
and
courage
over
despair
and
hope
over
cynicism
and
fear
as
we
walk
our
own
leg
of
timeless
sacred
march
may
we
always
stand
together
here

just
say
again
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
welcome
to
the
united
states
of
america
we
are
thrilled
to
have
you
here
not
going
to
give
long
because
what
really
want
to
do
is
have
conversation
with
you
like
the
one
that
had
when
was
in
so
this
is
town
hall
meeting
the
less
speak
the
more
questions
you
get
to
ask
but
do
want
to
take
few
minutes
to
explain
why
believe
so
strongly
in
the
work
that
brings
us
together
today
and
why
your
presence
here
is
so
important
think
all
of
you
know
have
special
attachment
to
asia
as
boy
lived
in
jakarta
my
mother
spent
years
working
in
villages
to
help
women
improve
their
lives
so
asia
helped
shape
who
am
and
how
see
the
world
and
as
president
made
it
pillar
of
my
foreign
policy
to
make
sure
that
the
united
states
is
more
deeply
engaged
in
the
asia
pacific
region
including
asia
and
want
to
welcome
the
ambassadors
from
across
thank
you
for
being
here
and
for
your
partnership
give
them
big
round
of
so
deepened
ties
with
asia
because
your
region
is
critical
to
our
shared
future
there
are
more
than
million
people
who
live
in
the
countries
and
you
reflect
an
incredible
diversity
of
faiths
and
ethnic
groups
and
backgrounds
and
cultures
and
that
diversity
has
to
be
celebrated
and
it
has
to
be
protected
we
have
incredible
economic
engines
like
got
growing
economies
like
the
and
and
malaysia
and
we
can
see
growth
that
is
lifting
people
out
of
poverty
and
creating
more
jobs
and
trade
and
opportunity
for
all
our
countries
seen
historic
democratic
transition
in
got
elections
coming
later
this
year
in
communities
in
laos
and
brunei
are
working
for
development
sustainable
and
protecting
the
environment
and
seeing
new
commitments
to
the
education
of
young
women
and
girls
as
is
true
in
cambodia
the
people
of
played
critical
role
in
the
global
response
to
the
earthquake
in
nepal
and
we
are
mindful
of
the
king
of
health
issues
lately
and
we
wish
him
the
best
and
our
hopes
and
prayers
are
with
him
so
asia
is
stepping
up
on
the
move
and
today
relationship
with
the
region
is
stronger
than
ever
proud
to
be
the
first
american
president
to
meet
regularly
with
all
leaders
will
continue
to
do
so
until
am
no
longer
president
strengthened
our
alliances
including
with
the
forged
new
partnerships
with
and
malaysia
and
our
trade
with
has
been
growing
pursuing
the
partnership
working
with
to
bind
the
region
more
closely
together
and
confront
shared
challenges
and
uphold
international
rules
and
norms
including
freedom
of
navigation
and
to
ensure
that
disputes
are
resolved
peacefully
at
the
moment
several
of
our
nations
are
working
to
rescue
desperate
migrants
who
are
at
sea
which
reflects
our
commitment
to
the
security
and
dignity
and
human
rights
of
every
human
being
but
despite
all
the
work
been
doing
and
the
ambassadors
have
been
doing
building
these
stronger
ties
is
not
just
the
work
of
government
they
have
to
be
rooted
in
partnerships
between
our
peoples
and
especially
young
people
like
you
all
across
asia
almost
of
the
population
is
under
years
old
so
this
is
young
part
of
the
world
technology
is
giving
you
more
power
to
communicate
and
like
never
before
in
tens
of
millions
of
people
are
connected
on
across
the
region
you
are
civil
society
leaders
working
for
democracy
and
human
rights
and
religious
tolerance
you
are
entrepreneurs
who
are
turning
your
ideas
into
new
businesses
activists
fighting
for
the
environment
and
against
climate
change
and
the
power
that
young
people
have
and
the
spirit
of
optimism
and
idealism
that
you
represent
so
you
inspiring
to
me
and
made
it
clear
that
america
wants
to
be
your
partner
we
want
to
help
you
succeed
so
two
years
ago
we
launched
the
young
asian
leaders
initiative
to
help
empower
young
people
like
you
to
give
you
more
of
the
skills
and
resources
and
networks
that
you
need
to
turn
your
ideas
into
action
and
since
then
offered
workshops
networking
exchanges
professional
development
training
and
today
the
network
includes
nearly
young
people
like
you
last
year
in
at
the
town
hall
meeting
that
mar
mentioned
announced
our
fellowship
program
to
bring
young
leaders
from
across
the
region
to
the
united
states
to
help
develop
their
skills
and
for
this
first
class
of
more
than
people
applied
the
competition
was
intense
today
proud
to
welcome
you
as
the
first
class
of
fellows
very
proud
of
you
and
had
chance
to
read
about
some
of
you
and
the
amazing
things
that
been
doing

suspect
that
from
the
there
she
is
right
there
she
spoke
for
lot
of
you
she
said
dreaming
or
is
this
really
happening
so
really
happening
you
come
from
all
nations
from
capital
cities
and
rural
towns
you
represent
different
faiths
and
backgrounds
and
different
beliefs
obviously
there
are
men
and
women
here
in
fact
the
majority
are
women
because
one
of
the
best
measures
of
success
is
whether
it
empowers
women
and
girls
and
all
bound
together
by
common
belief
that
you
have
the
talent
and
the
drive
and
the
power
to
improve
the
lives
of
your
fellow
human
beings

here

please
stand
up
so
here
from
laos
in
atlanta
she
visited
the
memorial
and
the
reverend
martin
luther
king
and
she
was
struck
by
one
of
quotes
which
says
most
persistent
and
urgent
question
is
are
you
doing
for
others
and
that
prompted
her
to
think
about
the
true
meaning
of
leadership
and
she
wrote
something
very
beautiful
that
want
everybody
to
hear
is
inside
you
she
said
can
be
leader
because
everybody
can
serve
you
have
to
have
college
degree
to
lead
you
need
to
know
more
than
the
others
all
you
need
is
heart
full
of
grace
soul
generated
by
pretty
good
so
what
see
in
all
of
you
why
believe
so
strongly
that
going
to
keep
answering
that
question
king
asked
what
are
you
doing
for
others
why
confident
that
all
of
you
will
be
extraordinary
leaders
already
doing
great
work
in
your
communities
and
your
countries
with
hearts
full
of
grace
and
souls
generated
by
love
and
you
will
continue
to
have
friend
and
partner
in
the
united
states
of
america
so
we
are
very
very
proud
of
you
and
with
that
want
to
hear
from
you
both
questions
or
you
can
tell
me
story
about
the
exciting
food
that
had
all
across
the
country
so
we
have
some
microphones
in
the
audience
and
what
do
is
just
call
on
people
and
going
to
go
boy
girl
boy
girl
so
that
very
fair
so
start
with
this
young
lady
here
please
introduce
yourself
and
tell
us
where
from
question
hi
president
am
an
elected
representative
from
malaysia
my
question
to
you
is
what
is
your
view
on
the
democracy
in
malaysia
with
the
recent
jailing
of
the
opposition
leader
and
the
crackdown
on
opposition
thank
you
president
well
malaysia
has
history
of
democracy
that
has
to
be
preserved
and
have
very
good
relationship
with
prime
minister
and
we
are
close
partners
and
cooperating
on
whole
host
of
issues
think
that
malaysia
like
all
our
countries
not
just
countries
but
countries
here
in
the
united
states
have
to
that
democracy
is
not
just
elections
but
how
open
and
transparent
and
accountable
government
is
between
elections
and
important
that
free
freedom
of
the
press
an
independent
judiciary
the
right
to
assemble
peacefully
that
all
those
rights
are
observed
to
make
democracy
work
so
as
general
rule
comment
on
even
individual
cases
in
this
country
much
less
another
country
because
think
important
for
the
legal
system
to
work
but
do
know
that
it
is
important
if
an
opposition
leader
who
is
well
known
has
been
charged
with
crime
that
that
process
of
how
that
is
adjudicated
and
how
open
it
is
and
how
clear
the
evidence
is
that
that
is
all
subject
to
scrutiny
because
what
you
want
is
situation
in
which
the
legitimacy
of
the
process
is
questioned
that
has
an
adverse
impact
on
democracy
as
whole
and
think
we
all
have
to
guard
against
making
sure
that
not
chilling
effect
on
potential
opposition
in
government
so
as
always
point
out
democracy
is
hard
mean
think
that
many
of
the
things
that
are
said
about
me
are
terribly
unfair
but
the
reason
american
democracy
has
survived
for
so
long
is
because
people
even
if
wrong
have
right
to
say
what
they
think
george
washington
our
first
president
he
complained
terribly
about
some
of
the
foolishness
that
was
said
about
him
but
part
of
the
reason
he
is
considered
one
of
our
greatest
presidents
is
because
he
set
an
example
of
that
if
democracy
was
to
work
then
you
had
to
respect
the
rights
of
even
those
people
who
you
disagreed
most
with
because
otherwise
no
way
that
democracy
can
flourish
over
the
long
term
so
these
are
things
that
said
publicly
when
was
in
when
was
in
malaysia
rather
had
an
opportunity
to
meet
with
some
community
activists
and
civil
society
leaders
there
and
this
is
something
that
say
everywhere
we
go
and
important
for
america
to
that
not
perfect
either
and
so
we
have
to
make
sure
that
we
are
constantly
seeing
how
do
we
improve
our
democracy
mean
the
amounts
of
money
for
example
that
are
involved
in
our
elections
these
days
is
disturbing
because
it
makes
it
seem
as
if
few
people
have
more
influence
in
the
democracy
than
the
many
and
so
will
continue
to
speak
out
about
these
issues
even
with
friends
maybe
sometimes
we
are
even
more
willing
to
say
something
when
friends
because
we
know
that
they
can
do
better
thank
you
yes
sir
question
hello
president
am
from
am
working
with
the
ministry
of
finance
my
theme
is
economic
empowerment
my
question
is
what
is
your
expectation
about
economic
relationship
between
united
states
and
countries
in
the
future
thank
you
president
well
we
already
have
very
strong
economic
relationship
as
pointed
out
this
is
region
that
is
growing
fast
it
has
big
population
you
have
very
hardworking
people
entrepreneurial
people
expect
it
will
continue
to
grow
and
the
united
states
wants
to
be
partner
in
all
sorts
of
ways
trade
is
the
most
obvious
and
important
relationship
economically
and
so
one
of
the
reasons
why
think
the
partnership
is
so
important
is
because
it
sets
up
set
of
principles
to
ensure
fair
trade
between
countries
it
calls
for
higher
standards
for
all
countries
higher
environmental
standards
for
all
countries
it
makes
sure
that
countries
are
being
treated
companies
are
being
treated
fairly
when
they
are
operating
in
foreign
market
and
the
potential
think
if
we
get
this
right
and
completed
in
the
next
few
months
to
be
able
to
ensure
that
the
united
states
and
countries
that
already
have
massive
amount
of
trade
that
able
to
increase
and
that
more
opportunity
for
everybody
but
at
high
standard
rather
than
low
standard
part
of
the
goal
for
countries
most
of
them
are
now
entering
into
stage
of
development
where
they
want
to
just
be
sending
raw
materials
to
else
to
have
them
developed
they
want
to
be
creating
value
starting
their
own
businesses
making
sure
that
they
are
part
of
the
century
economy
and
that
requires
upgrading
skills
education
for
their
populations
we
think
we
can
be
helpful
in
those
areas
and
we
want
to
encourage
high
educational
levels
in
countries
because
then
less
likely
that
workers
are
exploited
and
that
means
then
that
competing
with
us
because
you
have
the
best
ideas
and
the
best
products
as
opposed
to
just
you
have
the
cheapest
and
if
all
that
countries
are
offering
are
cheap
then
what
happens
is
workers
get
hurt
and
you
necessarily
see
an
improvement
in
standards
of
living
for
those
countries
if
everybody
is
operating
at
higher
level
then
all
competing
on
an
even
playing
field
and
over
time
that
will
result
in
more
growth
and
more
development
in
countries
but
think
skills
training
is
the
most
important
thing
think
that
the
power
of
the
internet
to
access
markets
and
ideas
will
be
particularly
important
for
countries
infrastructure
is
something
that
still
needs
to
get
done
think
there
is
still
of
infrastructure
in
that
region
know
there
was
some
controversy
while
back
because
china
wanted
to
start
an
asia
infrastructure
bank
we
yet
signed
on
to
participate
want
to
be
very
clear
we
actually
want
china
to
invest
in
infrastructure
in
that
region
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
investments
are
actually
good
for
the
people
in
those
countries
which
means
transparency
in
terms
of
how
decisions
are
made
at
this
new
bank
but
continue
with
the
asian
development
bank
and
the
world
bank
and
other
institutions
and
try
to
encourage
not
only
investment
in
human
capital
but
also
the
infrastructure
needed
and
finally
think
sustainability
is
going
to
be
critical
worry
about
the
great
forests
of
and
malaysia
if
those
all
just
become
palm
oil
plantations
and
deforestation
continues
at
the
same
pace
it
has
then
the
prospects
of
additional
accelerated
climate
change
are
very
powerful
not
to
mention
the
loss
of
species
and
biodiversity
the
oceans
if
you
get
overfishing
problem
pollution
given
how
populated
these
areas
are
it
very
important
that
economic
development
ties
in
with
sustainable
development
otherwise
think
all
have
problems
okay
good
so
young
lady
right
here
question
president
question
president
city
council
member
of
city
the
there
are
handful
or
there
are
few
elected
officials
some
are
fellows
really
would
like
to
know
what
is
your
word
of
advice
for
young
budding
political
leader
young
legislator
elected
official
like
me
in
developing
democracy
like
the
thank
you
president
that
great
well
think
my
first
advice
is
do
be
shy
and
obviously
you
okay
think
you
doing
to
do
great
think
that
when
think
about
my
own
political
career
when
look
at
other
political
careers
that
admire
think
the
most
important
thing
is
to
have
sense
of
principle
and
why
you
in
public
service
think
sometimes
people
want
to
be
in
public
service
just
because
they
like
seeing
their
name
up
in
lights
they
like
being
important
and
that
bad
reason
to
go
into
politics
you
should
be
like
an
actress
or
singer
or
make
lot
of
money
but
if
you
going
into
politics
and
public
service
only
one
good
reason
to
do
it
and
that
is
because
you
want
to
help
people
and
you
should
know
what
it
is
that
you
stand
for
and
what
you
believe
in
it
does
mean
that
you
have
to
compromise
it
does
mean
that
you
might
not
change
your
mind
about
an
issue
as
you
go
forward
and
you
learn
more
and
you
have
more
experience
but
you
should
have
something
inside
of
you
that
says
these
are
the
things
that
are
really
important
to
me
that
will
not
compromise
on
all
right
so
for
me
throughout
my
political
career
even
before
was
in
politics
and
was
just
working
as
community
knew
that
wanted
to
work
to
create
more
opportunity
for
all
people
that
my
orientation
was
always
how
does
this
help
the
poor
or
the
or
somebody
who
has
less
opportunity
then
me
how
is
this
going
to
help
them
if
they
work
hard
to
get
ahead
know
that
one
of
the
important
principles
for
me
has
always
been
treating
everybody
fairly
so
whether
that
women
or
people
of
different
races
or
different
religious
faiths
or
different
sexual
orientations
that
one
of
my
core
principles
is
that
will
never
engage
in
politics
in
which
trying
to
divide
people
or
make
them
less
than
me
because
they
look
different
or
have
different
religion
that
core
principle
that
not
something
would
violate
right
so
if
you
have
clear
view
of
what
you
stand
for
then
as
you
move
forward
have
setbacks
there
will
be
times
where
you
did
succeed
there
will
be
times
where
you
frustrated
there
will
be
times
you
might
even
lose
an
election
sometimes
but
at
least
know
every
morning
when
you
wake
up
and
you
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
know
who
am
and
why
doing
what
doing
and
think
those
are
the
people
who
eventually
end
up
having
successful
careers
because
people
sense
that
integrity
and
that
leadership
even
if
they
do
agree
with
you
at
least
they
know
you
believe
in
something
and
unfortunately
too
many
politicians
they
just
climbing
the
ladder
but
they
do
know
why
and
when
they
get
there
then
they
not
very
effective
leaders
or
they
become
much
more
subject
to
the
temptations
of
corruption
because
all
they
worried
about
is
want
to
hang
on
to
my
power
and
willing
to
give
up
anything
in
you
have
to
be
willing
to
lose
something
for
your
principles
you
have
to
be
willing
to
lose
an
election
because
you
think
that
something
that
more
important
than
you
just
winning
an
election
and
if
you
do
that
now
but
you
have
to
you
should
try
to
win
not
saying
you
should
try
to
lose
but
you
have
to
stand
for
something
that
my
most
important
advice
gentleman
in
the
suit
right
there
yes
you
question
thank
you
come
from
like
many
others
look
forward
to
seeing
you
and
the
first
lady
visiting
my
country
in
the
near
future
have
question
president
what
do
you
expect
the
young
people
in
the
asian
countries
doing
in
dealing
with
the
current
challenges
to
the
peace
stability
respect
to
international
law
like
the
inaudible
while
promoting
the
cooperation
between
the
countries
with
others
including
especially
with
the
united
states
thank
you
president
especially
with
sorry
the
last
part
question
especially
with
the
united
states
president
oh
with
the
united
states
well
look
think
that
seen
already
significant
progress
with
countries
over
the
last
six
years
that
been
attending
the
meetings
and
the
east
asia
summit
and
think
initially
the
meetings
would
just
be
symbolic
and
there
would
be
lot
of
pleasantries
and
lot
of
meetings
and
cultural
events
but
we
always
have
an
agenda
and
think
one
of
the
things
that
started
to
see
is
people
working
much
more
concretely
on
what
are
we
trying
to
accomplish
here
how
do
we
develop
more
capacity
for
example
in
the
region
around
disaster
relief
so
that
if
heaven
forbid
another
typhoon
of
the
sort
that
we
saw
in
the
or
if
in
fact
that
we
see
some
other
natural
tragedy
that
all
the
countries
assets
can
be
brought
to
bear
and
done
the
training
ahead
of
time
to
know
who
can
help
and
how
they
can
help
think
the
trying
to
work
on
coming
up
with
standards
around
maritime
law
is
big
challenge
and
obviously
significant
tension
right
now
between
many
of
the
countries
and
china
as
well
as
the
united
states
with
china
around
the
south
china
sea
and
how
those
issues
are
going
to
be
resolved
has
been
very
constructive
in
trying
to
put
together
code
of
conduct
that
all
countries
should
abide
by
so
that
disputes
around
maritime
boundaries
are
resolved
through
law
and
an
impartial
process
rather
than
just
based
on
the
biggest
and
that
think
is
going
to
be
very
important
can
play
an
important
role
in
those
areas
environmental
issues
already
mentioned
this
is
very
region
and
it
is
important
to
make
sure
that
lot
of
cooperation
between
countries
because
small
fisheries
those
always
observe
national
boundaries
and
so
working
together
you
can
accomplish
more
and
then
human
rights
issues
and
democracy
issues
reinforcing
good
habits
among
the
countries
is
very
important
think
fair
to
say
that
the
elections
that
will
be
taking
place
in
would
not
have
happened
if
it
been
for
the
good
example
that
set
with
its
transition
and
other
countries
showing
the
path
from
military
rule
towards
democracy
and
how
through
all
the
lessons
that
have
been
learned
that
could
be
accomplished
and
that
think
created
more
space
within
to
and
president
to
feel
that
this
is
possible
so
part
of
the
goal
here
is
to
make
sure
that
each
country
is
reinforcing
the
best
habits
and
laws
and
observing
human
rights
and
being
critical
when
one
country
slips
but
in
constructive
way
that
allows
for
path
to
improvement
and
think
can
do
that
uniquely
and
the
united
states
will
be
partner
we
have
obviously
bilateral
relationships
with
each
of
these
countries
but
we
also
want
to
be
partner
with
the
group
as
whole
to
encourage
this
cooperative
model
going
forward
okay
young
lady
right
there
yes
question
good
afternoon
president
from
work
as
data
analyst
in
the
world
bank
country
office
my
theme
is
civic
engagement
my
question
to
you
now
that
your
second
term
in
the
office
is
about
to
end
how
do
you
want
the
world
to
remember
you
thank
you
president
fondly
hope
still
have
months
in
office
so
got
lot
of
work
still
to
do
before
can
start
thinking
about
looking
backwards
still
very
much
focused
on
in
front
of
me
but
obviously
there
are
things
that
been
proud
of
when
came
into
office
the
united
states
and
the
world
was
going
through
terrible
economic
crisis
the
worst
really
since
the
and
it
was
hard
but
we
ended
up
avoiding
terrible
depression
and
within
year
the
economy
was
growing
again
here
in
the
united
states
now
back
to
the
employment
levels
our
auto
industry
was
saved
but
also
internationally
we
averted
much
worse
crisis
because
of
in
part
the
leadership
the
united
states
showed
along
with
international
institutions
and
central
banks
managing
that
was
very
important
an
important
legacy
for
me
think
that
the
work
that
done
to
provide
health
insurance
for
people
here
in
the
united
states
and
to
provide
more
educational
opportunity
is
consistent
with
the
principles
that
talked
about
the
reason
got
into
politics
internationally
reinvigorated
diplomacy
in
whole
variety
of
ways
people
remember
when
came
into
office
the
united
states
in
world
opinion
ranked
below
china
and
just
barely
above
russia
and
today
once
again
the
united
states
is
the
most
respected
country
on
earth
and
part
of
that
think
is
because
of
the
work
that
we
did
to
the
world
and
say
that
we
want
to
work
with
you
as
partners
with
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
on
that
basis
that
we
were
able
to
end
two
wars
while
still
focusing
on
the
very
real
threat
of
terrorism
and
to
try
to
work
with
our
partners
on
the
ground
in
places
like
iraq
and
the
reason
why
we
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
relations
with
cuba
the
nuclear
deal
that
trying
to
negotiate
with
iran
our
efforts
to
help
encourage
democracy
in
think
the
people
of
deserve
the
credit
for
this
new
opening
but
my
visit
there
hurt
in
trying
to
reinforce
the
possibilities
of
freedom
for
million
people
and
so
that
direct
engagement
the
work
that
done
to
build
and
strengthen
international
including
on
issues
like
public
health
and
the
fight
against
is
just
the
most
recent
example
of
that
think
been
able
to
put
our
international
relationships
on
very
strong
footing
that
allows
us
then
to
work
more
cooperatively
with
other
countries
moving
forward
to
meet
the
important
challenges
ahead
but
still
got
lot
of
work
to
do
so
maybe
in
months
check
back
with
you
and
let
you
know
all
right
gentleman
right
here
with
the
sash
question
hello
president
from
burma
and
firstly
would
like
to
say
hello
on
behalf
of
my
family
and
my
question
is
work
in
tourism
business
in
burma
and
my
question
is
that
what
do
you
see
critical
areas
in
where
the
can
contribute
economic
development
in
burma
thank
you
so
much
president
well
burma
it
lost
lot
of
time
over
the
last
years
because
of
the
very
tight
controls
on
the
economy
and
the
discouragement
of
entrepreneurship
and
new
businesses
part
of
the
reason
why
was
so
struck
when
to
was
it
reminded
me
of
when
first
arrived
in
back
in
whereas
when
go
to
jakarta
now
or
or
bangkok
it
looks
completely
different
this
looked
like
the
past
so
lot
of
catching
up
to
do
the
good
news
is
though
countries
that
are
still
at
those
early
stages
of
development
they
can
grow
very
fast
because
so
much
energy
and
opportunity
and
think
the
most
important
thing
is
going
to
be
establishing
rule
of
law
and
systems
and
practices
where
if
you
start
business
you
can
feel
confident
that
you
have
to
pay
bribes
and
you
have
to
hire
son
and
that
you
can
make
profit
that
if
foreign
investor
that
they
can
invest
and
be
treated
fairly
and
that
their
rights
and
their
intellectual
property
and
their
property
are
protected
those
basic
systems
of
law
where
those
are
established
those
countries
can
do
well
because
the
natural
talents
of
the
people
and
the
incredible
resources
and
hard
work
of
the
people
then
pay
off
mean
look
at
is
tiny
little
place
it
has
really
nothing
no
resources
to
speak
of
but
today
when
you
travel
to
it
is
as
prosperous
as
any
place
in
the
world
why
is
that
well
part
of
it
is
that
set
up
set
of
systems
where
if
businesses
were
started
or
investors
came
in
they
knew
that
they
could
find
very
skilled
workforce
they
knew
that
the
rules
were
rules
in
terms
of
operations
so
it
will
take
some
time
for
think
to
move
in
that
direction
but
you
have
your
own
models
even
in
among
the
countries
you
have
to
look
to
the
united
states
you
can
look
at
just
your
some
of
your
to
see
what
is
required
for
success
and
what
the
united
states
will
try
to
do
is
to
provide
technical
assistance
and
we
will
also
try
to
provide
direct
assistance
particularly
around
building
skills
and
education
because
one
of
the
keys
is
to
make
sure
that
you
have
workforce
that
can
add
value
in
the
age
of
the
internet
when
companies
can
locate
anywhere
the
most
important
thing
is
to
find
where
there
is
security
so
no
conflict
where
rule
of
law
and
the
people
are
highly
skilled
and
if
you
have
those
three
things
then
people
will
invest
yes
go
ahead
question
good
afternoon
president
from
and
now
work
on
the
issue
in
and
country
so
today
would
like
to
ask
you
if
you
were
which
country
would
you
prefer
to
live
with
and
why
thank
you
so
much
president
an
interesting
question
let
me
speak
more
broadly
and
then
answer
your
question
we
were
talking
earlier
about
required
for
to
succeed
think
one
of
the
most
important
things
is
to
put
an
end
to
discrimination
against
people
because
of
what
they
look
like
or
what
their
faith
is
and
the
have
been
discriminated
against
significantly
and
part
of
the
reason
fleeing
think
if
were
would
want
to
stay
where
was
born
want
to
stay
in
the
land
where
my
parents
had
lived
but
want
to
make
sure
that
my
government
was
protecting
me
and
that
people
were
treating
me
fairly
what
want
and
why
so
important
think
as
part
of
the
democratic
transition
to
take
very
seriously
this
issue
of
how
the
are
treated
one
of
the
things
about
discriminating
against
people
or
treating
people
differently
is
by
definition
that
means
that
people
will
treat
you
differently
and
you
never
know
when
you
will
find
yourself
in
situation
in
which
you
are
minority
where
you
are
vulnerable
where
not
being
treated
fairly
and
right
now
obviously
our
focus
is
on
making
sure
that
those
who
are
being
subject
to
human
trafficking
and
are
in
some
cases
right
now
still
in
very
perilous
situation
out
in
the
open
sea
that
they
are
relocated
want
to
commend
and
malaysia
for
their
willingness
to
take
on
thousands
of
these
displaced
persons
the
united
states
as
part
of
our
refugee
process
will
take
some
we
put
over
million
over
the
last
several
years
in
burma
to
make
sure
that
minority
groups
including
the
are
protected
against
but
ultimately
this
is
going
to
be
great
test
for
the
democracy
of
the
future
not
just
in
burma
and
but
in
areas
all
throughout
the
country
when
was
and
know
this
directly
because
when
was
young
and
was
living
in
there
were
times
where
there
were
riots
that
were
very
violent
and
vicious
and
in
fact
sometimes
the
chinese
were
treated
very
similarly
to
how
jewish
were
treated
in
europe
and
subject
to
stereotypes
and
resentments
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
mentioned
earlier
has
been
successful
is
that
it
has
been
able
to
bring
together
people
who
may
look
different
but
they
all
think
of
themselves
as
part
of
and
that
has
to
be
strength
not
weakness
but
that
requires
leadership
and
government
being
true
to
those
principles
to
their
credit
the
government
when
was
growing
up
was
very
good
about
not
discriminating
on
the
base
of
religion
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
percent
muslim
and
think
that
the
tolerance
towards
other
faiths
historically
in
has
been
part
of
contributed
to
progress
there
you
seen
the
same
kind
of
sectarian
animosity
that
seen
in
parts
of
the
middle
east
but
the
one
thing
know
is
countries
that
divide
themselves
on
racial
or
religious
lines
they
do
not
succeed
they
do
not
succeed
rule
number
one
rule
number
two
is
nations
that
suppress
their
women
do
not
succeed
they
succeed
not
only
is
it
bad
because
half
of
the
country
is
not
successful
because
not
getting
education
and
opportunity
but
women
who
teach
children
which
means
the
children
are
less
educated
if
not
teaching
the
moms
so
there
are
some
each
country
is
different
but
there
are
some
rules
if
you
look
at
development
patterns
around
the
world
that
are
pretty
consistent
and
those
are
two
pretty
good
rules
divide
yourself
on
religious
and
ethnic
lines
and
racial
lines
and
discriminate
against
women
if
you
do
those
two
things
not
guaranteed
success
but
at
least
not
guaranteed
failure
got
time
for
one
more
two
more
definitely
have
time
for
more
two
more
got
time
for
two
more
turn
question
good
afternoon
president
from
malaysia
work
at
department
of
irrigation
and
drainage
in
malaysia
my
theme
is
environmental
sustainability
and
my
question
for
you
is
what
have
you
learned
about
leadership
and
life
as
being
president
in
comparison
to
what
you
have
might
not
learned
if
you
were
not
president
president
as
president
you
think
probably
what
makes
this
job
unique
is
that
you
are
the
ultimate
so
there
are
other
people
who
work
as
hard
as
do
my
staff
works
very
very
hard
they
just
as
smart
or
smarter
than
am
they
care
just
as
much
or
more
than
do
they
have
wonderful
qualities
but
the
one
thing
as
president
is
that
ultimately
nobody
you
can
pass
it
on
to
harry
one
of
our
best
presidents
once
said
the
buck
stops
here
he
meant
at
his
desk
and
true
and
usually
by
the
time
decision
comes
to
my
desk
you
know
that
very
hard
problem
because
if
it
was
easy
somebody
else
would
have
solved
it
and
so
probably
the
thing
that
uniquely
have
had
to
learn
in
the
presidency
that
is
learned
as
well
in
other
jobs
is
the
ability
to
look
at
all
the
information
that
you
have
listen
to
all
the
advice
that
there
and
the
different
viewpoints
that
may
exist
about
an
issue
to
try
to
make
decision
based
not
on
what
is
easiest
but
what
think
is
the
best
solution
and
then
feel
comfortable
in
the
knowledge
that
may
be
wrong
and
that
there
will
be
significant
consequences
if
am
wrong
to
have
to
have
the
courage
then
maybe
six
months
later
or
year
later
to
admit
this
did
work
and
then
to
try
something
new
but
being
willing
to
take
responsibility
for
making
hard
decisions
not
be
because
you
know
there
are
big
consequences
to
them
and
then
being
able
to
adapt
based
on
the
evidence
as
to
whether
it
worked
or
not
think
is
the
most
important
lesson
learned
and
that
not
something
that
you
have
to
is
just
unique
to
being
president
think
in
whatever
your
job
is
you
should
be
willing
to
take
responsibility
for
getting
the
best
information
to
listening
to
everybody
but
then
you
have
to
just
you
have
to
make
decision
and
understand
then
that
you
have
to
continue
to
evaluate
it
and
think
that
that
been
very
important
the
second
lesson
which
is
something
that
you
just
learn
more
of
as
president
but
all
of
you
have
already
learned
in
some
ways
in
your
work
is
to
surround
yourself
with
the
best
people
your
most
important
job
is
to
create
team
of
people
some
of
whom
have
talents
that
you
do
have
to
make
up
for
your
weaknesses
and
then
to
want
to
make
them
better
and
make
them
successful
because
if
they
successful
then
the
team
is
successful
so
you
not
good
leader
if
you
do
want
somebody
who
is
smarter
than
you
because
you
think
oh
well
maybe
shine
more
than
you
do
then
you
not
very
good
leader
because
your
team
succeed
so
always
looking
for
who
are
people
who
are
much
smarter
than
me
or
much
more
than
am
or
much
better
analysts
and
my
job
then
is
just
to
be
able
to
weave
them
together
so
they
all
working
together
effectively
and
if
you
doing
that
then
you
good
leader
and
you
should
be
constantly
thinking
how
can
help
this
person
do
their
jobs
even
better
and
the
good
news
is
if
you
do
that
and
people
that
you
care
about
them
being
successful
then
work
harder
and
want
to
do
even
better
and
appreciate
you
because
they
know
that
you
helping
them
instead
of
trying
to
keep
them
subordinate
to
you
last
question
and
all
the
men
should
put
down
their
hands
because
turn
no
all
the
guys
have
to
put
their
hands
down
this
young
lady
in
the
yellow
right
here
right
in
the
corner
right
here
question
thank
you
president
good
afternoon
sir
from
currently
working
for
the
institute
for
development
and
first
of
all
would
like
to
say
thank
you
to
you
for
giving
us
this
unique
opportunity
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
to
meet
you
today
my
question
for
you
is
what
is
your
opinion
about
disputes
and
action
in
the
east
sea
or
the
south
china
sea
president
well
as
already
mentioned
what
has
allowed
all
of
asia
to
prosper
over
the
last
two
three
decades
including
china
is
been
relative
peace
and
stability
freedom
of
navigation
freedom
of
commerce
and
all
of
that
has
been
underwritten
all
of
that
has
been
because
there
have
been
certain
rules
that
everybody
has
followed
freedom
of
navigation
requires
that
people
observe
basic
conduct
about
this
far
off
your
territory
is
your
territory
after
that
international
waters
if
dispute
then
international
mechanisms
to
adjudicate
that
dispute
if
you
start
losing
that
approach
and
suddenly
conflicts
arise
and
claims
are
made
based
on
how
big
the
country
is
or
how
powerful
its
navy
is
instead
of
based
on
law
then
think
asia
will
be
less
prosperous
and
the
pacific
region
will
be
less
prosperous
and
why
said
directly
to
china
and
to
other
claimant
countries
we
have
claim
to
these
areas
not
parties
in
the
dispute
but
we
do
have
stake
in
making
sure
that
they
are
resolved
peacefully
diplomatically
and
in
accordance
with
internationally
established
standards
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
land
reclamation
aggressive
actions
by
any
party
in
that
area
are
counterproductive
and
we
will
continue
as
an
asia
pacific
power
to
support
all
countries
who
are
prepared
to
work
with
us
to
establish
and
enforce
norms
and
rules
that
can
continue
growth
and
prosperity
in
the
region
and
the
truth
is
is
that
china
is
going
to
be
successful
big
powerful
its
people
are
talented
and
they
work
hard
and
it
may
be
that
some
of
their
claims
are
legitimate
but
they
just
try
to
establish
that
based
on
throwing
elbows
and
pushing
people
out
of
the
way
if
in
fact
their
claims
are
legitimate
people
will
them
will
say
this
though
that
am
very
confident
much
more
confident
in
the
future
of
asia
the
asia
pacific
and
the
world
because
had
the
opportunity
to
spend
time
with
you
think
all
of
you
are
going
to
do
outstanding
work
and
want
to
make
sure
that
you
know
that
not
only
will
this
administration
and
the
united
states
government
continue
to
support
the
work
that
you
do
but
personally
even
after
leave
office
will
continue
to
have
great
interest
in
seeing
not
only
you
succeed
but
those
coming
behind
you
young
people
like
yourself
succeed
and
think
you
should
be
interested
in
making
sure
to
promote
and
the
network
and
try
to
provide
similar
opportunities
to
other
young
people
as
you
become
more
important
in
whatever
your
fields
are
in
the
future
congratulations
good
luck
at
the
dawn
of
our
republic
small
secret
surveillance
committee
borne
out
of
the
the
sons
of
liberty
was
established
in
boston
and
the
members
included
paul
revere
at
night
they
would
patrol
the
streets
reporting
back
any
signs
that
the
british
were
preparing
raids
against
early
patriots
throughout
american
history
intelligence
has
helped
secure
our
country
and
our
freedoms
in
the
civil
war
union
balloon
reconnaissance
tracked
the
size
of
confederate
armies
by
counting
the
number
of
campfires
in
world
war
gave
us
insights
into
war
plans
and
when
marched
across
europe
intercepted
communications
helped
save
the
lives
of
his
troops
after
the
war
the
rise
of
the
iron
curtain
and
nuclear
weapons
only
increased
the
need
for
sustained
intelligence
gathering
and
so
in
the
early
days
of
the
cold
war
president
created
the
national
security
agency
or
to
give
us
insights
into
the
soviet
bloc
and
provide
our
leaders
with
information
they
needed
to
confront
aggression
and
avert
catastrophe
throughout
this
evolution
we
benefited
from
both
our
constitution
and
our
traditions
of
limited
government
intelligence
agencies
were
anchored
in
system
of
checks
and
balances
with
oversight
from
elected
leaders
and
protections
for
ordinary
citizens
meanwhile
totalitarian
states
like
east
germany
offered
cautionary
tale
of
what
could
happen
when
vast
unchecked
surveillance
turned
citizens
into
informers
and
persecuted
people
for
what
they
said
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
homes
in
fact
even
the
united
states
proved
not
to
be
immune
to
the
abuse
of
surveillance
and
in
the
government
spied
on
civil
rights
leaders
and
critics
of
the
war
and
partly
in
response
to
these
revelations
additional
laws
were
established
in
the
to
ensure
that
our
intelligence
capabilities
could
not
be
misused
against
our
citizens
in
the
long
twilight
struggle
against
communism
we
had
been
reminded
that
the
very
liberties
that
we
sought
to
preserve
could
not
be
sacrificed
at
the
altar
of
national
security
if
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
left
america
without
competing
superpower
emerging
threats
from
terrorist
groups
and
the
proliferation
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
placed
new
and
in
some
ways
more
complicated
demands
on
our
intelligence
agencies
and
the
internet
made
these
threats
more
acute
as
technology
erased
borders
and
empowered
individuals
to
project
great
violence
as
well
as
great
good
moreover
these
new
threats
raised
new
legal
and
new
policy
questions
for
while
few
doubted
the
legitimacy
of
spying
on
hostile
states
our
framework
of
laws
was
not
fully
adapted
to
prevent
terrorist
attacks
by
individuals
acting
on
their
own
or
acting
in
small
ideologically
driven
groups
on
behalf
of
foreign
power
the
horror
of
september
brought
all
these
issues
to
the
fore
across
the
political
spectrum
americans
that
we
had
to
adapt
to
world
in
which
bomb
could
be
built
in
basement
and
our
electric
grid
could
be
shut
down
by
operators
an
ocean
away
we
were
shaken
by
the
signs
we
had
missed
leading
up
to
the
attacks
how
the
hijackers
had
made
phone
calls
to
known
extremists
and
to
suspicious
places
so
we
demanded
that
our
intelligence
community
improve
its
capabilities
and
that
law
enforcement
change
practices
to
focus
more
on
preventing
attacks
before
they
happen
than
prosecuting
terrorists
after
an
attack
it
is
hard
to
overstate
the
transformation
intelligence
community
had
to
go
through
after
our
agencies
suddenly
needed
to
do
far
more
than
the
traditional
mission
of
monitoring
hostile
powers
and
gathering
information
for
instead
they
were
now
asked
to
identify
and
target
plotters
in
some
of
the
most
remote
parts
of
the
world
and
to
anticipate
the
actions
of
networks
that
by
their
very
nature
can
not
be
easily
penetrated
with
spies
or
informants
and
it
is
testimony
to
the
hard
work
and
dedication
of
the
men
and
women
of
our
intelligence
community
that
over
the
past
decade
made
enormous
strides
in
fulfilling
this
mission
today
new
capabilities
allow
intelligence
agencies
to
track
who
terrorist
is
in
contact
with
and
follow
the
trail
of
his
travel
or
his
funding
new
laws
allow
information
to
be
collected
and
shared
more
quickly
and
effectively
between
federal
agencies
and
state
and
local
law
enforcement
relationships
with
foreign
intelligence
services
have
expanded
and
our
capacity
to
repel
have
been
strengthened
and
taken
together
these
efforts
have
prevented
multiple
attacks
and
saved
innocent
lives
not
just
here
in
the
united
states
but
around
the
globe
and
yet
in
our
rush
to
respond
to
very
real
and
novel
set
of
threats
the
risk
of
government
overreach
the
possibility
that
we
lose
some
of
our
core
liberties
in
pursuit
of
security
also
became
more
pronounced
we
saw
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
our
government
engaged
in
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
that
contradicted
our
values
as
senator
was
critical
of
several
practices
such
as
and
all
too
often
new
authorities
were
instituted
without
adequate
public
debate
through
combination
of
action
by
the
courts
increased
congressional
oversight
and
adjustments
by
the
previous
administration
some
of
the
worst
excesses
that
emerged
after
were
curbed
by
the
time
took
office
but
variety
of
factors
have
continued
to
complicate
efforts
to
both
defend
our
nation
and
uphold
our
civil
liberties
first
the
same
technological
advances
that
allow
intelligence
agencies
to
pinpoint
an
cell
in
yemen
or
an
email
between
two
terrorists
in
the
also
mean
that
many
routine
communications
around
the
world
are
within
our
reach
and
at
time
when
more
and
more
of
our
lives
are
digital
that
prospect
is
disquieting
for
all
of
us
second
the
combination
of
increased
digital
information
and
powerful
supercomputers
offers
intelligence
agencies
the
possibility
of
sifting
through
massive
amounts
of
bulk
data
to
identify
patterns
or
pursue
leads
that
may
thwart
impending
threats
powerful
tool
but
the
government
collection
and
storage
of
such
bulk
data
also
creates
potential
for
abuse
third
the
legal
safeguards
that
restrict
surveillance
against
persons
without
warrant
do
not
apply
to
foreign
persons
overseas
this
is
not
unique
to
america
few
if
any
spy
agencies
around
the
world
constrain
their
activities
beyond
their
own
borders
and
the
whole
point
of
intelligence
is
to
obtain
information
that
is
not
publicly
available
but
capabilities
are
unique
and
the
power
of
new
technologies
means
that
there
are
fewer
and
fewer
technical
constraints
on
what
we
can
do
that
places
special
obligation
on
us
to
ask
tough
questions
about
what
we
should
do
and
finally
intelligence
agencies
can
not
function
without
secrecy
which
makes
their
work
less
subject
to
public
debate
yet
there
is
an
inevitable
bias
not
only
within
the
intelligence
community
but
among
all
of
us
who
are
responsible
for
national
security
to
collect
more
information
about
the
world
not
less
so
in
the
absence
of
institutional
requirements
for
regular
debate
and
oversight
that
is
public
as
well
as
private
or
classified
the
danger
of
government
overreach
becomes
more
acute
and
this
is
particularly
true
when
surveillance
technology
and
our
reliance
on
digital
information
is
evolving
much
faster
than
our
laws
for
all
these
reasons
maintained
healthy
toward
our
surveillance
programs
after
became
president
ordered
that
our
programs
be
reviewed
by
my
national
security
team
and
our
lawyers
and
in
some
cases
ordered
changes
in
how
we
did
business
we
increased
oversight
and
auditing
including
new
structures
aimed
at
compliance
improved
rules
were
proposed
by
the
government
and
approved
by
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
and
we
sought
to
keep
congress
continually
updated
on
these
activities
what
did
not
do
is
stop
these
programs
wholesale
not
only
because
felt
that
they
made
us
more
secure
but
also
because
nothing
in
that
initial
review
and
nothing
that
have
learned
since
indicated
that
our
intelligence
community
has
sought
to
violate
the
law
or
is
cavalier
about
the
civil
liberties
of
their
fellow
citizens
to
the
contrary
in
an
extraordinarily
difficult
job
one
in
which
actions
are
success
is
unreported
and
failure
can
be
catastrophic
the
men
and
women
of
the
intelligence
community
including
the
consistently
follow
protocols
designed
to
protect
the
privacy
of
ordinary
people
not
abusing
authorities
in
order
to
listen
to
your
private
phone
calls
or
read
your
when
mistakes
are
made
which
is
inevitable
in
any
large
and
complicated
human
enterprise
they
correct
those
mistakes
in
obscurity
often
unable
to
discuss
their
work
even
with
family
and
friends
the
men
and
women
at
the
know
that
if
another
or
massive
occurs
they
will
be
asked
by
congress
and
the
media
why
they
failed
to
connect
the
dots
what
sustains
those
who
work
at
and
our
other
intelligence
agencies
through
all
these
pressures
is
the
knowledge
that
their
professionalism
and
dedication
play
central
role
in
the
of
our
nation
now
to
say
that
our
intelligence
community
follows
the
law
and
is
staffed
by
patriots
is
not
to
suggest
that
or
others
in
my
administration
felt
complacent
about
the
potential
impact
of
these
programs
those
of
us
who
hold
office
in
america
have
responsibility
to
our
constitution
and
while
was
confident
in
the
integrity
of
those
who
lead
our
intelligence
community
it
was
clear
to
me
in
observing
our
intelligence
operations
on
regular
basis
that
changes
in
our
technological
capabilities
were
raising
new
questions
about
the
privacy
safeguards
currently
in
place
moreover
after
an
extended
review
of
our
use
of
drones
in
the
fight
against
terrorist
networks
believed
fresh
examination
of
our
surveillance
programs
was
necessary
next
step
in
our
effort
to
get
off
the
war
footing
that
maintained
since
and
for
these
reasons
indicated
in
at
the
national
university
last
may
that
we
needed
more
robust
public
discussion
about
the
balance
between
security
and
liberty
of
course
what
did
not
know
at
the
time
is
that
within
weeks
of
my
an
avalanche
of
disclosures
would
spark
controversies
at
home
and
abroad
that
have
continued
to
this
day
and
given
the
fact
of
an
open
investigation
not
going
to
dwell
on
actions
or
his
motivations
will
say
that
our
depends
in
part
on
the
fidelity
of
those
entrusted
with
our
secrets
if
any
individual
who
objects
to
government
policy
can
take
it
into
their
own
hands
to
publicly
disclose
classified
information
then
we
will
not
be
able
to
keep
our
people
safe
or
conduct
foreign
policy
moreover
the
sensational
way
in
which
these
disclosures
have
come
out
has
often
shed
more
heat
than
light
while
revealing
methods
to
our
adversaries
that
could
impact
our
operations
in
ways
that
we
may
not
fully
understand
for
years
to
come
regardless
of
how
we
got
here
though
the
task
before
us
now
is
greater
than
simply
repairing
the
damage
done
to
our
operations
or
preventing
more
disclosures
from
taking
place
in
the
future
instead
we
have
to
make
some
important
decisions
about
how
to
protect
ourselves
and
sustain
our
leadership
in
the
world
while
upholding
the
civil
liberties
and
privacy
protections
that
our
ideals
and
our
constitution
require
we
need
to
do
so
not
only
because
it
is
right
but
because
the
challenges
posed
by
threats
like
terrorism
and
proliferation
and
are
not
going
away
any
time
soon
they
are
going
to
continue
to
be
major
problem
and
for
our
intelligence
community
to
be
effective
over
the
long
haul
we
must
maintain
the
trust
of
the
american
people
and
people
around
the
world
this
effort
will
not
be
completed
overnight
and
given
the
pace
of
technological
change
we
expect
this
to
be
the
last
time
america
has
this
debate
but
want
the
american
people
to
know
that
the
work
has
begun
over
the
last
six
months
created
an
outside
review
group
on
intelligence
and
communications
technologies
to
make
recommendations
for
reform
consulted
with
the
privacy
and
civil
liberties
oversight
board
created
by
congress
listened
to
foreign
partners
privacy
advocates
and
industry
leaders
my
administration
has
spent
countless
hours
considering
how
to
approach
intelligence
in
this
era
of
diffuse
threats
and
technological
revolution
so
before
outlining
specific
changes
that
ordered
let
me
make
few
broad
observations
that
have
emerged
from
this
process
first
everyone
who
has
looked
at
these
problems
including
of
existing
programs
that
we
have
real
enemies
and
threats
and
that
intelligence
serves
vital
role
in
confronting
them
we
can
not
prevent
terrorist
attacks
or
threats
without
some
capability
to
penetrate
digital
communications
whether
to
unravel
terrorist
plot
to
intercept
that
targets
stock
exchange
to
make
sure
air
traffic
control
systems
are
not
compromised
or
to
ensure
that
hackers
do
not
empty
your
bank
accounts
we
are
expected
to
protect
the
american
people
that
requires
us
to
have
capabilities
in
this
field
moreover
we
can
not
unilaterally
disarm
our
intelligence
agencies
there
is
reason
why
and
are
not
allowed
in
the
white
house
situation
room
we
know
that
the
intelligence
services
of
other
countries
including
some
who
feign
surprise
over
the
disclosures
are
constantly
probing
our
government
and
private
sector
networks
and
accelerating
programs
to
listen
to
our
conversations
and
intercept
our
and
compromise
our
systems
we
know
that
meanwhile
number
of
countries
including
some
who
have
loudly
the
privately
acknowledge
that
america
has
special
responsibilities
as
the
only
superpower
that
our
intelligence
capabilities
are
critical
to
meeting
these
responsibilities
and
that
they
themselves
have
relied
on
the
information
we
obtain
to
protect
their
own
people
second
just
as
ardent
civil
libertarians
the
need
for
robust
intelligence
capabilities
those
with
responsibilities
for
our
national
security
readily
acknowledge
the
potential
for
abuse
as
intelligence
capabilities
advance
and
more
and
more
private
information
is
after
all
the
folks
at
and
other
intelligence
agencies
are
our
they
our
friends
and
family
got
electronic
bank
and
medical
records
like
everybody
else
they
have
kids
on
and
and
they
know
more
than
most
of
us
the
vulnerabilities
to
privacy
that
exist
in
world
where
transactions
are
recorded
and
and
text
and
messages
are
stored
and
even
our
movements
can
increasingly
be
tracked
through
the
on
our
phones
third
there
was
recognition
by
all
who
participated
in
these
reviews
that
the
challenges
to
our
privacy
do
not
come
from
government
alone
corporations
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
track
what
you
buy
store
and
our
data
and
use
it
for
commercial
purposes
how
those
targeted
pop
up
on
your
computer
and
your
periodically
but
all
of
us
understand
that
the
standards
for
government
surveillance
must
be
higher
given
the
unique
power
of
the
state
it
is
not
enough
for
leaders
to
say
trust
us
we
abuse
the
data
we
collect
for
history
has
too
many
examples
when
that
trust
has
been
breached
our
system
of
government
is
built
on
the
premise
that
our
liberty
can
not
depend
on
the
good
intentions
of
those
in
power
it
depends
on
the
law
to
constrain
those
in
power
make
these
observations
to
that
the
basic
values
of
most
americans
when
it
comes
to
questions
of
surveillance
and
privacy
converge
lot
more
than
the
crude
that
have
emerged
over
the
last
several
months
those
who
are
troubled
by
our
existing
programs
are
not
interested
in
repeating
the
tragedy
of
and
those
who
defend
these
programs
are
not
dismissive
of
civil
liberties
the
challenge
is
getting
the
details
right
and
that
is
not
simple
in
fact
during
the
course
of
our
review
have
often
reminded
myself
would
not
be
where
am
today
were
it
not
for
the
courage
of
dissidents
like
king
who
were
spied
upon
by
their
own
government
and
as
president
president
who
looks
at
intelligence
every
morning
also
help
but
be
reminded
that
america
must
be
vigilant
in
the
face
of
threats
fortunately
by
focusing
on
facts
and
specifics
rather
than
speculation
and
this
review
process
has
given
me
and
hopefully
the
american
people
some
clear
direction
for
change
and
today
can
announce
series
of
concrete
and
substantial
reforms
that
my
administration
intends
to
adopt
administratively
or
will
seek
to
codify
with
congress
first
have
approved
new
presidential
directive
for
our
signals
intelligence
activities
both
at
home
and
abroad
this
guidance
will
strengthen
executive
branch
oversight
of
our
intelligence
activities
it
will
ensure
that
we
take
into
account
our
security
requirements
but
also
our
alliances
our
trade
and
investment
relationships
including
the
concerns
of
american
companies
and
our
commitment
to
privacy
and
basic
liberties
and
we
will
review
decisions
about
intelligence
priorities
and
sensitive
targets
on
an
annual
basis
so
that
our
actions
are
regularly
by
my
senior
national
security
team
second
we
will
reform
programs
and
procedures
in
place
to
provide
greater
transparency
to
our
surveillance
activities
and
fortify
the
safeguards
that
protect
the
privacy
of
persons
since
we
began
this
review
including
information
being
released
today
we
have
declassified
over
opinions
and
orders
of
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
which
provides
judicial
review
of
some
of
our
most
sensitive
intelligence
activities
including
the
section
program
targeting
foreign
individuals
overseas
and
the
section
telephone
program
and
going
forward
directing
the
director
of
national
intelligence
in
consultation
with
the
attorney
general
to
annually
review
for
the
purposes
of
declassification
any
future
opinions
of
the
court
with
broad
privacy
implications
and
to
report
to
me
and
to
congress
on
these
efforts
to
ensure
that
the
court
hears
broader
range
of
privacy
perspectives
am
also
calling
on
congress
to
the
establishment
of
panel
of
advocates
from
outside
government
to
provide
an
independent
voice
in
significant
cases
before
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
third
we
will
provide
additional
protections
for
activities
conducted
under
section
which
allows
the
government
to
intercept
the
communications
of
foreign
targets
overseas
who
have
information
important
for
our
national
security
specifically
am
asking
the
attorney
general
and
to
institute
reforms
that
place
additional
restrictions
on
ability
to
retain
search
and
use
in
criminal
cases
communications
between
americans
and
foreign
citizens
incidentally
collected
under
section
fourth
in
investigating
threats
the
also
relies
on
what
called
national
security
letters
which
can
require
companies
to
provide
specific
and
limited
information
to
the
government
without
disclosing
the
orders
to
the
subject
of
the
investigation
these
are
cases
in
which
it
important
that
the
subject
of
the
investigation
such
as
possible
terrorist
or
spy
tipped
off
but
we
can
and
should
be
more
transparent
in
how
government
uses
this
authority
have
therefore
directed
the
attorney
general
to
amend
how
we
use
national
security
letters
so
that
this
secrecy
will
not
be
indefinite
so
that
it
will
terminate
within
fixed
time
unless
the
government
demonstrates
real
need
for
further
secrecy
we
will
also
enable
communications
providers
to
make
public
more
information
than
ever
before
about
the
orders
that
they
have
received
to
provide
data
to
the
government
this
brings
me
to
the
program
that
has
generated
the
most
controversy
these
past
few
months
the
bulk
collection
of
telephone
records
under
section
let
me
repeat
what
said
when
this
story
first
broke
this
program
does
not
involve
the
content
of
phone
calls
or
the
names
of
people
making
calls
instead
it
provides
record
of
phone
numbers
and
the
times
and
lengths
of
calls
that
can
be
queried
if
and
when
we
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
particular
number
is
linked
to
terrorist
why
is
this
necessary
the
program
grew
out
of
desire
to
address
gap
identified
after
one
of
the
hijackers
made
phone
call
from
san
to
known
in
yemen
saw
that
call
but
it
could
not
see
that
the
call
was
coming
from
an
individual
already
in
the
united
states
the
telephone
program
under
section
was
designed
to
map
the
communications
of
terrorists
so
we
can
see
who
they
may
be
in
contact
with
as
quickly
as
possible
and
this
capability
could
also
prove
valuable
in
crisis
for
example
if
bomb
goes
off
in
one
of
our
cities
and
law
enforcement
is
racing
to
determine
whether
network
is
poised
to
conduct
additional
attacks
time
is
of
the
essence
being
able
to
quickly
review
phone
connections
to
assess
whether
network
exists
is
critical
to
that
effort
in
sum
the
program
does
not
involve
the
examining
the
phone
records
of
ordinary
americans
rather
it
consolidates
these
records
into
database
that
the
government
can
query
if
it
has
specific
lead
consolidation
of
phone
records
that
the
companies
already
retained
for
business
purposes
the
review
group
turned
up
no
indication
that
this
database
has
been
intentionally
abused
and
believe
it
is
important
that
the
capability
that
this
program
is
designed
to
meet
is
preserved
having
said
that
believe
critics
are
right
to
point
out
that
without
proper
safeguards
this
type
of
program
could
be
used
to
yield
more
information
about
our
private
lives
and
open
the
door
to
more
intrusive
bulk
collection
programs
in
the
future
also
right
to
point
out
that
although
the
telephone
bulk
collection
program
was
subject
to
oversight
by
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
and
has
been
repeatedly
by
congress
it
has
never
been
subject
to
vigorous
public
debate
for
all
these
reasons
believe
we
need
new
approach
am
therefore
ordering
transition
that
will
end
the
section
bulk
program
as
it
currently
exists
and
establish
mechanism
that
preserves
the
capabilities
we
need
without
the
government
holding
this
bulk
this
will
not
be
simple
the
review
group
recommended
that
our
current
approach
be
replaced
by
one
in
which
the
providers
or
third
party
retain
the
bulk
records
with
government
accessing
information
as
needed
both
of
these
options
pose
difficult
problems
relying
solely
on
the
records
of
multiple
providers
for
example
could
require
companies
to
alter
their
procedures
in
ways
that
raise
new
privacy
concerns
on
the
other
hand
any
third
party
maintaining
single
consolidated
database
would
be
carrying
out
what
is
essentially
government
function
but
with
more
expense
more
legal
ambiguity
potentially
less
accountability
all
of
which
would
have
doubtful
impact
on
increasing
public
confidence
that
their
privacy
is
being
protected
during
the
review
process
some
suggested
that
we
may
also
be
able
to
preserve
the
capabilities
we
need
through
combination
of
existing
authorities
better
information
sharing
and
recent
technological
advances
but
more
work
needs
to
be
done
to
determine
exactly
how
this
system
might
work
because
of
the
challenges
involved
ordered
that
the
transition
away
from
the
existing
program
will
proceed
in
two
steps
effective
immediately
we
will
only
pursue
phone
calls
that
are
two
steps
removed
from
number
associated
with
terrorist
instead
of
the
current
three
and
have
directed
the
attorney
general
to
work
with
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
so
that
during
this
transition
period
the
database
can
be
queried
only
after
judicial
finding
or
in
the
case
of
true
emergency
next
step
two
have
instructed
the
intelligence
community
and
the
attorney
general
to
use
this
transition
period
to
develop
options
for
new
approach
that
can
match
the
capabilities
and
fill
the
gaps
that
the
section
program
was
designed
to
address
without
the
government
holding
this
itself
they
will
report
back
to
me
with
options
for
alternative
approaches
before
the
program
comes
up
for
on
march
and
during
this
period
will
consult
with
the
relevant
committees
in
congress
to
seek
their
views
and
then
seek
congressional
for
the
new
program
as
needed
now
the
reforms
proposing
today
should
give
the
american
people
greater
confidence
that
their
rights
are
being
protected
even
as
our
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
agencies
maintain
the
tools
they
need
to
keep
us
safe
and
that
there
are
additional
issues
that
require
further
debate
for
example
some
who
participated
in
our
review
as
well
as
some
members
of
congress
would
like
to
see
more
sweeping
reforms
to
the
use
of
national
security
letters
so
that
we
have
to
go
to
judge
each
time
before
issuing
these
requests
here
have
concerns
that
we
should
not
set
standard
for
terrorism
investigations
that
is
higher
than
those
involved
in
investigating
an
ordinary
crime
but
agree
that
greater
oversight
on
the
use
of
these
letters
may
be
appropriate
and
prepared
to
work
with
congress
on
this
issue
there
are
also
those
who
would
like
to
see
different
changes
to
the
court
than
the
ones
proposed
on
all
these
issues
am
open
to
working
with
congress
to
ensure
that
we
build
broad
consensus
for
how
to
move
forward
and
confident
that
we
can
shape
an
approach
that
meets
our
security
needs
while
upholding
the
civil
liberties
of
every
american
let
me
now
turn
to
the
separate
set
of
concerns
that
have
been
raised
overseas
and
focus
on
approach
to
intelligence
collection
abroad
as
indicated
the
united
states
has
unique
responsibilities
when
it
comes
to
intelligence
collection
our
capabilities
help
protect
not
only
our
nation
but
our
friends
and
our
allies
as
well
but
our
efforts
will
only
be
effective
if
ordinary
citizens
in
other
countries
have
confidence
that
the
united
states
respects
their
privacy
too
and
the
leaders
of
our
close
friends
and
allies
deserve
to
know
that
if
want
to
know
what
they
think
about
an
issue
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
them
rather
than
turning
to
surveillance
in
other
words
just
as
we
balance
security
and
privacy
at
home
our
global
leadership
demands
that
we
balance
our
security
requirements
against
our
need
to
maintain
the
trust
and
cooperation
among
people
and
leaders
around
the
world
for
that
reason
the
new
presidential
directive
that
issued
today
will
clearly
prescribe
what
we
do
and
do
not
do
when
it
comes
to
our
overseas
surveillance
to
begin
with
the
directive
makes
clear
that
the
united
states
only
uses
signals
intelligence
for
legitimate
national
security
purposes
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
indiscriminately
reviewing
the
or
phone
calls
of
ordinary
folks
also
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
does
not
collect
intelligence
to
suppress
criticism
or
dissent
nor
do
we
collect
intelligence
to
disadvantage
people
on
the
basis
of
their
ethnicity
or
race
or
gender
or
sexual
orientation
or
religious
beliefs
we
do
not
collect
intelligence
to
provide
competitive
advantage
to
companies
or
commercial
sectors
and
in
terms
of
our
bulk
collection
of
signals
intelligence
intelligence
agencies
will
only
use
such
data
to
meet
specific
security
requirements
counterintelligence
force
protection
for
our
troops
and
our
allies
and
combating
transnational
crime
including
sanctions
evasion
in
this
directive
have
taken
the
unprecedented
step
of
extending
certain
protections
that
we
have
for
the
american
people
to
people
overseas
directed
the
in
consultation
with
the
attorney
general
to
develop
these
safeguards
which
will
limit
the
duration
that
we
can
hold
personal
information
while
also
restricting
the
use
of
this
information
the
bottom
line
is
that
people
around
the
world
regardless
of
their
nationality
should
know
that
the
united
states
is
not
spying
on
ordinary
people
who
threaten
our
national
security
and
that
we
take
their
privacy
concerns
into
account
in
our
policies
and
procedures
this
applies
to
foreign
leaders
as
well
given
the
understandable
attention
that
this
issue
has
received
have
made
clear
to
the
intelligence
community
that
unless
there
is
compelling
national
security
purpose
we
will
not
monitor
the
communications
of
heads
of
state
and
government
of
our
close
friends
and
allies
and
instructed
my
national
security
team
as
well
as
the
intelligence
community
to
work
with
foreign
counterparts
to
deepen
our
coordination
and
cooperation
in
ways
that
rebuild
trust
going
forward
now
let
me
be
clear
our
intelligence
agencies
will
continue
to
gather
information
about
the
intentions
of
governments
as
opposed
to
ordinary
citizens
around
the
world
in
the
same
way
that
the
intelligence
services
of
every
other
nation
does
we
will
not
simply
because
our
services
may
be
more
effective
but
heads
of
state
and
government
with
whom
we
work
closely
and
on
whose
cooperation
we
depend
should
feel
confident
that
we
are
treating
them
as
real
partners
and
the
changes
ordered
do
just
that
finally
to
make
sure
that
we
follow
through
on
all
these
reforms
am
making
some
important
changes
to
how
our
government
is
the
state
department
will
designate
senior
officer
to
coordinate
our
diplomacy
on
issues
related
to
technology
and
signals
intelligence
we
will
appoint
senior
official
at
the
white
house
to
implement
the
new
privacy
safeguards
that
have
announced
today
will
devote
the
resources
to
and
improve
the
process
we
use
to
handle
foreign
requests
for
legal
assistance
keeping
our
high
standards
for
privacy
while
helping
foreign
partners
fight
crime
and
terrorism
have
also
asked
my
john
to
lead
comprehensive
review
of
big
data
and
privacy
and
this
group
will
consist
of
government
officials
who
along
with
the
council
of
on
science
and
technology
will
reach
out
to
privacy
experts
technologists
and
business
leaders
and
look
how
the
challenges
inherent
in
big
data
are
being
confronted
by
both
the
public
and
private
sectors
whether
we
can
forge
international
norms
on
how
to
manage
this
data
and
how
we
can
continue
to
promote
the
free
flow
of
information
in
ways
that
are
consistent
with
both
privacy
and
security
for
ultimately
at
stake
in
this
debate
goes
far
beyond
few
months
of
headlines
or
passing
tensions
in
our
foreign
policy
when
you
cut
through
the
noise
really
at
stake
is
how
we
remain
true
to
who
we
are
in
world
that
is
remaking
itself
at
dizzying
speed
whether
the
ability
of
individuals
to
communicate
ideas
to
access
information
that
would
have
once
filled
every
great
library
in
every
country
in
the
world
or
to
forge
bonds
with
people
on
other
sides
of
the
globe
technology
is
remaking
what
is
possible
for
individuals
and
for
institutions
and
for
the
international
order
so
while
the
reforms
that
have
announced
will
point
us
in
new
direction
am
mindful
that
more
work
will
be
needed
in
the
future
one
thing
certain
of
this
debate
will
make
us
stronger
and
also
know
that
in
this
time
of
change
the
united
states
of
america
will
have
to
lead
it
may
seem
sometimes
that
america
is
being
held
to
different
standard
and
admit
the
readiness
of
some
to
assume
the
worst
motives
by
our
government
can
be
frustrating
no
one
expects
china
to
have
an
open
debate
about
their
surveillance
programs
or
russia
to
take
privacy
concerns
of
citizens
in
other
places
into
account
but
remember
we
are
held
to
different
standard
precisely
because
we
have
been
at
the
forefront
of
defending
personal
privacy
and
human
dignity
as
the
nation
that
developed
the
internet
the
world
expects
us
to
ensure
that
the
digital
revolution
works
as
tool
for
individual
empowerment
not
government
control
having
faced
down
the
dangers
of
totalitarianism
and
fascism
and
communism
the
world
expects
us
to
stand
up
for
the
principle
that
every
person
has
the
right
to
think
and
write
and
form
relationships
freely
because
individual
freedom
is
the
of
human
progress
those
values
make
us
who
we
are
and
because
of
the
strength
of
our
own
democracy
we
should
not
shy
away
from
high
expectations
for
more
than
two
centuries
our
constitution
has
weathered
every
type
of
change
because
we
have
been
willing
to
defend
it
and
because
we
have
been
willing
to
question
the
actions
that
have
been
taken
in
its
today
is
no
different
believe
we
can
meet
high
expectations
together
let
us
chart
way
forward
that
secures
the
life
of
our
nation
while
preserving
the
liberties
that
make
our
nation
worth
fighting
for
thank
you
god
bless
you
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
to
and
the
mandela
family
to
president
and
members
of
the
government
to
heads
of
states
and
government
past
and
present
distinguished
guests
it
is
singular
to
be
with
you
today
to
celebrate
life
like
no
other
to
the
people
of
south
africa
people
of
every
race
and
walk
of
life
the
world
thanks
you
for
sharing
mandela
with
us
his
struggle
was
your
struggle
his
triumph
was
your
triumph
your
dignity
and
your
hope
found
expression
in
his
life
and
your
freedom
your
democracy
is
his
cherished
legacy
it
is
hard
to
any
man
to
capture
in
words
not
just
the
facts
and
the
dates
that
make
life
but
the
essential
truth
of
person
their
private
joys
and
sorrows
the
quiet
moments
and
unique
qualities
that
illuminate
soul
how
much
harder
to
do
so
for
giant
of
history
who
moved
nation
toward
justice
and
in
the
process
moved
billions
around
the
world
born
during
world
war
far
from
the
corridors
of
power
boy
raised
herding
cattle
and
tutored
by
the
elders
of
his
tribe
would
emerge
as
the
last
great
liberator
of
the
century
like
gandhi
he
would
lead
resistance
movement
movement
that
at
its
start
had
little
prospect
for
success
like
king
he
would
give
potent
voice
to
the
claims
of
the
oppressed
and
the
moral
necessity
of
racial
justice
he
would
endure
brutal
imprisonment
that
began
in
the
time
of
kennedy
and
and
reached
the
final
days
of
the
cold
war
emerging
from
prison
without
the
force
of
arms
he
would
like
abraham
lincoln
hold
his
country
together
when
it
threatened
to
break
apart
and
like
founding
fathers
he
would
erect
constitutional
order
to
preserve
freedom
for
future
generations
commitment
to
democracy
and
rule
of
law
ratified
not
only
by
his
election
but
by
his
willingness
to
step
down
from
power
after
only
one
term
given
the
sweep
of
his
life
the
scope
of
his
accomplishments
the
adoration
that
he
so
rightly
earned
tempting
think
to
remember
mandela
as
an
icon
smiling
and
serene
detached
from
the
tawdry
affairs
of
lesser
men
but
himself
strongly
resisted
such
lifeless
portrait
instead
insisted
on
sharing
with
us
his
doubts
and
his
fears
his
miscalculations
along
with
his
victories
am
not
saint
he
said
unless
you
think
of
saint
as
sinner
who
keeps
on
trying
it
was
precisely
because
he
could
admit
to
imperfection
because
he
could
be
so
full
of
good
even
mischief
despite
the
heavy
burdens
he
carried
that
we
loved
him
so
he
was
not
bust
made
of
marble
he
was
man
of
flesh
and
blood
son
and
husband
father
and
friend
and
why
we
learned
so
much
from
him
and
why
we
can
learn
from
him
still
for
nothing
he
achieved
was
inevitable
in
the
arc
of
his
life
we
see
man
who
earned
his
place
in
history
through
struggle
and
shrewdness
and
persistence
and
faith
he
tells
us
what
is
possible
not
just
in
the
pages
of
history
books
but
in
our
own
lives
as
well
mandela
showed
us
the
power
of
action
of
taking
risks
on
behalf
of
our
ideals
perhaps
was
right
that
he
inherited
proud
rebelliousness
stubborn
sense
of
fairness
from
his
father
and
we
know
he
shared
with
millions
of
black
and
south
africans
the
anger
born
of
thousand
slights
thousand
indignities
thousand
unremembered
desire
to
fight
the
system
that
imprisoned
my
people
he
said
but
like
other
early
giants
of
the
the
and
disciplined
his
anger
and
his
desire
to
fight
into
and
platforms
and
strategies
for
action
so
men
and
women
could
stand
up
for
their
dignity
moreover
he
accepted
the
consequences
of
his
actions
knowing
that
standing
up
to
powerful
interests
and
injustice
carries
price
have
fought
against
white
domination
and
have
fought
against
black
domination
cherished
the
ideal
of
democratic
and
free
society
in
which
all
persons
live
together
in
harmony
and
with
equal
opportunities
it
is
an
ideal
which
hope
to
live
for
and
to
achieve
but
if
needs
be
it
is
an
ideal
for
which
am
prepared
to
mandela
taught
us
the
power
of
action
but
he
also
taught
us
the
power
of
ideas
the
importance
of
reason
and
arguments
the
need
to
study
not
only
those
who
you
agree
with
but
also
those
who
you
agree
with
he
understood
that
ideas
can
not
be
contained
by
prison
walls
or
extinguished
by
bullet
he
turned
his
trial
into
an
indictment
of
because
of
his
eloquence
and
his
passion
but
also
because
of
his
training
as
an
advocate
he
used
decades
in
prison
to
sharpen
his
arguments
but
also
to
spread
his
thirst
for
knowledge
to
others
in
the
movement
and
he
learned
the
language
and
the
customs
of
his
oppressor
so
that
one
day
he
might
better
convey
to
them
how
their
own
freedom
depend
upon
his
mandela
demonstrated
that
action
and
ideas
are
not
enough
no
matter
how
right
they
must
be
chiseled
into
law
and
institutions
he
was
practical
testing
his
beliefs
against
the
hard
surface
of
circumstance
and
history
on
core
principles
he
was
unyielding
which
is
why
he
could
rebuff
offers
of
unconditional
release
reminding
the
regime
that
prisoners
can
not
enter
into
contracts
but
as
he
showed
in
painstaking
negotiations
to
transfer
power
and
draft
new
laws
he
was
not
afraid
to
compromise
for
the
sake
of
larger
goal
and
because
he
was
not
only
leader
of
movement
but
skillful
politician
the
constitution
that
emerged
was
worthy
of
this
multiracial
democracy
true
to
his
vision
of
laws
that
protect
minority
as
well
as
majority
rights
and
the
precious
freedoms
of
every
south
african
and
finally
mandela
understood
the
ties
that
bind
the
human
spirit
there
is
word
in
south
africa
word
that
captures
greatest
gift
his
recognition
that
we
are
all
bound
together
in
ways
that
are
invisible
to
the
eye
that
there
is
oneness
to
humanity
that
we
achieve
ourselves
by
sharing
ourselves
with
others
and
caring
for
those
around
us
we
can
never
know
how
much
of
this
sense
was
innate
in
him
or
how
much
was
shaped
in
dark
and
solitary
cell
but
we
remember
the
gestures
large
and
small
introducing
his
jailers
as
guests
at
his
inauguration
taking
pitch
in
springbok
uniform
turning
his
heartbreak
into
call
to
confront
that
revealed
the
depth
of
his
empathy
and
his
understanding
he
not
only
embodied
he
taught
millions
to
find
that
truth
within
themselves
it
took
man
like
to
free
not
just
the
prisoner
but
the
jailer
as
well
to
show
that
you
must
trust
others
so
that
they
may
trust
you
to
teach
that
reconciliation
is
not
matter
of
ignoring
cruel
past
but
means
of
confronting
it
with
inclusion
and
generosity
and
truth
he
changed
laws
but
he
also
changed
hearts
for
the
people
of
south
africa
for
those
he
inspired
around
the
globe
passing
is
rightly
time
of
mourning
and
time
to
celebrate
heroic
life
but
believe
it
should
also
prompt
in
each
of
us
time
for
with
honesty
regardless
of
our
station
or
our
circumstance
we
must
ask
how
well
have
applied
his
lessons
in
my
own
life
question
ask
myself
as
man
and
as
president
we
know
that
like
south
africa
the
united
states
had
to
overcome
centuries
of
racial
subjugation
as
was
true
here
it
took
sacrifice
the
sacrifice
of
countless
people
known
and
unknown
to
see
the
dawn
of
new
day
and
are
beneficiaries
of
that
struggle
but
in
america
and
in
south
africa
and
in
countries
all
around
the
globe
we
can
not
allow
our
progress
to
cloud
the
fact
that
our
work
is
not
yet
done
the
struggles
that
follow
the
victory
of
formal
equality
or
universal
franchise
may
not
be
as
filled
with
drama
and
moral
clarity
as
those
that
came
before
but
they
are
no
less
important
for
around
the
world
today
we
still
see
children
suffering
from
hunger
and
disease
we
still
see
schools
we
still
see
young
people
without
prospects
for
the
future
around
the
world
today
men
and
women
are
still
imprisoned
for
their
political
beliefs
and
are
still
persecuted
for
what
they
look
like
and
how
they
worship
and
who
they
love
that
is
happening
today
and
so
we
too
must
act
on
behalf
of
justice
we
too
must
act
on
behalf
of
peace
there
are
too
many
people
who
happily
embrace
legacy
of
racial
reconciliation
but
passionately
resist
even
modest
reforms
that
would
challenge
chronic
poverty
and
growing
inequality
there
are
too
many
leaders
who
claim
solidarity
with
struggle
for
freedom
but
do
not
tolerate
dissent
from
their
own
people
and
there
are
too
many
of
us
on
the
sidelines
comfortable
in
complacency
or
cynicism
when
our
voices
must
be
heard
the
questions
we
face
today
how
to
promote
equality
and
justice
how
to
uphold
freedom
and
human
rights
how
to
end
conflict
and
sectarian
war
these
things
do
not
have
easy
answers
but
there
were
no
easy
answers
in
front
of
that
child
born
in
world
war
mandela
reminds
us
that
it
always
seems
impossible
until
it
is
done
south
africa
shows
that
is
true
south
africa
shows
we
can
change
that
we
can
choose
world
defined
not
by
our
differences
but
by
our
common
hopes
we
can
choose
world
defined
not
by
conflict
but
by
peace
and
justice
and
opportunity
we
will
never
see
the
likes
of
mandela
again
but
let
me
say
to
the
young
people
of
africa
and
the
young
people
around
the
world
you
too
can
make
his
work
your
own
over
years
ago
while
still
student
learned
of
mandela
and
the
struggles
taking
place
in
this
beautiful
land
and
it
stirred
something
in
me
it
woke
me
up
to
my
responsibilities
to
others
and
to
myself
and
it
set
me
on
an
improbable
journey
that
finds
me
here
today
and
while
will
always
fall
short
of
example
he
makes
me
want
to
be
better
man
he
speaks
to
best
inside
us
after
this
great
liberator
is
laid
to
rest
and
when
we
have
returned
to
our
cities
and
villages
and
rejoined
our
daily
routines
let
us
search
for
his
strength
let
us
search
for
his
largeness
of
spirit
somewhere
inside
of
ourselves
and
when
the
night
grows
dark
when
injustice
weighs
heavy
on
our
hearts
when
our
plans
seem
beyond
our
reach
let
us
think
of
and
the
words
that
brought
him
comfort
within
the
four
walls
of
his
cell
it
matters
not
how
strait
the
gate
how
charged
with
punishments
the
scroll
am
the
master
of
my
fate
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
what
magnificent
soul
it
was
we
will
miss
him
deeply
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
mandela
may
god
bless
the
people
of
south
africa
at
his
trial
in
mandela
closed
his
statement
from
the
dock
saying
have
fought
against
white
domination
and
have
fought
against
black
domination
have
cherished
the
ideal
of
democratic
and
free
society
in
which
all
persons
live
together
in
harmony
and
with
equal
opportunities
it
is
an
ideal
which
hope
to
live
for
and
to
achieve
but
if
needs
be
it
is
an
ideal
for
which
am
prepared
to
and
mandela
lived
for
that
ideal
and
he
made
it
real
he
achieved
more
than
could
be
expected
of
any
man
today
he
has
gone
home
and
we
have
lost
one
of
the
most
influential
courageous
and
profoundly
good
human
beings
that
any
of
us
will
share
time
with
on
this
earth
he
no
longer
belongs
to
us
he
belongs
to
the
ages
through
his
fierce
dignity
and
unbending
will
to
sacrifice
his
own
freedom
for
the
freedom
of
others
transformed
south
africa
and
moved
all
of
us
his
journey
from
prisoner
to
president
embodied
the
promise
that
human
beings
and
countries
can
change
for
the
better
his
commitment
to
transfer
power
and
reconcile
with
those
who
jailed
him
set
an
example
that
all
humanity
should
aspire
to
whether
in
the
lives
of
nations
or
our
own
personal
lives
and
the
fact
that
he
did
it
all
with
grace
and
good
and
an
ability
to
acknowledge
his
own
imperfections
only
makes
the
man
that
much
more
remarkable
as
he
once
said
am
not
saint
unless
you
think
of
saint
as
sinner
who
keeps
on
am
one
of
the
countless
millions
who
drew
inspiration
from
mandela
life
my
very
first
political
action
the
first
thing
ever
did
that
involved
an
issue
or
policy
or
politics
was
protest
against
studied
his
words
and
his
writings
the
day
that
he
was
released
from
prison
gave
me
sense
of
what
human
beings
can
do
when
guided
by
their
hopes
and
not
by
their
fears
and
like
so
many
around
the
globe
can
not
fully
imagine
my
own
life
without
the
example
that
mandela
set
and
so
long
as
live
will
do
what
can
to
learn
from
him
to
and
his
family
and
extend
our
deepest
sympathy
and
gratitude
for
sharing
this
extraordinary
man
with
us
his
work
meant
long
days
away
from
those
who
loved
him
the
most
and
only
hope
that
the
time
spent
with
him
these
last
few
weeks
brought
peace
and
comfort
to
his
family
to
the
people
of
south
africa
we
draw
strength
from
the
example
of
renewal
and
reconciliation
and
resilience
that
you
made
real
free
south
africa
at
peace
with
itself
an
example
to
the
world
and
legacy
to
the
nation
he
loved
we
will
not
likely
see
the
likes
of
mandela
again
so
it
falls
to
us
as
best
we
can
to
forward
the
example
that
he
set
to
make
decisions
guided
not
by
hate
but
by
love
to
never
discount
the
difference
that
one
person
can
make
to
strive
for
future
that
is
worthy
of
his
sacrifice
for
now
let
us
pause
and
give
thanks
for
the
fact
that
mandela
lived
man
who
took
history
in
his
hands
and
bent
the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
toward
justice
may
god
bless
his
memory
and
keep
him
in
peace
good
evening
today
the
united
states
together
with
our
close
allies
and
partners
took
an
important
first
step
toward
comprehensive
solution
that
addresses
our
concerns
with
the
islamic
republic
of
nuclear
program
since
took
office
made
clear
my
determination
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
as
said
many
times
my
strong
preference
is
to
resolve
this
issue
peacefully
and
extended
the
hand
of
diplomacy
yet
for
many
years
iran
has
been
unwilling
to
meet
its
obligations
to
the
international
community
so
my
administration
worked
with
congress
the
united
nations
security
council
and
countries
around
the
world
to
impose
unprecedented
sanctions
on
the
iranian
government
these
sanctions
have
had
substantial
impact
on
the
iranian
economy
and
with
the
election
of
new
iranian
president
earlier
this
year
an
opening
for
diplomacy
emerged
spoke
personally
with
president
of
iran
earlier
this
fall
secretary
has
met
multiple
times
with
foreign
minister
and
we
have
pursued
intensive
diplomacy
bilaterally
with
the
iranians
and
together
with
our
partners
the
united
kingdom
france
germany
russia
and
china
as
well
as
the
european
union
today
that
diplomacy
opened
up
new
path
toward
world
that
is
more
secure
future
in
which
we
can
verify
that
nuclear
program
is
peaceful
and
that
it
can
not
build
nuclear
weapon
while
announcement
is
just
first
step
it
achieves
great
deal
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
decade
we
have
halted
the
progress
of
the
iranian
nuclear
program
and
key
parts
of
the
program
will
be
rolled
back
iran
has
committed
to
halting
certain
levels
of
enrichment
and
part
of
its
stockpiles
iran
can
not
use
its
centrifuges
which
are
used
for
enriching
uranium
iran
can
not
install
or
start
up
new
centrifuges
and
its
production
of
centrifuges
will
be
limited
iran
will
halt
work
at
its
plutonium
reactor
and
new
inspections
will
provide
extensive
access
to
nuclear
facilities
and
allow
the
international
community
to
verify
whether
iran
is
keeping
its
commitments
these
are
substantial
limitations
which
will
help
prevent
iran
from
building
nuclear
weapon
simply
put
they
cut
off
most
likely
paths
to
bomb
meanwhile
this
first
step
will
create
time
and
space
over
the
next
six
months
for
more
negotiations
to
fully
address
our
comprehensive
concerns
about
the
iranian
program
and
because
of
this
agreement
iran
can
not
use
negotiations
as
cover
to
advance
its
program
on
our
side
the
united
states
and
our
friends
and
allies
have
agreed
to
provide
iran
with
modest
relief
while
continuing
to
apply
our
toughest
sanctions
we
will
refrain
from
imposing
new
sanctions
and
we
will
allow
the
iranian
government
access
to
portion
of
the
revenue
that
they
have
been
denied
through
sanctions
but
the
broader
architecture
of
sanctions
will
remain
in
place
and
we
will
continue
to
enforce
them
vigorously
and
if
iran
does
not
fully
meet
its
commitments
during
this
phase
we
will
turn
off
the
relief
and
up
the
pressure
over
the
next
six
months
we
will
work
to
negotiate
comprehensive
solution
we
approach
these
negotiations
with
basic
understanding
iran
like
any
nation
should
be
able
to
access
peaceful
nuclear
energy
but
because
of
its
record
of
violating
its
obligations
iran
must
accept
strict
limitations
on
its
nuclear
program
that
make
it
impossible
to
develop
nuclear
weapon
in
these
negotiations
nothing
will
be
agreed
to
unless
everything
is
agreed
to
the
burden
is
on
iran
to
prove
to
the
world
that
its
nuclear
program
will
be
exclusively
for
peaceful
purposes
if
iran
seizes
this
opportunity
the
iranian
people
will
benefit
from
rejoining
the
international
community
and
we
can
begin
to
chip
away
at
the
mistrust
between
our
two
nations
this
would
provide
iran
with
dignified
path
to
forge
new
beginning
with
the
wider
world
based
on
mutual
respect
if
on
the
other
hand
iran
refuses
it
will
face
growing
pressure
and
isolation
over
the
last
few
years
congress
has
been
key
partner
in
imposing
sanctions
on
the
iranian
government
and
that
bipartisan
effort
made
possible
the
progress
that
was
achieved
today
going
forward
we
will
continue
to
work
closely
with
congress
however
now
is
not
the
time
to
move
forward
on
new
sanctions
because
doing
so
would
derail
this
promising
first
step
alienate
us
from
our
allies
and
risk
the
coalition
that
enabled
our
sanctions
to
be
enforced
in
the
first
place
that
international
unity
is
on
display
today
the
world
is
united
in
support
of
our
determination
to
prevent
iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapon
iran
must
know
that
security
and
prosperity
will
never
come
through
the
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
it
must
be
reached
through
fully
verifiable
agreements
that
make
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
impossible
as
we
go
forward
the
resolve
of
the
united
states
will
remain
firm
as
will
our
commitments
to
our
friends
and
allies
particularly
israel
and
our
gulf
partners
who
have
good
reason
to
be
about
intentions
ultimately
only
diplomacy
can
bring
about
durable
solution
to
the
challenge
posed
by
nuclear
program
as
president
and
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
but
have
profound
responsibility
to
try
to
resolve
our
differences
peacefully
rather
than
rush
towards
conflict
today
we
have
real
opportunity
to
achieve
comprehensive
peaceful
settlement
and
believe
we
must
test
it
the
first
step
that
taken
today
marks
the
most
significant
and
tangible
progress
that
made
with
iran
since
took
office
and
now
we
must
use
the
months
ahead
to
pursue
lasting
and
comprehensive
settlement
that
would
resolve
an
issue
that
has
threatened
our
security
and
the
security
of
our
allies
for
decades
it
be
easy
and
huge
challenges
remain
ahead
but
through
strong
and
principled
diplomacy
the
united
states
of
america
will
do
our
part
on
behalf
of
world
of
greater
peace
security
and
cooperation
among
nations
good
morning
everybody
good
afternoon
today
want
to
update
the
american
people
on
our
efforts
to
implement
and
improve
the
affordable
care
act
and
take
couple
of
your
questions
but
before
do
just
want
to
say
few
words
about
the
tragedy
that
unfolded
in
the
over
the
past
few
days
think
all
of
us
have
been
shaken
by
the
images
of
the
devastation
wrought
by
typhoon
heartbreaking
reminder
of
how
fragile
life
is
and
among
the
dead
are
several
americans
so
our
prayers
are
with
the
people
and
with
americans
across
our
country
who
are
anxious
about
their
family
and
friends
back
home
one
of
our
core
principles
is
when
friends
are
in
trouble
america
helps
as
told
president
earlier
this
week
the
united
states
will
continue
to
offer
whatever
assistance
we
can
our
military
personnel
and
team
do
this
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
and
been
already
on
the
ground
working
tirelessly
to
deliver
food
water
medicine
shelter
and
to
help
with
airlift
today
the
aircraft
carrier
george
washington
and
other
ships
arrived
to
help
with
as
well
as
supplies
medical
care
and
logistical
support
and
more
help
is
on
the
way
strength
of
course
has
always
been
more
than
just
about
what
our
government
can
do
also
about
what
our
citizens
can
do
about
the
of
the
american
people
when
they
see
other
folks
in
trouble
so
today
would
encourage
everybody
who
wants
to
help
to
visit
that
and
that
will
offer
you
links
to
that
are
working
on
the
ground
and
ways
that
you
can
support
their
efforts
our
friends
in
the
will
face
long
hard
road
ahead
but
continue
to
have
friend
and
partner
in
the
united
states
of
america
now
switching
gears
it
has
now
been
six
weeks
since
the
affordable
care
new
marketplace
has
opened
for
business
think
it
fair
to
say
that
the
has
been
rough
so
far
and
think
everybody
understands
that
not
happy
about
the
fact
that
the
has
been
wrought
with
whole
range
of
problems
that
been
deeply
concerned
about
but
today
want
to
talk
about
what
we
know
after
these
first
few
weeks
and
what
we
doing
to
implement
and
improve
the
law
yesterday
the
white
house
announced
that
in
the
first
month
more
than
americans
successfully
enrolled
in
new
insurance
plans
is
that
as
high
number
as
like
absolutely
not
but
it
does
mean
that
people
want
affordable
health
care
the
problems
of
the
website
have
prevented
too
many
americans
from
completing
the
process
and
on
us
not
on
them
but
there
is
no
question
that
real
demand
for
quality
affordable
health
insurance
in
the
first
month
nearly
million
people
successfully
completed
an
application
for
themselves
or
their
families
those
applications
represent
more
than
million
people
of
those
million
people
of
them
have
successfully
signed
up
to
get
covered
another
have
the
ability
to
gain
access
to
under
the
affordable
care
act
been
less
reported
on
but
it
be
americans
who
are
having
difficult
time
who
are
poor
many
of
them
working
may
have
disability
they
americans
like
everybody
else
and
the
fact
that
they
are
now
able
to
get
insurance
is
going
to
be
critically
important
later
today
be
in
ohio
where
governor
republican
has
expanded
under
the
affordable
care
act
and
as
many
as
will
ultimately
be
better
off
because
of
it
and
if
every
governor
followed
suit
another
million
americans
could
gain
access
to
health
care
next
year
so
bottom
line
is
in
just
one
month
despite
all
the
problems
that
we
seen
with
the
website
more
than
americans
could
know
the
security
of
health
care
by
january
many
of
them
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
and
and
it
significant
that
still
leaves
about
million
americans
who
successfully
made
it
through
the
website
and
now
qualify
to
buy
insurance
but
picked
plan
yet
and
no
question
that
if
the
website
were
working
as
supposed
to
that
number
would
be
much
higher
of
people
who
have
actually
enrolled
so
problem
number
one
making
sure
that
the
website
works
the
way
it
supposed
to
gotten
lot
better
over
the
last
few
weeks
than
it
was
on
the
first
day
but
working
to
get
it
working
for
the
vast
majority
of
americans
in
smooth
consistent
way
the
other
problem
that
has
received
lot
of
attention
concerns
americans
who
have
received
letters
from
their
insurers
that
they
may
be
losing
the
plans
they
bought
in
the
old
individual
market
often
because
they
no
longer
meet
the
requirements
to
cover
basic
benefits
like
prescription
drugs
or
visits
now
as
indicated
earlier
completely
get
how
upsetting
this
can
be
for
lot
of
americans
particularly
after
assurances
they
heard
from
me
that
if
they
had
plan
that
they
liked
they
could
keep
it
and
to
those
americans
hear
you
loud
and
clear
said
that
would
do
everything
we
can
to
fix
this
problem
and
today
offering
an
idea
that
will
help
do
it
already
people
who
have
plans
that
predate
the
affordable
care
act
can
keep
those
plans
if
they
changed
that
was
already
in
the
law
that
what
called
grandfather
clause
it
was
included
in
the
law
today
we
going
to
extend
that
principle
both
to
people
whose
plans
have
changed
since
the
law
took
effect
and
to
people
who
bought
plans
since
the
law
took
effect
so
state
insurance
commissioners
still
have
the
power
to
decide
what
plans
can
and
be
sold
in
their
states
but
the
bottom
line
is
insurers
can
extend
current
plans
that
would
otherwise
be
into
and
americans
whose
plans
have
been
can
choose
to
in
the
same
kind
of
plan
also
requiring
insurers
to
extend
current
plans
to
inform
their
customers
about
two
things
one
that
protections
what
protections
these
renewed
plans
include
and
number
two
that
the
marketplace
offers
new
options
with
better
coverage
and
tax
credits
that
might
help
you
bring
down
the
cost
so
if
received
one
of
these
letters
encourage
you
to
take
look
at
the
marketplace
even
if
the
website
working
as
smoothly
as
it
should
be
for
everybody
yet
the
plan
comparison
tool
that
lets
you
browse
costs
for
new
plans
near
you
is
working
just
fine
now
this
fix
solve
every
problem
for
every
person
but
going
to
help
lot
of
people
doing
more
will
require
work
with
congress
and
said
from
the
beginning
willing
to
work
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
fix
problems
as
they
arise
this
is
an
example
of
what
was
talking
about
we
can
always
make
this
law
work
better
it
is
important
to
understand
though
that
the
old
individual
market
was
not
working
well
and
important
that
we
pretend
that
somehow
place
worth
going
back
to
too
often
it
works
fine
as
long
as
you
stay
healthy
it
work
well
when
sick
so
year
after
year
americans
were
routinely
exposed
to
financial
ruin
or
denied
coverage
due
to
minor
conditions
or
dropped
from
coverage
altogether
even
if
they
paid
their
premiums
on
time
one
of
the
reasons
we
pursued
this
reform
in
the
first
place
and
why
will
not
accept
proposals
that
are
just
another
brazen
attempt
to
undermine
or
repeal
the
overall
law
and
drag
us
back
into
broken
system
we
will
continue
to
make
the
case
even
to
folks
who
choose
to
keep
their
own
plans
that
they
should
shop
around
in
the
new
marketplace
because
good
chance
that
be
able
to
buy
better
insurance
at
lower
cost
so
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
help
the
americans
who
have
received
these
cancellation
notices
but
also
want
everybody
to
remember
there
are
still
million
americans
who
have
health
insurance
at
all
not
going
to
walk
away
from
million
people
who
have
the
chance
to
get
health
insurance
for
the
first
time
and
not
going
to
walk
away
from
something
that
has
helped
the
cost
of
health
care
grow
at
its
slowest
rate
in
years
so
at
the
opening
weeks
of
the
project
to
build
better
health
care
system
for
everybody
system
that
will
offer
real
financial
security
and
peace
of
mind
to
millions
of
americans
it
is
complex
process
there
are
all
kinds
of
challenges
sure
there
will
be
additional
challenges
that
come
up
and
important
that
honest
and
straightforward
in
terms
of
when
we
come
up
with
problem
with
these
reforms
and
these
laws
that
we
address
them
but
got
to
move
forward
on
this
it
took
years
for
us
to
even
get
to
the
point
where
we
could
start
talking
about
and
implementing
law
to
make
sure
everybody
has
got
health
insurance
and
my
pledge
to
the
american
people
is
is
that
going
to
solve
the
problems
that
are
there
going
to
get
it
right
and
the
affordable
care
act
is
going
to
work
for
the
american
people
so
with
that
going
to
take
your
questions
and
going
to
start
with
pace
of
question
thank
you
president
the
combination
of
the
website
problems
and
the
concerns
over
the
policy
cancellations
has
sparked
lot
of
worry
within
your
own
party
and
polls
also
show
that
taking
some
hits
with
the
public
on
both
your
overall
job
approval
rating
and
also
on
factors
like
trust
and
honesty
do
you
feel
as
though
the
flawed
health
care
has
led
to
breach
in
the
public
trust
and
confidence
in
government
and
if
so
how
do
you
plan
to
resolve
that
president
there
is
no
doubt
that
people
are
frustrated
we
just
came
out
of
shutdown
and
the
possibility
that
for
the
first
time
in
over
years
we
pay
our
bills
and
people
breathed
sigh
of
relief
when
that
finally
got
done
and
the
next
thing
they
know
is
is
that
the
health
care
reform
get
the
website
to
work
and
that
there
are
these
other
problems
with
respect
to
cancellation
notices
and
understand
why
folks
are
frustrated
would
be
too
because
sometimes
people
look
at
taking
place
in
washington
and
they
say
not
enough
is
getting
done
that
helps
me
with
my
life
and
regardless
of
what
congress
does
ultimately
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
they
expect
me
to
do
something
about
it
so
in
terms
of
how
intend
to
approach
it
just
going
to
keep
on
working
as
hard
as
can
around
the
priorities
that
the
american
people
care
about
and
think
legitimate
for
them
to
expect
me
to
have
to
win
back
some
credibility
on
this
health
care
law
in
particular
and
on
whole
range
of
these
issues
in
general
and
on
me
mean
we
fumbled
the
on
this
health
care
law
there
are
whole
bunch
of
things
about
it
that
are
working
really
well
which
people
notice
because
they
controversial
so
making
sure
kids
could
stay
on
their
plans
until
they
were
through
the
age
of
and
making
sure
that
seniors
got
more
discounts
on
their
prescription
drugs
there
were
whole
bunch
of
stuff
that
we
did
well
over
the
first
three
years
but
we
always
knew
that
these
creating
place
where
people
can
shop
and
through
competition
get
better
deal
for
the
health
insurance
that
their
families
need
we
always
knew
that
that
was
going
to
be
complicated
and
everybody
was
going
to
be
paying
lot
of
attention
to
it
and
we
should
have
done
better
job
getting
that
right
on
day
one
not
on
day
or
on
day
am
confident
that
by
the
time
we
look
back
on
this
next
year
that
people
are
going
to
say
this
is
working
well
and
helping
lot
of
people
but
my
intention
in
terms
of
winning
back
the
confidence
of
the
american
people
is
just
to
work
as
hard
as
can
identify
the
problems
that
got
make
sure
that
fixing
them
whether
website
whether
it
is
making
sure
that
folks
who
got
these
cancellation
notices
get
help
just
going
to
keep
on
chipping
away
at
this
until
the
job
is
done
major
question
thank
you
president
you
said
while
the
law
was
being
debated
you
like
your
plan
you
can
keep
you
said
after
the
law
was
implemented
or
signed
you
like
your
plan
you
can
keep
americans
believed
you
sir
when
you
said
that
to
them
over
and
over
do
you
not
believe
sir
the
american
people
deserve
deeper
more
transparent
accountability
from
you
as
to
why
you
said
that
over
and
over
when
your
own
statistic
published
in
the
federal
register
alerted
your
policy
staff
and
presume
you
to
the
fact
that
millions
of
americans
would
in
fact
probably
fall
into
the
very
gap
trying
to
administratively
fix
now
that
one
question
second
question
laughter
you
were
informed
or
several
people
in
this
building
were
informed
two
weeks
before
the
launch
of
the
website
that
it
was
failing
the
most
basic
tests
internally
and
yet
decision
was
made
to
launch
the
website
on
october
did
you
sir
make
that
test
and
if
so
did
you
regret
that
president
okay
on
the
website
was
not
informed
directly
that
the
website
would
not
be
working
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
had
been
informed
be
going
out
saying
boy
this
is
going
to
be
great
accused
of
lot
of
things
but
do
think
stupid
enough
to
go
around
saying
this
is
going
to
be
like
shopping
on
amazon
or
week
before
the
website
opens
if
thought
that
it
going
to
work
so
clearly
we
and
did
not
have
enough
awareness
about
the
problems
in
the
website
even
week
into
it
the
thinking
was
that
these
were
some
that
would
be
fixed
with
patches
as
opposed
to
some
broader
systemic
problems
that
took
much
longer
to
fix
and
still
working
on
them
so
that
does
excuse
the
fact
that
they
just
do
work
but
think
fair
to
say
that
no
major
we
would
not
have
rolled
out
something
knowing
very
well
that
it
going
to
work
the
way
it
was
supposed
given
all
the
scrutiny
that
we
knew
was
going
to
be
on
the
website
with
respect
to
the
pledge
made
that
if
you
like
your
plan
you
can
keep
it
think
and
said
in
interviews
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
way
put
that
forward
unequivocally
ended
up
not
being
accurate
it
was
not
because
of
my
intention
not
to
deliver
on
that
commitment
and
that
promise
we
put
grandfather
clause
into
the
law
but
it
was
insufficient
keep
in
mind
that
the
individual
market
accounts
for
percent
of
the
population
so
when
said
you
can
keep
your
health
care
looking
at
folks
got
health
care
looking
at
folks
got
and
and
that
accounts
for
the
vast
majority
of
americans
and
then
for
people
who
do
have
any
health
insurance
at
all
obviously
that
did
apply
my
commitment
to
them
was
you
going
to
be
able
to
get
affordable
health
care
for
the
first
time
you
have
an
individual
market
that
accounts
for
about
percent
of
the
population
and
our
working
assumption
was
my
working
assumption
was
that
the
majority
of
those
folks
would
find
better
policies
at
lower
costs
or
the
same
costs
in
the
and
that
the
universe
of
folks
who
potentially
would
not
find
better
deal
in
the
the
grandfather
clause
would
work
sufficiently
for
them
and
it
did
and
again
that
on
us
which
is
why
that
on
me
and
that
why
trying
to
fix
it
and
as
said
earlier
guess
last
week
and
will
repeat
that
something
deeply
regret
because
scary
getting
cancellation
notice
now
it
is
important
to
understand
that
out
of
that
population
typically
there
is
constant
churn
in
that
market
this
market
is
not
very
stable
and
reliable
for
people
so
people
have
lot
of
complaints
when
they
in
that
marketplace
as
long
as
you
healthy
things
seem
to
be
going
pretty
good
and
so
lot
of
people
think
got
pretty
good
insurance
until
they
get
sick
and
then
suddenly
they
look
at
the
fine
print
and
got
expense
that
they
pay
we
know
that
on
average
over
the
last
decade
each
year
premiums
in
that
individual
market
would
go
up
an
average
of
percent
year
know
that
because
when
we
were
talking
about
health
care
reform
one
of
the
complaints
was
bought
health
care
in
the
individual
market
and
just
got
notice
from
the
insurer
they
dropped
me
after
had
an
illness
or
my
premium
by
or
percent
why
we
doing
something
about
this
so
part
of
what
our
goal
has
been
is
to
make
sure
that
that
individual
market
is
stable
and
fair
and
has
the
kind
of
consumer
protections
that
make
sure
that
people
get
rude
surprise
when
they
really
need
health
insurance
but
if
you
just
got
cancellation
notice
and
so
far
thinking
my
prices
are
pretty
good
you
been
sick
and
it
fits
your
budget
and
now
you
get
this
notice
going
to
be
worried
about
it
and
if
the
insurer
is
saying
the
reason
getting
this
notice
is
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
then
going
to
be
understandably
aggravated
about
it
now
for
big
portion
of
those
people
the
truth
is
they
might
have
gotten
notice
saying
jacking
up
your
rates
by
percent
they
might
have
said
from
here
on
out
not
going
to
cover
and
illnesses
changing
the
because
these
were
all
policies
the
insurance
companies
were
under
no
obligation
to
renew
the
exact
same
policies
that
you
had
before
but
look
one
of
the
things
understood
when
we
decided
to
reform
that
health
insurance
market
part
of
the
reason
why
it
been
done
before
and
very
difficult
to
do
is
that
anything
going
on
tough
in
the
health
care
market
if
you
initiated
reform
can
be
attributed
to
your
law
and
so
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
be
able
to
say
to
these
folks
you
know
what
the
affordable
care
act
is
not
going
to
be
the
reason
why
insurers
have
to
cancel
your
plan
now
what
folks
may
find
is
the
insurance
companies
may
still
come
back
and
say
we
want
to
charge
you
percent
more
than
we
did
last
year
or
not
going
to
cover
prescription
drugs
now
but
in
the
nature
of
the
market
that
existed
earlier
question
did
you
decide
sir
that
the
simple
declaration
was
something
the
american
people
could
handle
but
this
answer
you
just
gave
now
was
something
that
you
handle
and
you
trust
the
american
people
with
fuller
truth
president
no
think
as
said
earlier
major
my
expectation
was
that
for
percent
of
the
american
people
either
it
genuinely
would
change
at
all
or
they
be
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
options
in
the
marketplace
and
that
the
grandfather
clause
would
cover
the
rest
that
proved
not
to
be
the
case
and
that
on
me
and
the
american
people
those
who
got
cancellation
notices
do
deserve
and
have
received
an
apology
from
me
but
they
do
want
just
words
what
they
want
is
whether
we
can
make
sure
that
they
are
in
better
place
and
that
we
meet
that
commitment
and
by
the
way
think
it
very
important
for
me
to
note
that
there
are
whole
bunch
of
folks
up
in
congress
and
others
who
made
this
statement
and
they
were
entirely
sincere
about
it
and
the
fact
that
you
got
this
percentage
of
people
who
have
had
this
impact
want
them
to
know
that
their
senator
or
congressman
they
were
making
representations
based
on
what
told
them
and
what
this
white
house
and
our
administrative
staff
told
them
and
so
it
not
on
them
it
on
us
but
it
is
something
that
we
intend
to
fix
question
do
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
iran
would
walk
away
from
nuclear
talks
if
congress
draws
up
new
sanctions
and
would
diplomatic
breakdown
at
this
stage
leave
you
no
option
but
military
action
and
how
do
you
respond
to
your
critics
on
the
hill
who
say
that
it
was
only
tough
sanctions
that
got
iran
to
the
table
but
only
tougher
sanctions
will
make
it
capitulate
president
well
let
me
make
couple
of
points
number
one
said
before
and
will
repeat
we
do
not
want
iran
having
nuclear
weapons
and
it
would
be
not
only
dangerous
to
us
and
our
allies
but
it
would
be
to
the
entire
region
and
could
trigger
nuclear
arms
race
that
would
make
life
much
more
dangerous
for
all
of
us
so
our
policy
is
iran
can
not
have
nuclear
weapons
and
leaving
all
options
on
the
table
to
make
sure
that
we
meet
that
goal
point
number
two
the
reason
we
got
such
vigorous
sanctions
is
because
and
my
administration
put
in
place
when
came
into
office
the
international
structure
to
have
the
most
effective
sanctions
ever
and
so
think
it
fair
to
say
that
know
little
bit
about
sanctions
since
we
set
them
up
and
made
sure
that
we
the
entire
international
community
so
that
there
were
lot
of
loopholes
and
they
really
had
bite
and
the
intention
in
setting
up
those
sanctions
always
was
to
bring
the
iranians
to
the
table
so
that
we
could
resolve
this
issue
peacefully
because
that
is
my
preference
that
my
preference
because
any
armed
conflict
has
cost
to
it
but
it
also
my
preference
because
the
best
way
to
assure
that
country
does
not
have
nuclear
weapons
is
that
they
are
making
decision
not
to
have
nuclear
weapons
and
we
in
position
to
verify
that
they
do
have
nuclear
weapons
so
as
consequence
of
the
sanctions
that
we
put
in
place
and
appreciate
all
the
help
bipartisan
help
that
we
received
from
congress
in
making
that
happen
iran
economy
has
been
crippled
they
had
percent
growth
rate
last
year
their
currency
plummeted
they
having
significant
problems
in
just
the
economy
on
the
ground
in
iran
and
president
made
decision
that
he
was
prepared
to
come
and
have
conversation
with
the
international
community
about
what
they
could
do
to
solve
this
problem
with
us
we
now
had
series
of
conversations
and
it
has
never
been
realistic
that
we
would
resolve
the
entire
problem
all
at
once
what
we
have
done
is
seen
the
possibility
of
an
agreement
in
which
iran
would
halt
advances
on
its
program
that
it
would
dilute
some
of
the
highly
enriched
uranium
that
makes
it
easier
for
them
to
potentially
produce
weapon
that
they
are
subjecting
themselves
to
much
more
vigorous
inspections
so
that
we
know
exactly
what
doing
at
all
their
various
facilities
and
that
that
would
then
provide
time
and
space
for
us
to
test
over
certain
period
of
months
whether
or
not
they
are
prepared
to
actually
resolve
this
issue
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
international
community
making
us
confident
that
in
fact
not
pursuing
nuclear
weapons
program
in
return
the
basic
structure
of
been
talked
about
although
not
completed
is
that
we
would
provide
very
modest
relief
at
the
margins
of
the
sanctions
that
set
up
but
importantly
we
would
leave
in
place
the
core
sanctions
that
are
most
effective
and
have
most
impact
on
the
iranian
economy
specifically
oil
sanctions
and
sanctions
with
respect
to
banks
and
financing
and
what
that
gives
us
is
the
opportunity
to
test
how
serious
are
they
but
it
also
gives
us
an
assurance
that
if
it
turns
out
six
months
from
now
that
not
serious
we
can
crank
we
can
dial
those
sanctions
right
back
up
so
my
message
to
congress
has
been
that
see
if
this
deal
can
be
completed
to
our
satisfaction
where
absolutely
certain
that
while
talking
with
the
iranians
not
busy
advancing
their
program
we
can
buy
some
additional
months
in
terms
of
their
breakout
capacity
test
how
willing
they
are
to
actually
resolve
this
diplomatically
and
peacefully
we
will
have
lost
nothing
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
turns
out
that
they
are
not
prepared
to
provide
the
international
community
the
hard
proof
and
assurances
necessary
for
us
to
know
that
not
pursuing
nuclear
weapon
and
if
that
turns
out
to
be
the
case
then
not
only
is
our
entire
sanctions
infrastructure
still
in
place
not
only
are
they
still
losing
money
from
the
fact
that
they
sell
their
oil
and
get
revenue
from
their
oil
as
easily
even
throughout
these
talks
but
other
options
remain
but
what
said
to
members
of
congress
is
that
if
in
fact
serious
about
trying
to
resolve
this
diplomatically
because
no
matter
how
good
our
military
is
military
options
are
always
messy
always
difficult
always
have
unintended
consequences
and
in
this
situation
are
never
complete
in
terms
of
making
us
certain
that
they
then
go
out
and
pursue
even
more
vigorously
nuclear
weapons
in
the
future
if
serious
about
pursuing
diplomacy
then
no
need
for
us
to
add
new
sanctions
on
top
of
the
sanctions
that
are
already
very
effective
and
that
brought
them
to
the
table
in
the
first
place
now
if
it
turns
out
they
deliver
they
come
to
the
table
in
serious
way
and
get
this
issue
resolved
the
sanctions
can
be
ramped
back
up
and
got
that
option
all
right
his
birthday
by
the
way
so
not
the
reason
you
got
question
but
thought
it
was
important
to
note
that
question
thank
you
president
president
happy
birthday
question
back
to
health
care
can
you
guarantee
for
the
american
people
that
the
health
care
website
is
going
to
be
fully
operational
for
all
people
not
just
the
vast
majority
by
november
and
second
more
broadly
this
is
your
signature
domestic
piece
of
legislation
you
hear
criticism
on
the
hill
that
you
and
your
white
house
team
are
too
insular
is
that
how
this
mess
came
to
be
president
well
think
there
is
going
to
be
lot
of
evaluation
of
how
we
got
to
this
point
and
assure
you
that
been
asking
lot
of
questions
about
that
the
truth
is
that
this
is
number
one
very
complicated
the
website
itself
is
doing
lot
of
stuff
there
lot
of
out
there
that
have
to
help
people
compare
their
possible
insurance
options
verify
income
to
find
out
what
kind
of
tax
credits
they
might
get
communicate
with
those
insurance
companies
so
they
can
purchase
make
sure
that
all
of
verified
so
just
bunch
of
pieces
to
it
that
made
it
challenging
and
you
combine
that
with
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
does
lot
of
things
really
well
one
of
the
things
it
does
not
do
well
is
information
technology
procurement
this
is
kind
of
systematic
problem
that
we
have
across
the
board
and
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
there
were
going
to
be
some
problems
now
think
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
some
hard
questions
inside
the
white
house
as
opposed
to
why
we
did
see
more
of
these
problems
coming
earlier
on
so
we
could
set
expectations
so
that
we
could
look
for
different
ways
for
people
to
end
up
applying
so
ultimately
right
this
is
something
that
really
important
to
me
and
really
important
to
millions
of
americans
who
have
been
waiting
for
really
long
time
to
try
to
get
health
care
because
they
do
have
it
and
am
very
frustrated
but
also
somebody
who
if
fumbled
the
ball
going
to
wait
until
get
the
next
play
and
then
going
to
try
to
run
as
hard
as
can
and
do
right
by
the
team
so
ultimately
the
head
of
this
team
we
did
fumble
the
ball
on
it
and
what
going
to
do
is
make
sure
that
we
get
it
fixed
in
terms
of
what
happens
on
november
or
december
think
fair
to
say
that
the
improvement
will
be
marked
and
noticeable
the
website
will
work
much
better
on
november
december
than
it
worked
certainly
on
october
that
pretty
low
bar
it
will
be
working
lot
better
than
it
is
it
was
last
week
and
it
will
be
working
better
than
it
was
this
week
which
means
that
the
majority
of
people
who
go
to
the
website
will
see
website
that
is
working
the
way
supposed
to
think
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
guarantee
that
percent
of
the
people
percent
of
the
time
going
on
this
website
will
have
perfectly
seamless
smooth
experience
going
to
have
to
continue
to
improve
it
even
after
november
december
but
the
majority
of
people
who
use
it
will
be
able
to
see
it
operate
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
one
thing
that
discovered
though
that
think
is
worth
noting
lot
of
focus
has
been
on
the
website
and
the
technology
and
that
partly
because
that
how
we
initially
identified
it
these
are
what
discovering
is
that
part
of
the
problem
has
been
technology
hardware
and
software
and
that
being
upgraded
but
even
if
we
get
the
hardware
and
software
working
exactly
the
way
supposed
to
with
relatively
minor
what
also
discovering
is
that
insurance
is
complicated
to
buy
and
another
mistake
that
we
made
think
was
underestimating
the
difficulties
of
people
purchasing
insurance
and
shopping
for
lot
of
options
with
lot
of
costs
and
lot
of
different
benefits
and
plans
and
somehow
expecting
that
that
would
be
very
smooth
and
then
also
got
to
try
apply
for
tax
credits
on
the
website
so
what
doing
even
as
trying
to
solve
the
technical
problems
is
also
what
can
we
do
to
make
the
application
little
bit
simpler
what
can
we
do
to
make
it
in
english
as
opposed
to
are
there
steps
that
we
can
skip
while
still
getting
the
core
information
that
people
need
and
part
of
what
is
that
they
are
going
to
be
certain
portion
of
people
who
are
just
going
to
need
more
help
and
more
in
the
application
process
and
so
guess
part
of
the
continuous
improvement
that
looking
at
is
not
just
technical
issue
also
can
we
streamline
the
application
process
what
are
we
doing
to
give
people
more
assistance
in
the
application
process
how
do
the
call
and
the
people
who
are
helping
folks
how
are
they
trained
so
that
things
can
go
more
smoothly
because
the
bottom
line
ultimately
is
just
want
people
to
know
what
their
options
are
in
clear
way
and
buying
health
insurance
is
never
going
to
be
like
buying
song
on
just
much
more
complicated
transaction
but
think
we
can
continue
to
make
it
better
all
of
which
is
to
say
that
on
december
november
it
will
be
lot
better
but
there
will
still
be
some
problems
some
of
those
will
not
be
because
of
technological
problems
although
sure
that
there
will
still
be
some
that
have
to
be
smoothed
out
some
of
going
to
be
how
are
we
making
this
application
process
more
for
folks
and
one
good
example
of
this
by
the
way
just
to
use
an
analogy
when
we
came
into
office
we
heard
lot
of
complaints
about
the
financial
aid
forms
that
families
have
to
fill
out
to
get
federal
financial
aid
and
actually
remember
applying
for
some
of
that
stuff
and
remember
how
difficult
and
confusing
it
was
and
over
at
education
worked
with
team
to
see
what
we
could
do
to
simplify
it
and
it
made
big
difference
and
that
part
of
the
process
that
got
to
go
through
and
in
fact
if
we
can
get
some
focus
groups
and
we
sit
down
with
actual
users
and
see
how
well
is
this
working
what
would
improve
it
what
part
of
it
did
you
understand
that
all
think
is
part
of
what
going
to
be
working
on
in
the
weeks
ahead
question
what
about
the
insularity
criticism
that
you
hear
on
the
hill
president
got
to
say
meet
with
an
awful
lot
of
folks
and
talk
to
an
awful
lot
of
folks
every
day
and
have
lunches
with
and
it
venture
capitalists
and
leaders
and
pretty
much
folks
from
all
walks
of
life
on
whole
bunch
of
topics
and
if
you
looked
at
my
schedule
on
any
given
day
interacting
with
whole
lot
of
people
and
think
fair
to
say
that
we
have
pretty
good
track
record
of
working
with
folks
on
technology
and
it
from
our
campaign
where
both
in
and
we
did
pretty
darn
good
job
on
that
so
not
the
idea
that
somehow
we
did
have
access
or
were
interested
in
ideas
think
accurate
what
is
true
is
that
as
said
before
our
it
systems
how
we
purchase
technology
in
the
federal
government
is
cumbersome
complicated
and
outdated
and
so
this
situation
where
on
my
campaign
could
simply
say
who
are
the
best
folks
out
there
get
them
around
table
figure
out
what
doing
and
just
going
to
continue
to
improve
it
and
refine
it
and
work
on
our
goals
if
you
doing
it
at
the
federal
government
level
you
going
through
pages
of
specs
and
this
and
that
and
the
other
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
laws
involved
and
it
makes
it
more
difficult
it
part
of
the
reason
why
chronically
federal
it
programs
are
over
budget
behind
schedule
and
one
of
the
when
do
some
monday
morning
on
myself
one
of
the
things
that
do
is
since
know
that
the
federal
government
has
not
been
good
at
this
stuff
in
the
past
two
years
ago
as
we
were
thinking
about
this
we
might
have
done
more
to
make
sure
that
we
were
breaking
the
mold
on
how
we
were
going
to
be
setting
this
up
but
that
does
help
us
now
we
got
to
move
forward
mason
question
thank
you
president
today
fix
that
you
just
announced
leaves
it
up
to
state
insurance
commissioners
and
insurance
companies
to
ultimately
decide
whether
to
allow
old
policies
to
be
renewed
for
year
how
confident
are
you
that
they
will
do
that
and
secondly
how
concerned
are
you
that
this
flawed
may
hurt
democrats
chances
in
next
year
elections
and
your
ability
to
advance
other
priorities
such
as
immigration
reform
president
on
the
first
question
traditionally
state
insurance
commissioners
make
decisions
about
what
plans
can
be
or
can
not
be
sold
how
they
interact
with
insurers
what
we
essentially
saying
is
the
affordable
care
act
is
not
going
to
be
the
factor
in
what
happens
with
folks
in
the
individual
market
and
my
guess
is
right
away
you
going
to
see
number
of
state
insurance
commissioners
exercise
it
part
of
the
challenge
is
the
individual
markets
are
different
in
different
states
there
are
some
states
that
have
individual
insurance
markets
that
already
have
almost
all
the
consumer
protections
that
the
affordable
care
act
does
they
match
up
pretty
good
it
not
some
big
jump
for
folks
to
move
into
the
marketplace
in
others
they
pretty
low
standards
so
you
can
sell
pretty
substandard
plans
in
those
markets
and
that
where
people
might
see
bigger
jump
in
their
premiums
so
think
there
going
to
be
some
evaluation
on
how
this
is
handled
but
the
key
point
is
is
that
it
allows
us
to
be
able
to
say
to
the
folks
who
received
these
notices
look
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
insurance
that
the
insurance
model
the
affordable
care
act
is
not
going
to
be
getting
in
the
way
of
you
shopping
in
the
individual
market
that
you
used
to
have
as
said
there
are
still
going
to
be
some
folks
who
over
time
think
are
going
to
find
that
the
are
better
one
way
described
this
to
met
with
group
of
senators
when
this
issue
first
came
up
and
it
not
perfect
analogy
but
we
made
decision
as
society
that
every
car
has
to
have
or
and
so
you
pass
regulation
and
there
are
some
additional
costs
particularly
at
the
start
of
increasing
the
safety
and
protections
but
we
make
decision
as
society
that
the
costs
are
outweighed
by
the
benefits
of
all
the
lives
that
are
saved
so
what
we
saying
now
is
if
you
buying
new
car
you
got
to
have
well
the
problem
with
the
grandfather
clause
that
we
put
in
place
is
it
almost
like
we
said
to
folks
you
got
to
buy
new
car
even
if
you
afford
it
right
now
and
sooner
or
later
folks
are
going
to
start
trading
in
their
old
cars
but
we
do
need
if
their
life
circumstance
is
such
where
for
now
at
least
they
want
to
keep
the
old
car
even
if
the
new
car
is
better
we
should
be
able
to
give
them
that
option
and
that
what
we
want
to
do
and
by
the
way
that
what
we
should
have
been
able
to
do
in
drafting
the
rules
in
the
first
place
so
again
these
are
two
fumbles
on
something
that
on
big
game
which
but
the
game
is
not
over
with
respect
to
the
politics
of
it
let
you
guys
do
lot
of
the
work
on
projecting
what
this
means
for
various
political
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
failure
to
roll
out
the
smoothly
has
put
burden
on
democrats
whether
they
running
or
not
because
they
stood
up
and
supported
this
effort
through
thick
and
thin
and
feel
deeply
responsible
for
making
it
harder
for
them
rather
than
easier
for
them
to
continue
to
promote
the
core
values
that
think
led
them
to
support
this
thing
in
the
first
place
which
is
in
this
country
as
wealthy
as
we
are
everybody
should
be
able
to
have
the
security
of
affordable
health
care
and
that
why
feel
so
strongly
about
fixing
it
my
first
and
foremost
obligation
is
the
american
people
to
make
sure
that
they
can
get
what
there
if
we
can
just
get
the
darn
website
working
and
smooth
this
thing
out
which
is
plans
that
are
affordable
and
allow
them
to
take
advantage
of
tax
credits
and
give
them
better
deal
but
also
do
feel
an
obligation
to
everybody
out
there
who
supported
this
effort
when
we
do
do
good
job
on
the
we
letting
them
down
and
do
like
doing
that
so
my
commitment
to
them
is
we
going
to
just
keep
on
doing
better
every
day
until
we
get
it
done
and
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
me
think
to
some
extent
addressed
it
when
talked
to
there
are
going
to
be
ups
and
downs
during
the
course
of
my
presidency
and
think
said
early
on
when
was
running
am
not
perfect
man
and
will
not
be
perfect
president
but
wake
up
every
single
day
working
as
hard
as
can
on
behalf
of
americans
out
there
from
every
walk
of
life
who
are
working
hard
meeting
their
responsibilities
but
sometimes
are
struggling
because
the
way
the
system
works
is
giving
them
fair
shot
and
that
pledge
have
broke
that
commitment
that
promise
continues
to
be
continues
to
hold
the
promise
that
would
be
perfect
number
one
but
also
the
promise
that
as
long
as
got
the
of
having
this
office
just
going
to
work
as
hard
as
can
to
make
things
better
for
folks
and
what
that
means
specifically
in
this
health
care
arena
is
we
go
back
to
the
status
mean
right
now
everybody
is
properly
focused
on
us
not
doing
good
job
on
the
and
legitimate
and
get
it
there
have
been
times
where
thought
we
were
kind
of
slapped
around
little
bit
unjustly
this
one
is
deserved
right
on
us
but
we
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
status
before
the
affordable
care
act
was
not
working
at
all
if
the
health
care
system
had
been
working
fine
and
everybody
had
health
insurance
at
affordable
prices
have
made
it
priority
we
have
been
fighting
this
hard
to
get
it
done
which
is
why
when
see
sometimes
folks
up
on
capitol
hill
and
republicans
in
particular
who
have
been
suggesting
repeal
repeal
get
rid
of
this
thing
keep
on
asking
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
do
are
you
suggesting
that
the
status
was
working
because
it
and
everybody
knows
it
it
working
in
the
individual
market
and
it
certainly
working
for
the
million
people
who
have
health
insurance
and
so
what
we
did
was
we
chose
path
that
was
the
least
disruptive
to
try
to
finally
make
sure
that
health
care
is
treated
in
this
country
like
it
is
in
every
other
advanced
country
that
not
some
privilege
that
just
certain
portion
of
people
can
have
but
something
that
everybody
has
some
confidence
about
and
we
go
far
left
and
choose
an
approach
that
would
have
been
much
more
disruptive
we
adopt
some
more
conservative
proposals
that
would
have
been
much
more
disruptive
we
tried
to
choose
way
that
built
off
the
existing
system
but
it
is
complicated
it
is
hard
but
make
no
apologies
for
us
taking
this
on
because
somebody
sooner
or
later
had
to
do
it
do
make
apologies
for
not
having
executed
better
over
the
last
several
months
question
and
do
you
think
that
execution
and
the
flaws
in
the
will
affect
your
ability
to
do
other
things
like
immigration
reform
and
other
policy
priorities
president
well
look
if
it
comes
to
immigration
reform
there
is
no
reason
for
us
not
to
do
immigration
reform
and
already
got
strong
bipartisan
support
for
immigration
reform
out
of
the
senate
got
met
with
number
of
traditionally
very
conservative
clergy
who
are
deeply
committed
to
immigration
reform
got
the
business
community
entirely
behind
immigration
reform
so
got
bunch
of
constituencies
that
are
traditionally
much
more
have
leaned
much
more
heavily
towards
the
republicans
who
are
behind
this
so
if
people
are
looking
for
an
excuse
not
to
do
the
right
thing
on
immigration
reform
they
can
always
find
an
excuse
run
out
of
time
or
this
is
hard
or
the
list
goes
on
and
on
but
my
working
assumption
is
people
should
want
to
do
the
right
thing
and
when
got
an
issue
that
would
strengthen
borders
make
sure
that
the
legal
immigration
system
works
the
way
supposed
to
that
would
go
after
employers
who
have
been
doing
the
wrong
thing
when
it
comes
to
hiring
undocumented
workers
and
would
allow
folks
who
are
here
illegally
to
get
right
with
the
law
and
pay
fine
and
learn
english
and
get
to
the
back
of
the
line
but
ultimately
join
fully
our
american
community
when
got
law
that
makes
sense
you
be
looking
for
an
excuse
not
to
do
it
and
going
to
keep
on
pushing
to
make
sure
it
gets
done
am
going
to
have
to
do
some
work
to
rebuild
confidence
around
some
of
our
initiatives
yes
but
part
of
this
job
is
the
things
that
go
right
you
guys
going
to
write
about
the
things
that
go
wrong
get
prominent
attention
how
it
has
always
been
not
unique
to
me
as
president
and
up
to
the
challenge
going
to
get
this
done
all
right
thank
you
everybody
good
morning
everyone
thank
you
secretary
for
your
lifetime
of
service
to
our
nation
and
for
being
tireless
advocate

behalf
of
america

including
your
fellow
veterans
to
vice
president
and
secretaries
and
admiral
major
general
most
of
all

our
outstanding
veteran
service

men
and
women
in
uniform
and

the
proud
veterans
and
family
members

us
in
this
sacred
place
and
are
incredibly
to
be
with
you

here
today
again
to
the
gold
star
families
and
the

paths
of
these
hallowed
grounds
and
the
cemeteries
around
the
world
we
join
you
as
you

your
loved
ones
who
wore
america
uniform
and
here
at
and
section
we
ensured
that
you
can
continue
to
bring
the
small
of
your
love
and
affection
to
the
final
resting
place
of
these
american
today
we
gather
once
more
to
patriots
who
have
rendered
the
highest
service
any
american
can
offer
this
nation
those
who
fought
for
our
freedom
and
stood
sentry
for
our
security
on
this
hillside
of
solemn
remembrance
and
in
veterans
halls
and
in
proud
parades
across
america
we
join
as
one
people
to
debt
we
can
never
fully
repay
in
the
life
of
our
nation
across
every
generation
there
are
those
who
stand
apart
they
step
up
they
raise
their
hands
they
take
that
oath
they
put
on
the
uniform
and
they
put
their
lives
on
the
line
they
do
this
so
that
the
rest
of
us
might
live
in
country
and
world
that
is
safer
freer
and
more
just
this
is
the
gift
they
given
us
this
is
the
debt
that
we
owe
them
they
fought
on
green
at
so
that
we
could
make
independent
the
country
they
imagined
they
fought
on
the
fields
of
so
that
we
could
make
whole
nation
torn
asunder
they
fought
on
the
beaches
of
europe
and
across
pacific
islands
and
from
their
sacrifice
we
emerged
the
strongest
and
most
prosperous
nation
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
this
year
as
we
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
end
of
the
fighting
in
korea
we
pay
special
tribute
to
all
those
who
served
in
the
korean
war
from
the
jungles
of
to
desert
storm
to
the
mountains
of
the
they
have
answered
america
call
and
since
america
was
attacked
on
that
clear
september
morning
millions
more
have
assumed
that
mantle
defining
one
of
the
greatest
generations
of
military
service
this
country
has
ever
produced
on
tour
after
tour
after
tour
in
iraq
and
this
generation
the
generation
has
met
every
mission
we
have
asked
of
them
and
today
we
can
say
that
because
of
their
heroic
service
the
core
of
is
on
the
path
to
defeat
our
nation
is
more
secure
and
our
homeland
is
safer
they
men
and
women
like
the
soldier
and
soon
to
be
veteran
met
few
months
ago
deployed
to
iraq
twice
and
she
survived
not
one
but
two
excuse
me
three
separate
explosions
and
when
she
was
well
enough
she
deployed
again
this
time
to
where
she
was
often
the
only
woman
at
our
forward
operating
bases
she
proudly
wears
the
combat
action
badge
and
today
is
committed
to
helping
other
wounded
warriors
recover
from
the
trials
of
war
helping
the
troops
she
says
is
what
all
about
my
fellow
americans
that
what
we
should
be
all
about
our
work
is
more
urgent
than
ever
because
this
chapter
of
war
is
coming
to
an
end
soon
one
of
the
first
marines
to
arrive
in
years
ago
brigadier
general
daniel
will
lead
his
camp
marines
as
they
become
one
of
the
last
major
groups
of
marines
to
deploy
in
this
war
and
over
the
coming
months
more
of
our
troops
will
come
home
this
winter
our
troop
levels
in
will
be
down
to
and
by
this
time
next
year
the
transition
to
security
will
be
nearly
complete
the
longest
war
in
american
history
will
end
as
is
true
after
every
conflict
there
is
risk
that
the
devoted
service
of
our
veterans
could
fade
from
the
forefront
of
our
minds
that
we
might
turn
to
other
things
but
part
of
the
reason
we
here
today
is
to
pledge
that
we
will
never
forget
the
profound
sacrifices
that
are
made
in
our
name
today
reminds
us
of
our
sacred
obligations
for
even
though
this
time
of
war
is
coming
to
close
our
time
of
service
to
our
newest
veterans
has
only
just
begun
think
about
it
our
troops
wear
the
uniform
for
time
yet
they
wear
another
proud
title
the
title
of
veteran
for
decades
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
as
nation
we
make
sure
we
have
the
military
in
the
world
we
have
to
devote
just
as
much
energy
and
passion
to
making
sure
we
have
the
for
veterans
in
the
world
so
when
we
talk
about
fulfilling
our
promises
to
our
veterans
we
do
just
mean
for
few
years
we
mean
now
tomorrow
and
forever
and
not
just
for
generations
past
but
for
this
generation
of
veterans
and
all
who
will
follow
and
that
why
as
going
to
keep
making
sure
we
providing
unprecedented
support
to
our
veterans
even
as
we
make
difficult
fiscal
choices
as
nation
we
going
to
keep
making
vital
investments
in
our
veterans
we
going
to
keep
improving
veterans
health
care
including
mental
health
care
so
you
can
stay
strong

sure
that
veterans
not
covered
by
the
can
secure
quality
affordable
health
insurance
we
going
to
keep
reducing
the
claims
backlog
we
slashed
it
by
third
since
march
and
we
going
to
keep
at
it
so
you
can
get
the
benefits
that
you
have
earned
and
that
you
need
when
you
need
them
we
going
to
keep
helping
our
newest
veterans
and
their
families
pursue
their
education
under
the
bill
we
just
welcomed
our
one
millionth
student
veteran
and
we
ready
for
all
those
who
come
next
and
we
going
to
keep
demanding
that
the
rights
and
dignity
of
every
veteran
are
upheld
including
by
pushing
for
the
disabilities
treaty
so
that
our
disabled
veterans
enjoy
the
same
opportunities
to
travel
and
work
and
study
around
the
world
as
everybody
else
and
with
the
help
of
and
and
joining
forces
we
going
to
keep
fighting
to
give
every
veteran
who
has
fought
for
america
the
chance
to
pursue
the
american
dream
fair
shot
at
the
jobs
and
opportunity
you
need
to
help
us
rebuild
and
grow
here
at
home
because
you
bringing
home
the
skills
and
the
work
ethic
and
leadership
necessary
to
start
companies
and
serve
your
communities
and
take
care
of
your
fellow
veterans
and
that
our
promise
to
you
and
all
who
have
served
to
be
there
to
support
you
when
you
come
home
every
step
of
the
way
and
as
nation
we
will
strive
to
be
worthy
of
the
sacrifices
that
you
made
that
what
we
owe
all
our
veterans
that
what
we
owe
veterans
like
who
served
in
the
army
in
world
war
he
was
there
at
now
everybody
want
you
to
know
little
something
about
here
he
was
there
at
pearl
when
the
battleships
were
still
he
was
there
at
he
was
there
at
where
he
said
only
got
out
of
there
by
the
grace
of
god
when
the
war
ended
headed
home
to
texas
to
nation
bitterly
divided
by
race
and
his
service
on
the
battlefield
was
not
always
matched
by
the
respect
that
he
deserved
at
home
but
this
veteran
held
his
head
high
he
carried
on
and
lived
his
life
with
and
dignity
he
built
his
wife
house
with
his
own
two
hands
he
went
back
to
work
in
the
furniture
business
in
time
he
served
as
courier
in
the
texas
state
capitol
where
he
worked
for
four
governors
and
made
more
friends
than
most
of
us
do
in
lifetime
and
today
still
lives
in
the
house
that
he
built
all
those
years
ago
he
rakes
his
own
lawn
and
every
sunday
he
hops
in
his
ford
truck
and
drives
one
of
the
nice
ladies
in
his
to
church
this
is
the
life
of
one
american
veteran
living
proud
and
strong
in
the
land
he
helped
keep
free
and
earlier
this
year
the
great
folks
at
flight
brought
to
washington
for
the
first
time
and
he
and
his
fellow
veterans
paid
their
respects
at
the
world
war
memorial
and
then
they
visited
the
memorial
to
martin
luther
king
and
as
sat
in
wheelchair
beneath
that
great
marble
statue
he
wept
and
the
crowd
that
gathered
around
him
wept
too
to
see
one
of
the
oldest
living
veterans
of
world
war
bear
witness
to
day
to
the
progress
of
nation
he
thought
might
never
come
this
american
veteran
is
years
old
and
we
are
that
he
here
with
us
today
so
let
ask
to
stand
again
because
he
can
stand
and
this
is
how
we
be
judged
not
just
by
how
well
we
care
for
our
troops
in
battle
but
how
we
treat
them
when
they
come
home
and
by
the
america
we
build
together
by
what
we
do
with
the
security
and
peace
that
they
have
helped
grant
us
by
the
progress
that
allows
citizens
from
to
to
play
their
part
in
the
american
story
today
our
message
to
all
those
who
have
ever
worn
the
uniform
of
this
nation
is
this
we
will
stand
by
your
side
whether
you
seven
days
out
or
like
seventy
years
out
because
here
in
america
we
take
care
of
our
own
we
the
sacrifice
that
has
been
made
in
our
name
for
this
nation
that
we
love
and
we
commit
ourselves
to
standing
by
these
veterans
and
their
families
for
as
long
as
we
blessed
to
walk
this
earth
god

states
of
america
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
everybody
well
thank
you
and
thanks
to
everybody
here
for
coming
on
this
beautiful
day
welcome
to
the
white
house
about
three
weeks
ago
as
the
federal
government
shut
down
the
affordable
care
health
insurance
opened
for
business
across
the
country
well
now
gotten
the
government
back
open
for
the
american
people
and
today
want
to
talk
about
how
going
to
get
the
running
at
full
steam
as
well
and
joined
today
by
folks
who
have
either
benefited
from
the
affordable
care
act
already
or
who
are
helping
their
fellow
citizens
learn
about
what
this
law
means
for
them
and
how
they
can
get
covered
of
course
probably
heard
that
the
new
website
where
people
can
apply
for
health
insurance
and
browse
and
buy
affordable
plans
in
most
states
has
worked
as
smoothly
as
it
was
supposed
to
work
and
the
number
of
people
who
have
visited
the
site
has
been
overwhelming
which
has
aggravated
some
of
these
underlying
problems
despite
all
that
thousands
of
people
are
signing
up
and
saving
money
as
we
speak
many
americans
with
condition
like
are
discovering
that
they
can
finally
get
health
insurance
like
everybody
else
so
today
want
to
speak
to
every
american
looking
to
get
affordable
health
insurance
want
you
to
know
available
to
you
and
why
it
may
be
good
deal
for
you
and
for
those
had
some
problems
with
the
website
want
to
tell
you
what
doing
to
make
it
work
better
and
how
you
can
sign
up
to
get
covered
in
other
ways
but
before
do
that
let
me
remind
everybody
that
the
affordable
care
act
is
not
just
website
it
much
more
for
the
vast
majority
of
americans
for
percent
of
americans
who
already
have
health
insurance
through
your
employer
or
or
you
need
to
sign
up
for
coverage
through
website
at
all
you
already
got
coverage
what
the
affordable
care
act
does
for
you
is
to
provide
you
with
new
benefits
and
protections
that
have
been
in
place
for
some
time
you
may
not
know
it
but
you
already
benefiting
from
these
provisions
in
the
law
for
example
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
young
people
like
jasmine
and
and
all
of
whom
are
here
today
been
able
to
stay
on
their
plans
until
millions
of
other
young
people
are
currently
benefiting
from
that
part
of
the
law
another
part
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
providing
seniors
with
deeper
discounts
on
their
prescription
medicine
billions
of
dollars
have
been
saved
by
seniors
already
part
of
the
law
already
in
place
happening
right
now
already
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
preventive
care
like
and
birth
control
are
free
through
your
employers
part
of
this
law
so
there
are
wide
range
of
consumer
protections
and
benefits
that
you
already
have
if
got
health
insurance
you
may
not
have
noticed
them
but
got
them
and
not
going
anywhere
and
not
dependent
on
website
another
thing
that
the
affordable
care
act
does
in
states
where
governors
and
legislatures
have
wisely
allowed
it
the
affordable
care
act
provides
the
opportunity
for
many
americans
to
get
covered
under
for
the
first
time
so
in
for
example
helped
cut
the
number
of
uninsured
people
by
percent
just
in
the
last
three
weeks
think
about
that
more
americans
who
now
have
health
care
that
depend
on
website
now
if
one
of
the
percent
of
americans
who
have
health
insurance
either
because
you
afford
it
or
because
your
employer
offer
it
or
because
small
and
you
have
to
go
out
on
the
individual
market
and
buy
it
on
your
own
and
just
too
expensive
october
was
an
important
date
when
we
opened
the
new
where
people
without
health
insurance
or
who
afford
health
insurance
or
who
part
of
group
plan
can
finally
start
getting
affordable
coverage
and
the
idea
is
simple
by
enrolling
in
what
calling
these
you
become
part
of
big
group
plan
as
if
you
were
working
for
big
employer
group
plan
that
spreads
risk
between
sick
people
and
healthy
people
between
young
and
old
and
then
bargains
on
your
behalf
for
the
best
deal
on
health
care
what
done
is
essentially
create
competition
where
there
competition
before
we
created
these
big
group
plans
and
now
insurers
are
really
interested
in
getting
your
business
and
so
insurers
have
created
new
health
care
plans
with
more
choices
to
be
made
available
through
these
and
as
result
of
this
choice
and
this
competition
prices
have
come
down
when
you
add
the
new
tax
credits
that
many
people
are
eligible
for
through
the
law
then
the
prices
come
down
even
further
so
one
study
shows
that
through
new
options
created
by
the
affordable
care
act
nearly
in
uninsured
americans
will
find
that
they
can
get
covered
for
less
than
month
think
about
that
through
the
you
can
get
health
insurance
for
what
may
be
the
equivalent
of
your
cell
phone
bill
or
your
cable
bill
and
good
deal
so
the
fact
is
the
product
of
the
affordable
care
act
for
people
without
health
insurance
is
quality
health
insurance
affordable
and
that
product
is
working
really
good
and
it
turns
out
massive
demand
for
it
so
far
the
national
website
has
been
visited
nearly
million
times
twenty
million
times
and
great
demand
at
the
state
level
as
well
because
there
are
bunch
of
states
that
are
running
their
own
we
know
that
nearly
of
the
people
applying
in
and
for
example
are
under
years
old
they
understand
that
they
can
get
good
deal
at
low
costs
have
the
security
of
health
care
and
this
is
not
just
for
old
folks
like
me
that
everybody
needs
good
quality
health
insurance
and
all
told
more
than
half
million
consumers
across
the
country
have
successfully
submitted
applications
through
federal
and
state
and
many
of
those
applications
just
for
individuals
for
their
entire
families
so
even
more
people
are
already
looking
to
potentially
take
advantage
of
the
high
quality
affordable
insurance
that
is
provided
through
the
affordable
care
act
so
let
me
just
recap
here
the
product
is
good
the
health
insurance
being
provided
is
good
high
quality
and
affordable
people
can
save
money
significant
money
by
getting
insurance
being
provided
through
these
and
we
know
that
the
demand
is
there
people
are
rushing
to
see
available
and
those
who
have
already
had
chance
to
enroll
are
thrilled
with
the
result
every
day
people
who
were
stuck
with
premiums
because
of
conditions
are
getting
affordable
insurance
for
the
first
time
or
finding
like
did
that
saving
lot
of
money
every
day
women
are
finally
buying
coverage
that
charge
them
higher
premiums
than
men
for
the
same
care
every
day
people
are
discovering
that
new
health
insurance
plans
have
to
cover
maternity
care
mental
health
care
free
preventive
care
so
you
just
heard
story
she
owns
her
own
small
business
she
recently
became
the
first
woman
to
enroll
in
coverage
through
exchange
and
true
it
took
her
few
tries
but
it
was
worth
it
after
being
turned
down
for
insurance
three
times
due
to
minor
conditions
so
now
be
covered
save
bucks
month
and
she
have
to
worry
that
one
illness
or
accident
will
cost
her
her
business
that
worked
so
hard
to
build
and
is
not
alone
recently
received
letter
from
woman
named
in
washington
state
and
what
she
wrote
am
single
mom
no
child
support
and
had
insurance
for
years
because
too
expensive
my
son
has
and
requires
regular
doctor
visits
and
his
alone
cost
per
month
have
had
an
ongoing
problem
due
to
my
line
of
work
that
had
treated
now
finally
we
get
to
have
coverage
because
of
the
for
per
month
was
crying
the
other
day
when
signed
up
so
much
stress
now
that
is
not
untypical
for
lot
of
folks
like
who
have
been
struggling
without
health
insurance
what
the
affordable
care
act
is
all
about
the
point
is
the
essence
of
the
law
the
health
insurance
available
to
people
is
working
just
fine
in
some
cases
actually
exceeding
expectations
the
prices
are
lower
than
we
expected
the
choice
is
greater
than
we
expected
but
the
problem
has
been
that
the
website
supposed
to
make
it
easy
to
apply
for
and
purchase
the
insurance
is
not
working
the
way
it
should
for
everybody
and
no
it
the
website
has
been
too
slow
people
have
been
getting
stuck
during
the
application
process
and
think
fair
to
say
that
nobody
is
more
frustrated
by
that
than
am
precisely
because
the
product
is
good
want
the
cash
registers
to
work
want
the
checkout
lines
to
be
smooth
so
want
people
to
be
able
to
get
this
great
product
and
no
excuse
for
the
problems
and
these
problems
are
getting
fixed
but
while
working
out
the
kinks
in
the
system
want
everybody
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
problem
first
of
all
even
with
all
the
problems
at
the
website
is
still
working
for
lot
of
people
just
not
as
quick
or
efficient
or
consistent
as
we
want
and
although
many
of
these
folks
have
found
that
they
had
to
wait
longer
than
they
wanted
once
they
complete
the
process
very
happy
with
the
deal
available
to
them
just
like
second
want
everybody
to
remember
that
only
three
weeks
into
open
period
when
you
can
buy
these
new
plans
keep
in
mind
the
insurance
start
until
january
the
earliest
that
the
insurance
can
kick
in
no
one
who
decides
to
purchase
plan
has
to
pay
their
first
premium
until
december
and
unlike
the
day
after
thanksgiving
sales
for
the
latest
or
the
insurance
plans
run
out
not
going
to
sell
out
be
available
through
the
marketplace
throughout
the
open
period
the
prices
that
insurers
have
set
will
not
change
so
everybody
who
wants
insurance
through
the
marketplace
will
get
insurance
period
everybody
who
wants
insurance
through
the
marketplace
will
get
insurance
third
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
possibly
do
to
get
the
working
better
faster
sooner
got
people
working
overtime
to
boost
capacity
and
address
the
problems
experts
from
some
of
top
tech
companies
who
by
the
way
have
seen
things
like
this
happen
before
they
want
it
to
work
they
reaching
out
they
offering
to
send
help
had
some
of
the
best
it
talent
in
the
entire
country
join
the
team
and
well
into
to
fix
the
problem
and
we
are
confident
that
we
will
get
all
the
problems
fixed
number
four
while
the
website
will
ultimately
be
the
easiest
way
to
buy
insurance
through
the
marketplace
it
the
only
way
and
want
to
this
even
as
we
redouble
our
efforts
to
get
the
site
working
as
well
as
supposed
to
also
redoubling
our
efforts
to
make
sure
you
can
still
buy
the
same
quality
affordable
insurance
plans
available
on
the
marketplace
the
way
either
over
the
phone
or
in
person
and
by
the
way
there
are
lot
of
people
who
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
who
are
more
comfortable
working
on
the
phone
anyway
or
in
person
so
let
me
go
through
the
specifics
as
to
how
you
can
do
that
if
having
problems
with
the
website
or
you
just
prefer
dealing
with
person
yesterday
we
updated
the
home
page
to
offer
more
information
about
the
other
avenues
to
enroll
in
affordable
health
care
until
the
option
works
for
everybody
so
find
information
about
how
to
talk
to
specialist
who
can
help
you
apply
over
the
phone
or
to
receive
application
you
can
fill
out
yourself
and
mail
in
also
added
more
staff
to
the
call
where
you
can
apply
for
insurance
over
the
phone
those
are
already
they
been
working
but
lot
of
people
have
decided
first
to
go
to
the
website
but
keep
in
mind
these
call
are
already
up
and
running
and
you
can
get
your
questions
answered
by
real
people
hours
day
in
different
languages
the
phone
number
for
these
call
is
want
to
repeat
that
wait
times
have
averaged
less
than
one
minute
so
far
on
the
call
although
admit
that
the
wait
times
probably
might
go
up
little
bit
now
that
read
the
number
out
loud
on
national
television
but
the
point
is
the
call
are
available
you
can
talk
to
somebody
directly
and
they
can
walk
you
through
the
application
process
and
guarantee
you
if
one
thing
is
worth
the
wait
the
safety
and
security
of
health
care
that
you
can
afford
or
the
amount
of
money
that
you
can
save
by
buying
health
insurance
through
the
once
you
get
on
the
phone
with
trained
representative
it
usually
takes
about
minutes
for
an
individual
to
apply
for
coverage
about
minutes
for
family
once
you
apply
for
coverage
you
will
be
contacted
by
email
or
postal
mail
about
your
coverage
status
but
you
do
have
to
just
go
through
the
phone
you
can
also
apply
in
person
with
the
help
of
local
navigators
these
are
people
specially
trained
to
help
you
sign
up
for
health
care
and
they
exist
all
across
the
country
or
you
can
go
to
community
health
and
hospitals
just
visit
to
find
out
where
in
your
area
you
can
get
help
and
apply
for
insurance
in
person
and
finally
if
already
tried
to
apply
through
the
website
and
been
stuck
somewhere
along
the
way
do
not
worry
in
the
coming
weeks
we
will
contact
you
directly
personally
with
concrete
recommendation
for
how
you
can
complete
your
application
shop
for
coverage
pick
plan
that
meets
your
needs
and
get
covered
once
and
for
all
so
the
bottom
line
the
product
the
health
insurance
is
good
the
prices
are
good
it
is
good
deal
people
just
want
it
showing
up
to
buy
it
nobody
is
madder
than
me
about
the
fact
that
the
website
working
as
well
as
it
should
which
means
going
to
get
fixed
and
in
the
meantime
you
can
bypass
the
website
and
apply
by
phone
or
in
person
so
let
problems
with
the
website
deter
you
from
signing
up
or
signing
your
family
up
or
showing
your
friends
how
to
sign
up
because
it
is
worth
it
it
will
save
you
money
if
you
do
have
health
insurance
if
got
condition
it
will
save
you
money
and
it
will
give
you
the
security
that
your
family
needs
in
fact
even
with
the
website
issues
actually
made
the
overall
process
of
buying
insurance
through
the
marketplace
lot
smoother
and
easier
than
the
old
way
of
buying
insurance
on
your
own
part
of
the
challenge
here
is
that
lot
of
people
may
not
remember
what
like
to
buy
insurance
the
traditional
way
the
way
set
it
up
there
are
no
more
absurdly
long
application
forms
no
medical
history
questionnaire
that
goes
on
for
pages
and
pages
no
more
getting
denied
because
had
condition
instead
of
contacting
bunch
of
different
insurers
one
at
time
which
is
what
and
lot
of
people
who
are
shopping
on
the
individual
market
for
health
insurance
had
to
do
one
single
place
you
can
go
shop
and
compare
plans
that
have
to
compete
for
your
business
one
single
phone
number
you
can
call
for
help
and
once
the
kinks
in
the
website
have
been
ironed
out
it
will
be
an
even
smoother
and
even
easier
but
in
the
meantime
we
will
help
you
sign
up
because
consumers
want
to
buy
this
product
and
insurance
companies
want
to
sell
it
to
you
now
let
me
close
by
addressing
some
of
the
politics
that
have
swirled
around
the
affordable
care
act
that
the
republican
party
has
made
blocking
the
affordable
care
act
its
signature
policy
idea
sometimes
it
seems
to
be
the
one
thing
that
unifies
the
party
these
days
in
fact
they
were
willing
to
shut
down
the
government
and
potentially
harm
the
global
economy
to
try
to
get
it
repealed
and
sure
that
given
the
problems
with
the
website
so
far
going
to
be
looking
to
go
after
it
even
harder
and
let
admit
it
with
the
website
not
working
as
well
as
it
needs
to
work
that
makes
lot
of
supporters
nervous
because
they
know
how
it
been
subject
to
so
much
attack
the
affordable
care
act
generally
but
just
want
to
remind
everybody
we
did
not
wage
this
long
and
contentious
battle
just
around
website
not
what
this
was
about
we
waged
this
battle
to
make
sure
that
millions
of
americans
in
the
wealthiest
nation
on
earth
finally
have
the
same
chance
to
get
the
same
security
of
affordable
quality
health
care
as
anybody
else
what
this
is
about
and
the
affordable
care
act
has
done
that
people
can
now
get
good
insurance
people
with
conditions
can
now
afford
insurance
and
if
the
launch
of
this
website
proves
anything
that
people
across
the
country
just
need
that
security
they
want
that
security
they
want
it
and
in
the
meantime
said
many
times
willing
to
work
with
anyone
on
any
idea
to
make
this
law
perform
even
better
but
time
for
folks
to
stop
rooting
for
its
failure
because
hardworking
families
are
rooting
for
its
success
and
if
the
product
is
good
they
willing
to
be
patient
got
letter
last
week
from
man
named
john
in
he
used
the
new
marketplace
to
get
himself
and
his
wife
covered
and
save
lot
of
money
and
what
he
said
because
it
pretty
much
sums
up
my
message
today
the
website
really
stank
for
the
first
instead
of
paying
per
month
for
group
insurance
plan
we
have
plan
that
will
only
cost
us
month
savings
of
per
john
said
that
while
he
saw
when
he
saw
what
be
paying
he
turned
to
his
wife
and
told
her
we
might
just
pull
through
we
can
afford
this
and
john
eventually
predicted
that
the
website
will
work
like
champ
so
john
he
was
frustrated
by
the
website
but
he
feeling
little
less
frustrated
once
he
found
out
that
he
was
saving
bucks
month
on
his
health
insurance
and
john
is
right
the
website
is
going
to
get
fixed
and
the
law
works
that
why
we
fought
so
hard
to
pass
this
law
to
save
folks
like
john
money
to
give
people
who
do
have
health
insurance
the
chance
to
get
it
for
the
first
time
to
lift
from
the
american
people
the
crushing
burden
of
unaffordable
health
care
to
free
families
from
the
pervasive
fear
that
one
illness
female
audience
member
appears
to
losing
consciousness
there
you
go
you
are
ok
right
here
got
you
no
no
you
okay
this
happens
when
talk
too
long
you
be
okay
here
why
do
you
go
good
catch
by
the
way
whoever
was
here
but
that
always
our
goal
to
free
families
from
the
pervasive
fear
that
one
illness
or
one
injury
might
cost
you
everything
that
you
dedicated
lifetime
to
build
our
goal
has
always
been
to
declare
that
in
this
country
the
security
of
health
care
is
not
privilege
for
fortunate
few
it
right
for
all
to
enjoy
that
what
the
affordable
care
act
is
all
about
that
its
promise
and
intend
to
deliver
on
that
promise
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
good
morning
everybody
at
midnight
last
night
for
the
first
time
in
years
republicans
in
congress
chose
to
shut
down
the
federal
government
let
me
be
more
specific
one
faction
of
one
party
in
one
house
of
congress
in
one
branch
of
government
shut
down
major
parts
of
the
government
all
because
they
like
one
law
this
republican
shutdown
did
not
have
to
happen
but
want
every
american
to
understand
why
it
did
happen
republicans
in
the
house
of
representatives
refused
to
fund
the
government
unless
we
or
dismantled
the
affordable
care
act
shut
down
the
government
over
an
ideological
crusade
to
deny
affordable
health
insurance
to
millions
of
americans
in
other
words
they
demanded
ransom
just
for
doing
their
job
and
many
representatives
including
an
increasing
number
of
republicans
have
made
it
clear
that
had
they
been
allowed
by
speaker
to
take
simple
up
or
down
vote
on
keeping
the
government
open
with
no
partisan
strings
attached
enough
votes
from
both
parties
would
have
kept
the
american
government
open
and
operating
we
may
not
know
the
full
impact
of
this
republican
shutdown
for
some
time
it
will
depend
on
how
long
it
lasts
but
we
do
know
couple
of
things
we
know
that
the
last
time
republicans
shut
down
the
government
in
it
hurt
our
economy
and
unlike
our
economy
is
still
recovering
from
the
worst
recession
in
generations
we
know
that
certain
services
and
benefits
that
seniors
and
veterans
and
business
owners
depend
on
must
be
put
on
hold
certain
offices
along
with
every
national
park
and
monument
must
be
closed
and
while
last
night
signed
legislation
to
make
sure
our
million
military
are
paid
through
the
shutdown
hundreds
of
thousands
of
civilian
workers
many
still
on
the
job
many
forced
to
stay
home
being
paid
even
if
they
have
families
to
support
and
local
businesses
that
rely
on
them
and
we
know
that
the
longer
this
shutdown
continues
the
worse
the
effects
will
be
more
families
will
be
hurt
more
businesses
will
be
harmed
so
once
again
urge
house
republicans
to
reopen
the
government
restart
the
services
americans
depend
on
and
allow
the
public
servants
who
have
been
sent
home
to
return
to
work
this
is
only
going
to
happen
when
republicans
they
get
to
hold
the
entire
economy
hostage
over
ideological
demands
as
said
repeatedly
am
prepared
to
work
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
do
the
things
we
need
to
do
to
grow
the
economy
and
create
jobs
and
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
over
the
long
run
although
should
add
this
shutdown
about
deficits
or
spending
or
budgets
after
all
our
deficits
are
falling
at
the
fastest
pace
in
years
cut
them
in
half
since
took
office
in
fact
many
of
the
demands
the
republicans
are
now
making
would
actually
raise
our
deficits
no
this
shutdown
is
not
about
deficits
not
about
budgets
this
shutdown
is
about
rolling
back
our
efforts
to
provide
health
insurance
to
folks
who
have
it
all
about
rolling
back
the
affordable
care
act
this
more
than
anything
else
seems
to
be
what
the
republican
party
stands
for
these
days
know
strange
that
one
party
would
make
keeping
people
uninsured
the
of
their
agenda
but
that
apparently
is
what
it
is
and
of
course
stranger
still
is
that
shutting
down
our
government
accomplish
their
stated
goal
the
affordable
care
act
is
law
that
passed
the
house
it
passed
the
senate
the
supreme
court
ruled
it
constitutional
it
was
central
issue
in
last
election
it
is
settled
and
it
is
here
to
stay
and
because
of
its
funding
sources
not
impacted
by
government
shutdown
and
these
americans
are
here
with
me
today
because
even
though
the
government
is
closed
big
part
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
now
open
for
business
and
for
them
and
millions
like
them
this
is
historic
day
for
good
reason
been
long
time
coming
but
today
americans
who
have
been
forced
to
go
without
insurance
can
now
visit
and
enroll
in
affordable
new
plans
that
offer
quality
coverage
that
starts
today
and
people
will
have
six
months
to
sign
up
so
over
the
next
six
months
people
are
going
to
have
the
opportunity
in
many
cases
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
to
get
affordable
coverage
that
they
desperately
need
now
of
course
if
one
of
the
percent
of
americans
who
already
have
health
insurance
you
need
to
do
thing
already
benefiting
from
new
benefits
and
protections
that
have
been
in
place
for
some
time
under
this
law
but
for
the
percent
of
americans
who
do
have
health
insurance
this
opportunity
is
let
me
just
tell
folks
few
stories
that
are
represented
here
today
few
years
ago
left
her
job
in
new
york
to
take
care
of
her
parents
and
for
while
she
had
temporary
insurance
that
covered
her
multiple
sclerosis
but
when
it
expired
many
insurers
cover
her
because
of
her
and
she
ended
up
paying
month
nowhere
near
affordable
so
starting
today
she
can
get
covered
for
much
less
because
new
plan
use
your
medical
history
to
charge
you
more
than
anybody
else
premiums
once
forced
to
choose
between
paying
her
rent
or
paying
for
health
insurance
been
uninsured
ever
since
so
she
pays
all
of
her
medical
bills
out
of
pocket
puts
some
on
her
credit
card
making
them
even
harder
to
pay
says
talk
about
those
who
fall
through
the
cracks
fell
through
the
cracks
years
ago
and
been
stuck
there
ever
well
starting
today
can
get
covered
just
like
everybody
else
was
laid
off
from
her
job
year
ago
today
six
months
ago
she
was
diagnosed
with
brain
she
afford
insurance
on
the
individual
market
so
she
received
treatment
yet
her
daughter
student
at
the
university
of
is
considering
dropping
out
of
school
to
help
pay
her
bills
well
starting
today
thanks
to
the
affordable
care
act
can
get
covered
without
forcing
her
daughter
to
give
up
on
her
dreams
so
if
these
stories
of
hardworking
americans
sound
familiar
to
you
well
starting
today
you
and
your
friends
and
your
family
and
your
coworkers
can
get
covered
too
just
visit
and
there
you
can
compare
insurance
plans
side
by
side
the
same
way
shop
for
plane
ticket
on
kayak
or
on
amazon
you
enter
some
basic
information
be
presented
with
list
of
quality
affordable
plans
that
are
available
in
your
area
with
clear
descriptions
of
what
each
plan
covers
and
what
it
will
cost
find
more
choices
more
competition
and
in
many
cases
lower
prices
most
uninsured
americans
will
find
that
they
can
get
covered
for
or
less
and
you
do
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
go
on
the
website
check
it
out
for
yourself
and
then
show
it
to
your
family
and
your
friends
and
help
them
get
covered
just
like
mayors
and
churches
and
community
groups
and
companies
are
already
fanning
out
to
do
across
the
country
and
hotline
where
you
can
apply
over
the
phone
and
get
help
with
the
application
or
just
get
questions
that
you
have
answered
by
real
people
in
different
languages
so
let
me
give
you
that
number
the
number
is
check
out
call
that
number
show
your
family
and
friends
how
to
use
it
and
we
can
get
america
covered
once
and
for
all
so
that
the
struggles
that
these
folks
have
gone
through
and
millions
around
the
country
have
gone
through
for
years
finally
get
addressed
and
let
me
just
remind
people
why
think
this
is
so
important
heard
striking
statistic
yesterday
if
you
get
cancer
you
are
percent
more
likely
to
live
another
five
years
if
you
have
insurance
than
if
you
think
about
that
that
is
what
it
means
to
have
health
insurance
set
aside
the
issues
of
security
and
finances
and
how
impacted
by
that
the
stress
involved
in
not
knowing
whether
or
not
going
to
have
health
care
this
is
stuff
tens
of
thousands
of
americans
die
each
year
just
because
they
have
health
insurance
millions
more
live
with
the
fear
that
go
broke
if
they
get
sick
and
today
we
begin
to
free
millions
of
our
fellow
americans
from
that
fear
already
millions
of
young
adults
have
been
able
to
stay
on
their
plans
until
they
turn
millions
of
seniors
already
have
gotten
discount
on
their
prescription
medicines
already
millions
of
families
have
actually
received
rebates
from
insurance
companies
that
spend
enough
on
their
health
care
so
this
law
means
more
choice
more
competition
lower
costs
for
millions
of
americans
and
this
law
just
mean
economic
security
for
our
families
it
means
finally
addressing
the
biggest
drivers
of
our
deficits
it
means
stronger
economy
remember
most
republicans
have
made
whole
bunch
of
predictions
about
this
law
that
come
true
there
are
no
costs
growing
at
the
slowest
rate
in
years
the
last
three
years
since
signed
the
affordable
care
act
into
law
are
the
three
slowest
rates
of
health
spending
growth
on
record
and
contrary
to
republican
claims
this
law
our
economy
over
the
past
three
and
half
years
our
businesses
have
created
million
new
jobs
just
today
we
learned
that
our
manufacturers
are
growing
at
the
fastest
rate
in
two
and
half
years
they
have
factored
in
the
affordable
care
act
they
do
think
problem
weighing
on
the
economy
is
not
the
affordable
care
act
but
the
constant
series
of
crises
and
the
unwillingness
to
pass
reasonable
budget
by
faction
of
the
republican
party
now
like
every
new
law
every
new
product
there
are
going
to
be
some
in
the
process
along
the
way
that
we
will
fix
been
saying
this
from
the
start
for
example
we
found
out
that
there
have
been
times
this
morning
where
the
site
has
been
running
more
slowly
than
it
normally
will
the
reason
is
because
more
than
one
million
people
visited
before
in
the
morning
to
put
that
in
context
there
were
five
times
more
users
in
the
marketplace
this
morning
than
have
ever
been
on
at
one
time
that
gives
you
sense
of
how
important
this
is
to
millions
of
americans
around
the
country
and
good
thing
and
we
going
to
be
speeding
things
up
in
the
next
few
hours
to
handle
all
this
demand
that
exceeds
anything
that
we
had
expected
consider
that
just
couple
of
weeks
ago
apple
rolled
out
new
mobile
operating
system
and
within
days
they
found
so
they
fixed
it
remember
anybody
suggesting
apple
should
stop
selling
or
or
threatening
to
shut
down
the
company
if
they
not
how
we
do
things
in
america
we
actively
root
for
failure
we
get
to
work
we
make
things
happen
we
make
them
better
we
keep
going
so
in
that
context
work
with
anybody
got
serious
idea
to
make
the
affordable
care
act
work
better
said
that
repeatedly
but
as
long
as
am
president
will
not
give
in
to
reckless
demands
by
some
in
the
republican
party
to
deny
affordable
health
insurance
to
millions
of
hardworking
americans
want
republicans
in
congress
to
know
these
are
the
americans
hurt
if
you
were
allowed
to
dismantle
this
law
americans
like
and
who
now
finally
have
the
opportunity
for
basic
security
and
peace
of
mind
of
health
care
just
like
everybody
else
including
members
of
congress
the
notion
that
make
condition
for
reopening
the
government
that
make
sure
these
folks
have
health
care
that
make
any
sense
it
make
any
sense
now
let
me
make
one
closing
point
this
republican
shutdown
threatens
our
economy
at
time
when
millions
of
americans
are
still
looking
for
work
and
businesses
are
starting
to
get
some
traction
so
the
timing
is
not
good
of
course
lot
of
the
republicans
in
the
house
ran
for
office
two
years
ago
promising
to
shut
down
the
government
and
so
apparently
they
now
gotten
their
wish
but
as
said
before
the
irony
that
the
house
republicans
have
to
contend
with
is
they
shut
down
whole
bunch
of
parts
of
the
government
but
the
affordable
care
act
is
still
open
for
business
and
this
may
be
why
you
got
many
republican
governors
and
senators
and
even
growing
number
of
reasonable
republican
congressmen
who
are
telling
the
extreme
right
of
their
party
to
knock
it
off
pass
budget
move
on
and
want
to
the
fact
that
congress
just
have
to
end
this
shutdown
and
reopen
the
government
congress
generally
has
to
stop
governing
by
crisis
they
have
to
break
this
habit
it
is
drag
on
the
economy
it
is
not
worthy
of
this
country
for
example
one
of
the
most
important
things
congress
has
to
do
in
the
next
couple
weeks
is
to
raise
what
called
the
debt
ceiling
and
it
important
to
understand
what
this
is
this
is
routine
vote
congress
has
taken
this
vote
times
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling
since
took
office
it
does
not
cost
taxpayers
single
dime
it
does
not
grow
our
deficits
by
single
dime
it
does
not
anybody
to
spend
any
new
money
whatsoever
all
it
does
is
the
treasury
to
pay
the
bills
on
what
congress
has
already
spent
think
about
that
if
you
buy
car
and
got
car
note
you
do
not
save
money
by
not
paying
your
car
note
just
deadbeat
if
you
buy
house
you
save
money
by
not
yourself
to
pay
the
mortgage
just
going
to
be
foreclosed
on
your
home
what
this
is
about
it
is
routine
it
is
what
supposed
to
do
this
is
not
concession
to
me
it
is
not
some
demand
unreasonable
that
making
this
is
what
congress
is
supposed
to
do
as
routine
matter
and
they
wait
until
the
last
minute
to
do
it
the
last
time
republicans
even
threatened
this
course
of
action
many
of
you
remember
back
in
our
economy
staggered
our
credit
rating
was
downgraded
for
the
first
time
if
they
go
through
with
it
this
time
and
force
the
united
states
to
default
on
its
obligations
for
the
first
time
in
history
it
would
be
far
more
dangerous
than
government
shutdown
as
bad
as
shutdown
is
it
would
be
an
economic
shutdown
so
speak
more
on
this
in
the
coming
days
but
let
me
repeat
will
not
negotiate
over
responsibility
to
pay
bills
already
racked
up
not
going
to
allow
anybody
to
drag
the
good
name
of
the
united
states
of
america
through
the
mud
just
to
settled
election
or
extract
ideological
demands
nobody
gets
to
hurt
our
economy
and
millions
of
hardworking
families
over
law
you
like
there
are
whole
bunch
of
things
that
like
to
see
passed
through
congress
that
the
house
republicans
passed
yet
and
not
out
there
saying
well
not
going
to
let
america
default
unless
congress
does
something
that
they
want
to
do
not
how
adults
operate
certainly
not
how
our
government
should
operate
and
true
whether
democrat
in
this
office
or
republican
in
this
office
matter
whether
democratic
house
of
representatives
or
house
of
representatives
there
are
certain
rules
that
everybody
abides
by
because
we
want
to
hurt
other
people
just
because
we
have
political
disagreement
so
my
basic
message
to
congress
is
this
pass
budget
end
the
government
shutdown
pay
your
bills
prevent
an
economic
shutdown
wait
delay
put
our
economy
or
our
people
through
this
any
longer
am
more
than
happy
to
work
with
them
on
all
kinds
of
issues
want
to
get
back
to
work
on
the
things
that
the
american
people
sent
us
here
to
work
on
creating
new
jobs
new
growth
new
security
for
our
middle
class
better
than
this
certainly
the
american
people
are
lot
better
than
this
and
believe
that
what
accomplished
for
and
and
and
tens
of
millions
of
their
fellow
on
this
day
proves
that
even
when
the
odds
are
long
and
the
obstacles
are
many
we
are
and
always
will
be
country
that
can
do
great
things
together
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
thank
you
all
of
you
for
the
great
work
that
doing
and
thank
you
for
the
outstanding
work
that
doing
making
sure
that
millions
of
americans
can
get
health
insurance
thank
you
president
secretary
general
fellow
delegates
ladies
and
gentlemen
each
year
we
come
together
to
reaffirm
the
founding
vision
of
this
institution
for
most
of
recorded
history
individual
aspirations
were
subject
to
the
whims
of
tyrants
and
empires
divisions
of
race
and
religion
and
tribe
were
settled
through
the
sword
and
the
clash
of
armies
the
idea
that
nations
and
peoples
could
come
together
in
peace
to
solve
their
disputes
and
advance
common
prosperity
seemed
unimaginable
it
took
the
awful
carnage
of
two
world
wars
to
shift
our
thinking
the
leaders
who
built
the
united
nations
were
not
they
did
not
think
this
body
could
eradicate
all
wars
but
in
the
wake
of
millions
dead
and
continents
in
rubble
and
with
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
that
could
annihilate
planet
they
understood
that
humanity
could
not
survive
the
course
it
was
on
and
so
they
gave
us
this
institution
believing
that
it
could
allow
us
to
resolve
conflicts
enforce
rules
of
and
build
habits
of
cooperation
that
would
grow
stronger
over
time
for
decades
the
united
nations
has
in
fact
made
difference
from
helping
to
eradicate
disease
to
educating
children
to
peace
but
like
every
generation
of
leaders
we
face
new
and
profound
challenges
and
this
body
continues
to
be
tested
the
question
is
whether
we
possess
the
wisdom
and
the
courage
as
and
members
of
an
international
community
to
squarely
meet
those
challenges
whether
the
united
nations
can
meet
the
tests
of
our
time
for
much
of
my
tenure
as
president
some
of
our
most
urgent
challenges
have
revolved
around
an
increasingly
integrated
global
economy
and
our
efforts
to
recover
from
the
worst
economic
crisis
of
our
lifetime
now
five
years
after
the
global
economy
collapsed
and
thanks
to
coordinated
efforts
by
the
countries
here
today
jobs
are
being
created
global
financial
systems
have
and
people
are
once
again
being
lifted
out
of
poverty
but
this
progress
is
fragile
and
unequal
and
we
still
have
work
to
do
together
to
assure
that
our
citizens
can
access
the
opportunities
that
they
need
to
thrive
in
the
century
together
also
worked
to
end
decade
of
war
five
years
ago
nearly
americans
were
serving
in
way
and
the
war
in
iraq
was
the
dominant
issue
in
our
relationship
with
the
rest
of
the
world
today
all
of
our
troops
have
left
iraq
next
year
an
international
coalition
will
end
its
war
in
having
achieved
its
mission
of
dismantling
the
core
of
that
attacked
us
on
for
the
united
states
these
new
circumstances
have
also
meant
shifting
away
from
perpetual
war
footing
beyond
bringing
our
troops
home
we
have
limited
the
use
of
drones
so
they
target
only
those
who
pose
continuing
imminent
threat
to
the
united
states
where
capture
is
not
feasible
and
there
is
near
certainty
of
no
civilian
casualties
transferring
detainees
to
other
countries
and
trying
terrorists
in
courts
of
law
while
working
diligently
to
close
the
prison
at
bay
and
just
as
we
reviewed
how
we
deploy
our
extraordinary
military
capabilities
in
way
that
lives
up
to
our
ideals
begun
to
review
the
way
that
we
gather
intelligence
so
that
we
properly
balance
the
legitimate
security
concerns
of
our
citizens
and
allies
with
the
privacy
concerns
that
all
people
share
as
result
of
this
work
and
cooperation
with
allies
and
partners
the
world
is
more
stable
than
it
was
five
years
ago
but
even
glance
at
headlines
indicates
that
dangers
remain
in
kenya
seen
terrorists
target
innocent
civilians
in
crowded
shopping
mall
and
our
hearts
go
out
to
the
families
of
those
who
have
been
affected
in
pakistan
nearly
people
were
recently
killed
by
suicide
bombers
outside
church
in
iraq
killings
and
car
bombs
continue
to
be
terrible
part
of
life
and
meanwhile
has
splintered
into
regional
networks
and
militias
which
does
give
them
the
capacity
at
this
point
to
carry
out
attacks
like
but
does
pose
serious
threats
to
governments
and
diplomats
businesses
and
civilians
all
across
the
globe
just
as
significantly
the
convulsions
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
have
laid
bare
deep
divisions
within
societies
as
an
old
order
is
upended
and
people
grapple
with
what
comes
next
peaceful
movements
have
too
often
been
answered
by
violence
from
those
resisting
change
and
from
extremists
trying
to
hijack
change
sectarian
conflict
has
and
the
potential
spread
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
continues
to
cast
shadow
over
the
pursuit
of
peace
nowhere
have
we
seen
these
trends
converge
more
powerfully
than
in
syria
there
peaceful
protests
against
an
authoritarian
regime
were
met
with
repression
and
slaughter
in
the
face
of
such
carnage
many
retreated
to
their
sectarian
identity
and
christian
and
and
the
situation
into
civil
war
the
international
community
the
stakes
early
on
but
our
response
has
not
matched
the
scale
of
the
challenge
aid
can
not
keep
pace
with
the
suffering
of
the
wounded
and
displaced
peace
process
is
stillborn
america
and
others
have
worked
to
bolster
the
moderate
opposition
but
extremist
groups
have
still
taken
root
to
exploit
the
crisis
traditional
allies
have
propped
him
up
citing
principles
of
sovereignty
to
shield
his
regime
and
on
august
the
regime
used
chemical
weapons
in
an
attack
that
killed
more
than
people
including
hundreds
of
children
now
the
crisis
in
syria
and
the
of
the
region
goes
to
the
heart
of
broader
challenges
that
the
international
community
must
now
confront
how
should
we
respond
to
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
conflicts
between
countries
but
also
conflicts
within
them
how
do
we
address
the
choice
of
standing
callously
by
while
children
are
subjected
to
nerve
gas
or
embroiling
ourselves
in
someone
civil
war
what
is
the
role
of
force
in
resolving
disputes
that
threaten
the
stability
of
the
region
and
undermine
all
basic
standards
of
conduct
what
is
the
role
of
the
united
nations
and
international
law
in
meeting
cries
for
justice
today
want
to
outline
where
the
united
states
of
america
stands
on
these
issues
with
respect
to
syria
we
believe
that
as
starting
point
the
international
community
must
enforce
the
ban
on
chemical
weapons
when
stated
my
willingness
to
order
limited
strike
against
the
regime
in
response
to
the
brazen
use
of
chemical
weapons
did
not
do
so
lightly
did
so
because
believe
it
is
in
the
security
interest
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
interest
of
the
world
to
meaningfully
enforce
prohibition
whose
origins
are
older
than
the
united
nations
itself
the
ban
against
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
even
in
war
has
been
agreed
to
by
percent
of
humanity
it
is
strengthened
by
the
searing
memories
of
soldiers
suffocating
in
the
trenches
jews
slaughtered
in
gas
chambers
iranians
poisoned
in
the
many
tens
of
thousands
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
the
regime
used
such
weapons
on
august
inspectors
gave
clear
accounting
that
advanced
rockets
fired
large
quantities
of
gas
at
civilians
these
rockets
were
fired
from
and
landed
in
opposition
an
insult
to
human
reason
and
to
the
legitimacy
of
this
institution
to
suggest
that
anyone
other
than
the
regime
carried
out
this
attack
now
know
that
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
attack
there
were
those
who
questioned
the
legitimacy
of
even
limited
strike
in
the
absence
of
clear
mandate
from
the
security
council
but
without
credible
military
threat
the
security
council
had
demonstrated
no
inclination
to
act
at
all
however
as
discussed
with
president
for
over
year
most
recently
in
my
preference
has
always
been
diplomatic
resolution
to
this
issue
and
in
the
past
several
weeks
the
united
states
russia
and
our
allies
have
reached
an
agreement
to
place
chemical
weapons
under
international
control
and
then
to
destroy
them
the
syrian
government
took
first
step
by
giving
an
accounting
of
its
stockpiles
now
there
must
be
strong
security
council
resolution
to
verify
that
the
regime
is
keeping
its
commitments
and
there
must
be
consequences
if
they
fail
to
do
so
if
we
can
not
agree
even
on
this
then
it
will
show
that
the
united
nations
is
incapable
of
enforcing
the
most
basic
of
international
laws
on
the
other
hand
if
we
succeed
it
will
send
powerful
message
that
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
has
no
place
in
the
century
and
that
this
body
means
what
it
says
agreement
on
chemical
weapons
should
larger
diplomatic
effort
to
reach
political
settlement
within
syria
do
not
believe
that
military
action
by
those
within
syria
or
by
external
powers
can
achieve
lasting
peace
nor
do
believe
that
america
or
any
nation
should
determine
who
will
lead
syria
that
is
for
the
syrian
people
to
decide
nevertheless
leader
who
slaughtered
his
citizens
and
gassed
children
to
death
can
not
regain
the
legitimacy
to
lead
badly
fractured
country
the
notion
that
syria
can
somehow
return
to
status
is
time
for
russia
and
iran
to
that
insisting
on
rule
will
lead
directly
to
the
outcome
that
they
fear
an
increasingly
violent
space
for
extremists
to
operate
in
turn
those
of
us
who
continue
to
support
the
moderate
opposition
must
persuade
them
that
the
syrian
people
can
not
afford
collapse
of
state
institutions
and
that
political
settlement
can
not
be
reached
without
addressing
the
legitimate
fears
and
concerns
of
and
other
minorities
we
are
committed
to
working
this
political
track
and
as
we
pursue
settlement
remember
this
is
not
no
longer
in
cold
war
no
great
game
to
be
won
nor
does
america
have
any
interest
in
syria
beyond
the
wellbeing
of
its
people
the
stability
of
its
the
elimination
of
chemical
weapons
and
ensuring
that
it
does
not
become
safe
haven
for
terrorists
welcome
the
influence
of
all
nations
that
can
help
bring
about
peaceful
resolution
of
civil
war
and
as
we
move
the
geneva
process
forward
urge
all
nations
here
to
step
up
to
meet
humanitarian
needs
in
syria
and
surrounding
countries
america
has
committed
over
billion
dollars
to
this
effort
and
today
can
announce
that
we
will
be
providing
an
additional
million
no
aid
can
take
the
place
of
political
resolution
that
gives
the
syrian
people
the
chance
to
rebuild
their
country
but
it
can
help
desperate
people
to
survive
what
broader
conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
policy
toward
syria
know
there
are
those
who
have
been
frustrated
by
our
unwillingness
to
use
our
military
might
to
depose
and
believe
that
failure
to
do
so
indicates
weakening
of
american
resolve
in
the
region
others
have
suggested
that
my
willingness
to
direct
even
limited
military
strikes
to
deter
the
further
use
of
chemical
weapons
shows
learned
nothing
from
iraq
and
that
america
continues
to
seek
control
over
the
middle
east
for
our
own
purposes
in
this
way
the
situation
in
syria
mirrors
contradiction
that
has
persisted
in
the
region
for
decades
the
united
states
is
chastised
for
meddling
in
the
region
accused
of
having
hand
in
all
manner
of
conspiracy
at
the
same
time
the
united
states
is
blamed
for
failing
to
do
enough
to
solve
the
problems
and
for
showing
indifference
toward
suffering
muslim
populations
some
of
this
is
inevitable
given
role
in
the
world
but
these
contradictory
attitudes
have
practical
impact
on
the
american
support
for
our
involvement
in
the
region
and
allow
leaders
in
the
region
as
well
as
the
international
community
sometimes
to
avoid
addressing
difficult
problems
themselves
so
let
me
take
this
opportunity
to
outline
what
has
been
policy
towards
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
and
what
will
be
my
policy
during
the
remainder
of
my
presidency
the
united
states
of
america
is
prepared
to
use
all
elements
of
our
power
including
military
force
to
secure
our
core
interests
in
the
region
we
will
confront
external
aggression
against
our
allies
and
partners
as
we
did
in
the
gulf
war
we
will
ensure
the
free
flow
of
energy
from
the
region
to
the
world
although
america
is
steadily
reducing
our
own
dependence
on
imported
oil
the
world
still
depends
on
the
energy
supply
and
severe
disruption
could
the
entire
global
economy
we
will
dismantle
terrorist
networks
that
threaten
our
people
wherever
possible
we
will
build
the
capacity
of
our
partners
respect
the
sovereignty
of
nations
and
work
to
address
the
root
causes
of
terror
but
when
necessary
to
defend
the
united
states
against
terrorist
attack
we
will
take
direct
action
and
finally
we
will
not
tolerate
the
development
or
use
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
just
as
we
consider
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
in
syria
to
be
threat
to
our
own
national
security
we
reject
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
that
could
trigger
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
region
and
undermine
the
global
regime
now
to
say
that
these
are
core
interests
is
not
to
say
that
they
are
our
only
interests
we
deeply
believe
it
is
in
our
interests
to
see
middle
east
and
north
africa
that
is
peaceful
and
prosperous
and
will
continue
to
promote
democracy
and
human
rights
and
open
markets
because
we
believe
these
practices
achieve
peace
and
prosperity
but
also
believe
that
we
can
rarely
achieve
these
objectives
through
unilateral
american
action
particularly
through
military
action
iraq
shows
us
that
democracy
can
not
simply
be
imposed
by
force
rather
these
objectives
are
best
achieved
when
we
partner
with
the
international
community
and
with
the
countries
and
peoples
of
the
region
so
what
does
this
mean
going
forward
in
the
near
term
diplomatic
efforts
will
focus
on
two
particular
issues
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
and
the
conflict
while
these
issues
are
not
the
cause
of
all
the
problems
they
have
been
major
source
of
instability
for
far
too
long
and
resolving
them
can
help
serve
as
foundation
for
broader
peace
the
united
states
and
iran
have
been
isolated
from
one
another
since
the
islamic
revolution
of
this
mistrust
has
deep
roots
iranians
have
long
complained
of
history
of
interference
in
their
affairs
and
of
role
in
overthrowing
an
iranian
government
during
the
cold
war
on
the
other
hand
americans
see
an
iranian
government
that
has
declared
the
united
states
an
enemy
and
directly
or
through
proxies
taken
american
hostages
killed
troops
and
civilians
and
threatened
our
ally
israel
with
destruction
believe
this
difficult
history
can
be
overcome
overnight
the
suspicions
run
too
deep
but
do
believe
that
if
we
can
resolve
the
issue
of
nuclear
program
that
can
serve
as
major
step
down
long
road
towards
different
relationship
one
based
on
mutual
interests
and
mutual
respect
since
took
office
made
it
clear
in
letters
to
the
supreme
leader
in
iran
and
more
recently
to
president
that
america
prefers
to
resolve
our
concerns
over
nuclear
program
peacefully
although
we
are
determined
to
prevent
iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapon
we
are
not
seeking
regime
change
and
we
respect
the
right
of
the
iranian
people
to
access
peaceful
nuclear
energy
instead
we
insist
that
the
iranian
government
meet
its
responsibilities
under
the
nuclear
treaty
and
security
council
resolutions
meanwhile
the
supreme
leader
has
issued
fatwa
against
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
and
president
has
just
recently
reiterated
that
the
islamic
republic
will
never
develop
nuclear
weapon
so
these
statements
made
by
our
respective
governments
should
offer
the
basis
for
meaningful
agreement
we
should
be
able
to
achieve
resolution
that
respects
the
rights
of
the
iranian
people
while
giving
the
world
confidence
that
the
iranian
program
is
peaceful
but
to
succeed
conciliatory
words
will
have
to
be
matched
by
actions
that
are
transparent
and
verifiable
after
all
it
the
iranian
choices
that
have
led
to
the
comprehensive
sanctions
that
are
currently
in
place
and
this
is
not
simply
an
issue
between
the
united
states
and
iran
the
world
has
seen
iran
evade
its
responsibilities
in
the
past
and
has
an
abiding
interest
in
making
sure
that
iran
meets
its
obligations
in
the
future
but
want
to
be
clear
we
are
encouraged
that
president
received
from
the
iranian
people
mandate
to
pursue
more
moderate
course
and
given
president
stated
commitment
to
reach
an
agreement
am
directing
john
to
pursue
this
effort
with
the
iranian
government
in
close
cooperation
with
the
european
union
the
united
kingdom
france
germany
russia
and
china
the
roadblocks
may
prove
to
be
too
great
but
firmly
believe
the
diplomatic
path
must
be
tested
for
while
the
status
will
only
deepen
isolation
genuine
commitment
to
go
down
different
path
will
be
good
for
the
region
and
the
world
and
will
help
the
iranian
people
meet
their
extraordinary
potential
in
commerce
and
culture
in
science
and
education
we
are
also
determined
to
resolve
conflict
that
goes
back
even
further
than
our
differences
with
iran
and
that
is
the
conflict
between
and
israelis
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
will
never
compromise
our
commitment
to
security
nor
our
support
for
its
existence
as
jewish
state
earlier
this
year
in
was
inspired
by
young
israelis
who
stood
up
for
the
belief
that
peace
was
necessary
just
and
possible
and
believe
growing
recognition
within
israel
that
the
occupation
of
the
west
bank
is
tearing
at
the
democratic
fabric
of
the
jewish
state
but
the
children
of
israel
have
the
right
to
live
in
world
where
the
nations
assembled
in
this
body
fully
their
country
and
where
we
unequivocally
reject
those
who
fire
rockets
at
their
homes
or
incite
others
to
hate
them
likewise
the
united
states
remains
committed
to
the
belief
that
the
people
have
right
to
live
with
security
and
dignity
in
their
own
sovereign
state
on
the
same
trip
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
young
in
whose
ambition
and
incredible
potential
are
matched
by
the
pain
they
feel
in
having
no
firm
place
in
the
community
of
nations
they
are
understandably
cynical
that
real
progress
will
ever
be
made
and
frustrated
by
their
families
enduring
the
daily
indignity
of
occupation
but
they
too
that
two
states
is
the
only
real
path
to
peace
because
just
as
the
people
must
not
be
displaced
the
state
of
israel
is
here
to
stay
so
the
time
is
now
ripe
for
the
entire
international
community
to
get
behind
the
pursuit
of
peace
already
israeli
and
leaders
have
demonstrated
willingness
to
take
significant
political
risks
president
has
put
aside
efforts
to
the
pursuit
of
peace
and
come
to
the
negotiating
table
prime
minister
has
released
prisoners
and
reaffirmed
his
commitment
to
state
current
talks
are
focused
on
final
status
issues
of
borders
and
security
refugees
and
so
now
the
rest
of
us
must
be
willing
to
take
risks
as
well
friends
of
israel
including
the
united
states
must
that
security
as
jewish
and
democratic
state
depends
upon
the
of
state
and
we
should
say
so
clearly
arab
states
and
those
who
supported
the
must
that
stability
will
only
be
served
through
solution
and
secure
israel
all
of
us
must
that
peace
will
be
powerful
tool
to
defeat
extremists
throughout
the
region
and
embolden
those
who
are
prepared
to
build
better
future
and
moreover
ties
of
trade
and
commerce
between
israelis
and
arabs
could
be
an
engine
of
growth
and
opportunity
at
time
when
too
many
young
people
in
the
region
are
languishing
without
work
so
emerge
from
the
familiar
corners
of
blame
and
prejudice
support
israeli
and
leaders
who
are
prepared
to
walk
the
difficult
road
to
peace
real
breakthroughs
on
these
two
issues
nuclear
program
and
peace
would
have
profound
and
positive
impact
on
the
entire
middle
east
and
north
africa
but
the
current
convulsions
arising
out
of
the
arab
spring
remind
us
that
just
and
lasting
peace
can
not
be
measured
only
by
agreements
between
nations
it
must
also
be
measured
by
our
ability
to
resolve
conflict
and
promote
justice
within
nations
and
by
that
measure
clear
that
all
of
us
have
lot
more
work
to
do
when
peaceful
transitions
began
in
tunisia
and
egypt
the
entire
world
was
filled
with
hope
and
although
the
united
states
like
others
was
struck
by
the
speed
of
transition
and
although
we
did
not
and
in
fact
could
not
dictate
events
we
chose
to
support
those
who
called
for
change
and
we
did
so
based
on
the
belief
that
while
these
transitions
will
be
hard
and
take
time
societies
based
upon
democracy
and
openness
and
the
dignity
of
the
individual
will
ultimately
be
more
stable
more
prosperous
and
more
peaceful
over
the
last
few
years
particularly
in
egypt
seen
just
how
hard
this
transition
will
be
was
democratically
elected
but
proved
unwilling
or
unable
to
govern
in
way
that
was
fully
inclusive
the
interim
government
that
replaced
him
responded
to
the
desires
of
millions
of
who
believed
the
revolution
had
taken
wrong
turn
but
it
too
has
made
decisions
inconsistent
with
inclusive
democracy
through
an
emergency
law
and
restrictions
on
the
press
and
civil
society
and
opposition
parties
of
course
america
has
been
attacked
by
all
sides
of
this
internal
conflict
simultaneously
accused
of
supporting
the
muslim
brotherhood
and
engineering
their
removal
of
power
in
fact
the
united
states
has
purposely
avoided
choosing
sides
our
overriding
interest
throughout
these
past
few
years
has
been
to
encourage
government
that
legitimately
reflects
the
will
of
the
egyptian
people
and
true
democracy
as
requiring
respect
for
minority
rights
and
the
rule
of
law
freedom
of
and
assembly
and
strong
civil
society
that
remains
our
interest
today
and
so
going
forward
the
united
states
will
maintain
constructive
relationship
with
the
interim
government
that
promotes
core
interests
like
the
camp
david
accords
and
continue
support
in
areas
like
education
that
directly
benefit
the
egyptian
people
but
we
have
not
proceeded
with
the
delivery
of
certain
military
systems
and
our
support
will
depend
upon
progress
in
pursuing
more
democratic
path
and
our
approach
to
egypt
reflects
larger
point
the
united
states
will
at
times
work
with
governments
that
do
not
meet
at
least
in
our
view
the
highest
international
expectations
but
who
work
with
us
on
our
core
interests
nevertheless
we
will
not
stop
asserting
principles
that
are
consistent
with
our
ideals
whether
that
means
opposing
the
use
of
violence
as
means
of
suppressing
dissent
or
supporting
the
principles
embodied
in
the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
we
will
reject
the
notion
that
these
principles
are
simply
western
exports
incompatible
with
islam
or
the
arab
world
we
believe
they
are
the
birthright
of
every
person
and
while
we
that
our
influence
will
at
times
be
limited
although
we
will
be
wary
of
efforts
to
impose
democracy
through
military
force
and
although
we
will
at
times
be
accused
of
hypocrisy
and
inconsistency
we
will
be
engaged
in
the
region
for
the
long
haul
for
the
hard
work
of
forging
freedom
and
democracy
is
the
task
of
generation
and
this
includes
efforts
to
resolve
sectarian
tensions
that
continue
to
surface
in
places
like
iraq
and
syria
we
understand
such
longstanding
issues
can
not
be
solved
by
outsiders
they
must
be
addressed
by
muslim
communities
themselves
but
seen
grinding
conflicts
come
to
an
end
before
most
recently
in
northern
ireland
where
and
protestants
finally
that
an
endless
cycle
of
conflict
was
causing
both
communities
to
fall
behind
world
and
so
we
believe
those
same
sectarian
conflicts
can
be
overcome
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
to
the
united
states
has
humility
when
it
comes
to
our
ability
to
determine
events
inside
other
countries
the
notion
of
american
empire
may
be
useful
propaganda
but
it
borne
out
by
current
policy
or
by
public
opinion
indeed
as
recent
debates
within
the
united
states
over
syria
clearly
show
the
danger
for
the
world
is
not
an
america
that
is
too
eager
to
immerse
itself
in
the
affairs
of
other
countries
or
to
take
on
every
problem
in
the
region
as
its
own
the
danger
for
the
world
is
that
the
united
states
after
decade
of
war
rightly
concerned
about
issues
back
home
aware
of
the
hostility
that
our
engagement
in
the
region
has
engendered
throughout
the
muslim
world
may
disengage
creating
vacuum
of
leadership
that
no
other
nation
is
ready
to
fill
believe
such
disengagement
would
be
mistake
believe
america
must
remain
engaged
for
our
own
security
but
also
believe
the
world
is
better
for
it
some
may
disagree
but
believe
america
is
exceptional
in
part
because
we
have
shown
willingness
through
the
sacrifice
of
blood
and
treasure
to
stand
up
not
only
for
our
own
narrow
but
for
the
interests
of
all
must
be
honest
though
we
far
more
likely
to
invest
our
energy
in
those
countries
that
want
to
work
with
us
that
invest
in
their
people
instead
of
corrupt
few
that
embrace
vision
of
society
where
everyone
can
contribute
men
and
women
or
muslim
christian
or
jew
because
from
europe
to
asia
from
africa
to
the
nations
that
have
persevered
on
democratic
path
have
emerged
more
prosperous
more
peaceful
and
more
invested
in
upholding
our
common
security
and
our
common
humanity
and
believe
that
the
same
will
hold
true
for
the
arab
world
this
leads
me
to
final
point
there
will
be
times
when
the
breakdown
of
societies
is
so
great
the
violence
against
civilians
so
substantial
that
the
international
community
will
be
called
upon
to
act
this
will
require
new
thinking
and
some
very
tough
choices
while
the
united
nations
was
designed
to
prevent
wars
between
states
increasingly
we
face
the
challenge
of
preventing
slaughter
within
states
and
these
challenges
will
grow
more
pronounced
as
we
are
confronted
with
states
that
are
fragile
or
failing
places
where
horrendous
violence
can
put
innocent
men
women
and
children
at
risk
with
no
hope
of
protection
from
their
national
institutions
have
made
it
clear
that
even
when
core
interests
are
not
directly
threatened
we
stand
ready
to
do
our
part
to
prevent
mass
atrocities
and
protect
basic
human
rights
but
we
can
not
and
should
not
bear
that
burden
alone
in
we
supported
both
the
french
intervention
that
successfully
pushed
back
and
the
african
forces
who
are
keeping
the
peace
in
eastern
africa
we
are
working
with
partners
to
bring
the
resistance
army
to
an
end
and
in
libya
when
the
security
council
provided
mandate
to
protect
civilians
america
joined
coalition
that
took
action
because
of
what
we
did
there
countless
lives
were
saved
and
tyrant
could
not
kill
his
way
back
to
power
know
that
some
now
the
action
in
libya
as
an
object
lesson
they
point
to
the
problems
that
the
country
now
confronts
democratically
elected
government
struggling
to
provide
security
armed
groups
in
some
places
extremists
ruling
parts
of
fractured
land
and
so
these
critics
argue
that
any
intervention
to
protect
civilians
is
doomed
to
fail
look
at
libya
no
one
is
more
mindful
of
these
problems
than
am
for
they
resulted
in
the
death
of
four
outstanding
citizens
who
were
committed
to
the
libyan
people
including
ambassador
man
whose
courageous
efforts
helped
save
the
city
of
but
does
anyone
truly
believe
that
the
situation
in
libya
would
be
better
if
had
been
allowed
to
kill
imprison
or
his
people
into
submission
far
more
likely
that
without
international
action
libya
would
now
be
engulfed
in
civil
war
and
bloodshed
we
live
in
world
of
imperfect
choices
different
nations
will
not
agree
on
the
need
for
action
in
every
instance
and
the
principle
of
sovereignty
is
at
the
of
our
international
order
but
sovereignty
can
not
be
shield
for
tyrants
to
commit
wanton
murder
or
an
excuse
for
the
international
community
to
turn
blind
eye
while
we
need
to
be
modest
in
our
belief
that
we
can
remedy
every
evil
while
we
need
to
be
mindful
that
the
world
is
full
of
unintended
consequences
should
we
really
accept
the
notion
that
the
world
is
powerless
in
the
face
of
rwanda
or
if
the
world
that
people
want
to
live
in
they
should
say
so
and
reckon
with
the
cold
logic
of
mass
graves
but
believe
we
can
embrace
different
future
and
if
we
want
to
choose
between
inaction
and
war
we
must
get
better
all
of
us
at
the
policies
that
prevent
the
breakdown
of
basic
order
through
respect
for
the
responsibilities
of
nations
and
the
rights
of
individuals
through
meaningful
sanctions
for
those
who
break
the
rules
through
dogged
diplomacy
that
resolves
the
root
causes
of
conflict
not
merely
its
aftermath
through
development
assistance
that
brings
hope
to
the
and
yes
sometimes
although
this
will
not
be
enough
there
are
going
to
be
moments
where
the
international
community
will
need
to
acknowledge
that
the
multilateral
use
of
military
force
may
be
required
to
prevent
the
very
worst
from
occurring
ultimately
this
is
the
international
community
that
america
seeks
one
where
nations
do
not
covet
the
land
or
resources
of
other
nations
but
one
in
which
we
carry
out
the
founding
purpose
of
this
institution
and
where
we
all
take
responsibility
world
in
which
the
rules
established
out
of
the
horrors
of
war
can
help
us
resolve
conflicts
peacefully
and
prevent
the
kinds
of
wars
that
our
forefathers
fought
world
where
human
beings
can
live
with
dignity
and
meet
their
basic
needs
whether
they
live
in
new
york
or
nairobi
in
or
damascus
these
are
extraordinary
times
with
extraordinary
opportunities
thanks
to
human
progress
child
born
anywhere
on
earth
today
can
do
things
today
that
years
ago
would
have
been
out
of
reach
for
the
mass
of
humanity
saw
this
in
africa
where
nations
moving
beyond
conflict
are
now
poised
to
take
off
and
america
is
with
them
partnering
to
feed
the
hungry
and
care
for
the
sick
and
to
bring
power
to
places
off
the
grid
see
it
across
the
pacific
region
where
hundreds
of
millions
have
been
lifted
out
of
poverty
in
single
generation
see
it
in
the
faces
of
young
people
everywhere
who
can
access
the
entire
world
with
the
click
of
button
and
who
are
eager
to
join
the
cause
of
eradicating
extreme
poverty
and
combating
climate
change
starting
businesses
expanding
freedom
and
leaving
behind
the
old
ideological
battles
of
the
past
happening
in
asia
and
africa
happening
in
europe
and
across
the
the
future
that
the
people
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
deserve
as
well
one
where
they
can
focus
on
opportunity
instead
of
whether
be
killed
or
repressed
because
of
who
they
are
or
what
they
believe
time
and
again
nations
and
people
have
shown
our
capacity
to
change
to
live
up
to
highest
ideals
to
choose
our
better
history
last
month
stood
where
years
ago
martin
luther
king
told
america
about
his
dream
at
time
when
many
people
of
my
race
could
not
even
vote
for
president
earlier
this
year
stood
in
the
small
cell
where
mandela
endured
decades
cut
off
from
his
own
people
and
the
world
who
are
we
to
believe
that
challenges
can
not
be
overcome
when
we
have
seen
what
changes
the
human
spirit
can
bring
who
in
this
hall
can
argue
that
the
future
belongs
to
those
who
seek
to
repress
that
spirit
rather
than
those
who
seek
to
liberate
it
know
what
side
of
history
want
to
the
united
states
of
america
to
be
on
we
ready
to
meet
challenges
with
you
firm
in
the
belief
that
all
men
and
women
are
in
fact
created
equal
each
individual
possessed
with
dignity
and
inalienable
rights
that
can
not
be
denied
that
is
why
we
look
to
the
future
not
with
fear
but
with
hope
and
why
we
remain
convinced
that
this
community
of
nations
can
deliver
more
peaceful
prosperous
and
just
world
to
the
next
generation
thank
you
very
much
secretary
secretary
admirals
and
mayor
leaders
from
across
this
city
and
our
armed
forces
to
all
the
outstanding
first
responders
and
most
of
all
the
families
whose
hearts
have
been
broken
we
can
not
begin
to
comprehend
your
loss
we
know
that
no
words
we
offer
today
are
equal
to
the
magnitude
to
the
depths
of
that
loss
but
we
come
together
as
grateful
nation
to
your
loved
ones
to
grieve
with
you
and
to
offer
as
best
we
can
some
solace
and
comfort
on
the
night
that
we
lost
martin
luther
king
to
gunman
bullet
kennedy
stood
before
stunned
and
angry
crowd
in
and
he
broke
the
terrible
news
and
in
the
anguish
of
that
moment
he
turned
to
the
words
of
an
ancient
greek
poet
even
in
our
sleep
pain
which
can
not
forget
falls
drop
by
drop
upon
the
heart
until
in
our
own
despair
against
our
will
comes
wisdom
through
the
awful
grace
of
god
pain
which
can
not
forget
drop
by
drop
upon
the
heart
the
tragedy
and
the
pain
that
brings
us
here
today
is
extraordinary
it
is
unique
the
lives
that
were
taken
from
us
were
unique
the
memories
their
loved
ones
carry
are
unique
and
they
will
carry
them
and
endure
long
after
the
news
cameras
are
gone
but
part
of
what
wears
on
as
well
is
the
sense
that
this
has
happened
before
part
of
what
wears
on
us
what
troubles
us
so
deeply
as
we
gather
here
today
is
how
this
senseless
violence
that
took
place
in
the
navy
yard
other
recent
tragedies
as
president
have
now
grieved
with
five
american
communities
ripped
apart
by
mass
violence
fort
hood
aurora
sandy
hook
and
now
the
washington
navy
yard
and
these
mass
shootings
occur
against
backdrop
of
daily
tragedies
as
an
epidemic
of
gun
violence
tears
apart
communities
across
america
from
the
streets
of
chicago
to
not
far
from
here
and
so
once
again
we
remember
our
fellow
americans
who
were
just
going
about
their
day
doing
their
jobs
doing
what
they
loved
in
this
case
the
unheralded
work
that
keeps
our
country
strong
and
our
navy
the
finest
fleet
in
the
world
these
patriots
doing
their
work
that
they
were
so
proud
of
and
who
have
now
been
taken
away
from
us
by
unspeakable
violence
once
more
we
come
together
to
mourn
the
lives
of
beauty
and
to
comfort
the
wonderful
families
who
cherished
them
once
more
we
pay
tribute
to
all
who
rushed
towards
the
danger
who
risked
their
lives
so
others
might
live
and
who
are
in
our
prayers
today
including
officer
once
more
our
hearts
are
broken
once
more
we
ask
why
once
more
we
seek
strength
and
wisdom
through
god
grace
you
and
your
families
this
navy
family
are
still
in
the
early
hour
of
your
grief
and
here
today
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
routine
about
this
tragedy
there
is
nothing
routine
about
your
loss
your
loved
ones
will
not
be
forgotten
they
will
endure
in
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
and
in
the
hearts
of
the
navy
that
they
helped
to
keep
strong
and
the
hearts
of
their
coworkers
and
their
friends
and
their
want
them
to
know
how
she
lived
said
of
her
mother
she
is
not
number
or
some
statistic
none
of
these
fellow
americans
are
statistics
today
want
every
american
to
see
how
these
men
and
women
lived
you
may
have
never
met
them
but
you
know
them
they
your
like
arthur
out
there
on
the
weekend
polishing
his
white
crown
victoria
and
proctor
with
his
beloved
yellow
mustang
who
if
you
asked
would
fix
your
car
too
she
was
the
friendly
face
at
the
store
with
her
unforgettable
gold
hair
who
took
second
job
at
because
she
said
she
just
loved
working
with
people
she
was
the
diehard
fan
you
sat
next
to
at
the
game
loved
her
hockey
and
her
caps
season
ticket
holder
for
years
they
were
the
volunteers
who
made
your
community
better
frank
giving
dictionaries
to
every
in
his
county
leading
the
children
bible
study
at
church
they
lived
the
american
dream
like
who
left
everything
he
knew
in
india
for
this
land
of
opportunity
and
raised
wonderful
family
and
dedicated
himself
to
the
united
states
navy
they
were
proud
veterans
like
read
who
wore
the
army
uniform
for
more
than
years
and
who
became
one
of
the
navy
leading
architects
of
whom
colleague
said
nobody
knew
those
ships
like
him
they
were
dedicated
fathers
like
mike
coaching
his
daughter
softball
teams
joining
just
to
keep
up
with
his
girls
one
of
whom
said
he
was
always
the
cool
dad
they
were
loving
mothers
like
mary
knight
devoted
to
her
daughters
and
who
had
just
recently
watched
with
joy
as
her
older
daughter
got
married
they
were
doting
grandparents
like
john
always
smiling
giving
bear
hugs
to
his
grandchildren
and
who
would
have
welcomed
his
grandchild
this
fall
these
are
not
statistics
they
are
the
lives
that
have
been
taken
from
us
this
is
how
far
single
act
of
violence
can
ripple
husband
has
lost
his
wife
wives
have
lost
their
husbands
sons
and
daughters
have
lost
their
moms
and
their
dads
little
children
have
lost
their
grandparents
hundreds
in
our
communities
have
lost
and
thousands
here
have
lost
friend
as
has
been
mentioned
for
one
family
the
family
old
wounds
are
ripped
open
again
has
lost
arthur
her
husband
of
years
only
few
years
ago
as
mayor
indicated
another
shooting
took
the
life
of
their
son
just
years
old
believe
this
is
happening
again
says
so
these
families
have
endured
shattering
tragedy
it
ought
to
be
shock
to
us
all
as
nation
and
as
people
it
ought
to
obsess
us
it
ought
to
lead
to
some
sort
of
transformation
that
what
happened
in
other
countries
when
they
experienced
similar
tragedies
in
the
united
kingdom
in
when
just
single
mass
shooting
occurred
in
those
countries
they
understood
that
there
was
nothing
ordinary
about
this
kind
of
carnage
they
endured
great
heartbreak
but
they
also
and
they
changed
and
mass
shootings
became
great
rarity
and
yet
here
in
the
united
states
after
the
coverage
on
cable
news
after
the
heartbreaking
interviews
with
families
after
all
the
speeches
and
all
the
and
all
the
commentary
nothing
happens
alongside
the
anguish
of
these
american
families
alongside
the
accumulated
outrage
so
many
of
us
feel
sometimes
fear
there
creeping
resignation
that
these
tragedies
are
just
somehow
the
way
it
is
that
this
is
somehow
the
new
normal
we
accept
this
as
americans
bound
in
grief
and
love
we
must
insist
here
today
there
is
nothing
normal
about
innocent
men
and
women
being
gunned
down
where
they
work
there
is
nothing
normal
about
our
children
being
gunned
down
in
their
classrooms
there
is
nothing
normal
about
children
dying
in
our
streets
from
stray
bullets
no
other
advanced
nation
endures
this
kind
of
violence
none
here
in
america
the
murder
rate
is
three
times
what
it
is
in
other
developed
nations
the
murder
rate
with
guns
is
ten
times
what
it
is
in
other
developed
nations
and
there
is
nothing
inevitable
about
it
it
comes
about
because
of
decisions
we
make
or
fail
to
make
and
it
falls
upon
us
to
make
it
different
sometimes
it
takes
an
unexpected
voice
to
break
through
to
help
remind
us
what
we
know
to
be
true
and
we
heard
one
of
those
voices
last
week
team
at
washington
hospital
treated
the
wounded
and
in
the
midst
of
one
of
her
briefings
she
spoke
with
heartbreaking
honesty
as
somebody
who
sees
daily
and
nightly
the
awful
carnage
of
so
much
violence
we
are
great
country
she
said
but
there
something
wrong
all
these
shootings
all
these
victims
she
said
this
is
not
america
it
is
challenge
to
all
of
us
she
said
and
we
have
to
work
together
to
get
rid
of
this
and
that
the
wisdom
we
should
be
taking
away
from
this
tragedy
and
so
many
others
not
accepting
these
shootings
as
inevitable
but
asking
what
can
we
do
to
prevent
them
from
happening
again
and
again
and
again
said
before
we
can
not
stop
every
act
of
senseless
violence
we
can
not
know
every
evil
that
lurks
in
troubled
minds
but
if
we
can
prevent
even
one
tragedy
like
this
save
even
one
life
spare
other
families
what
these
families
are
going
through
surely
we
got
an
obligation
to
try
it
true
that
each
of
the
tragedies
mentioned
is
different
and
in
this
case
it
clear
we
need
to
do
better
job
of
securing
our
military
facilities
and
deciding
who
gets
access
to
them
and
as
commander
in
chief
have
ordered
review
of
procedures
up
and
down
the
chain
and
know
that
secretary
is
moving
aggressively
on
that
as
society
it
clear
we
got
to
do
better
job
of
ensuring
that
those
who
need
mental
health
care
actually
get
it
and
that
in
those
efforts
we
do
those
who
need
help
those
things
are
clear
and
we
got
to
move
to
address
them
but
we
americans
are
not
an
inherently
more
violent
people
than
folks
in
other
countries
we
not
inherently
more
prone
to
mental
health
problems
the
main
difference
that
sets
our
nation
apart
what
makes
us
so
susceptible
to
so
many
mass
shootings
is
that
we
do
do
enough
we
do
take
the
basic
actions
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
and
dangerous
people
what
different
in
america
is
it
easy
to
get
your
hands
on
gun
and
lot
of
us
know
this
but
the
politics
are
difficult
as
we
saw
again
this
spring
and
that
sometimes
where
the
resignation
comes
from
the
sense
that
our
politics
are
frozen
and
that
nothing
will
change
well
can
not
accept
that
do
not
accept
that
we
can
not
find
way
to
preserve
our
traditions
including
our
basic
second
amendment
freedoms
and
the
rights
of
gun
owners
while
at
the
same
time
reducing
the
gun
violence
that
unleashes
so
much
mayhem
on
regular
basis
and
it
may
not
happen
tomorrow
and
it
may
not
happen
next
week
it
may
not
happen
next
month
but
it
will
happen
because
it
the
change
that
we
need
and
it
change
overwhelmingly
supported
by
the
majority
of
americans
by
now
though
it
should
be
clear
that
the
change
we
need
will
not
come
from
washington
even
when
tragedy
strikes
washington
change
will
come
the
only
way
it
ever
has
come
and
that
from
the
american
people
so
the
question
now
is
not
whether
as
americans
we
care
in
moments
of
tragedy
clearly
we
care
our
hearts
are
broken
again
and
we
care
so
deeply
about
these
families
but
the
question
is
do
we
care
enough
do
we
care
enough
to
keep
standing
up
for
the
country
that
we
know
is
possible
even
if
it
hard
and
even
if
it
politically
uncomfortable
do
we
care
enough
to
sustain
the
passion
and
the
pressure
to
make
our
communities
safer
and
our
country
safer
do
we
care
enough
to
do
everything
we
can
to
spare
other
families
the
pain
that
is
felt
here
today
our
tears
are
not
enough
our
words
and
our
prayers
are
not
enough
if
we
really
want
to
these
men
and
women
if
we
really
want
to
be
country
where
we
can
go
to
work
and
go
to
school
and
walk
our
streets
free
from
senseless
violence
without
so
many
lives
being
stolen
by
bullet
from
gun
then
we
going
to
have
to
change
we
going
to
have
to
change
on
monday
morning
these
men
and
women
woke
up
like
they
did
every
day
they
left
home
and
they
headed
off
to
work
read
wife
said
see
you
tonight
for
dinner
and
john
looked
at
his
wife
and
said
what
he
always
said
whenever
they
parted
goodbye
beautiful
love
you
so
much
even
in
our
sleep
pain
which
can
not
forget
falls
drop
by
drop
upon
the
heart
until
in
our
own
despair
against
our
will
comes
wisdom
through
the
awful
grace
of
god
what
kennedy
understood
what
king
understood
what
all
our
great
leaders
have
always
understood
is
that
wisdom
does
not
come
from
tragedy
alone
or
from
some
sense
of
resignation
in
the
fallibility
of
man
wisdom
comes
through
the
recognition
that
tragedies
such
as
this
are
not
inevitable
and
that
we
possess
the
ability
to
act
and
to
change
and
to
spare
others
the
pain
that
drops
upon
our
hearts
so
in
our
grief
let
us
seek
that
grace
let
us
find
that
wisdom
and
in
doing
so
let
us
truly
these
american
patriots
may
god
hold
close
the
souls
taken
from
us
and
grant
them
eternal
peace
may
he
comfort
and
watch
over
these
families
and
may
god
grant
us
the
strength
and
the
wisdom
to
keep
safe
our
united
states
of
america
my
fellow
americans
tonight
want
to
talk
to
you
about
syria
why
it
matters
and
where
we
go
from
here
over
the
past
two
years
what
began
as
series
of
peaceful
protests
against
the
repressive
regime
of
has
turned
into
brutal
civil
war
over
people
have
been
killed
millions
have
fled
the
country
in
that
time
america
has
worked
with
allies
to
provide
humanitarian
support
to
help
the
moderate
opposition
and
to
shape
political
settlement
but
have
resisted
calls
for
military
action
because
we
can
not
resolve
someone
civil
war
through
force
particularly
after
decade
of
war
in
iraq
and
the
situation
profoundly
changed
though
on
august
when
government
gassed
to
death
over
thousand
people
including
hundreds
of
children
the
images
from
this
massacre
are
sickening
men
women
children
lying
in
rows
killed
by
poison
gas
others
foaming
at
the
mouth
gasping
for
breath
father
clutching
his
dead
children
imploring
them
to
get
up
and
walk
on
that
terrible
night
the
world
saw
in
gruesome
detail
the
terrible
nature
of
chemical
weapons
and
why
the
overwhelming
majority
of
humanity
has
declared
them
crime
against
humanity
and
violation
of
the
laws
of
war
this
was
not
always
the
case
in
world
war
american
were
among
the
many
thousands
killed
by
deadly
gas
in
the
trenches
of
europe
in
world
war
the
nazis
used
gas
to
inflict
the
horror
of
the
holocaust
because
these
weapons
can
kill
on
mass
scale
with
no
distinction
between
soldier
and
infant
the
world
has
spent
century
working
to
ban
them
and
in
the
united
states
senate
overwhelmingly
approved
an
international
agreement
prohibiting
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
now
joined
by
governments
that
represent
percent
of
humanity
on
august
these
basic
rules
were
violated
along
with
our
sense
of
common
humanity
no
one
disputes
that
chemical
weapons
were
used
in
syria
the
world
saw
thousands
of
videos
cell
phone
pictures
and
social
media
accounts
from
the
attack
and
humanitarian
told
stories
of
hospitals
packed
with
people
who
had
symptoms
of
poison
gas
moreover
we
know
the
regime
was
responsible
in
the
days
leading
up
to
august
we
know
that
chemical
weapons
personnel
prepared
for
an
attack
near
an
area
where
they
mix
gas
they
distributed
to
their
troops
then
they
fired
rockets
from
area
into
that
the
regime
has
been
trying
to
wipe
clear
of
opposition
forces
shortly
after
those
rockets
landed
the
gas
spread
and
hospitals
filled
with
the
dying
and
the
wounded
we
know
senior
figures
in
military
machine
reviewed
the
results
of
the
attack
and
the
regime
increased
their
shelling
of
the
same
in
the
days
that
followed
also
studied
samples
of
blood
and
hair
from
people
at
the
site
that
tested
positive
for
when
dictators
commit
atrocities
they
depend
upon
the
world
to
look
the
other
way
until
those
horrifying
pictures
fade
from
memory
but
these
things
happened
the
facts
can
not
be
denied
the
question
now
is
what
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
international
community
is
prepared
to
do
about
it
because
what
happened
to
those
people
to
those
children
is
not
only
violation
of
international
law
also
danger
to
our
security
let
me
explain
why
if
we
fail
to
act
the
regime
will
see
no
reason
to
stop
using
chemical
weapons
as
the
ban
against
these
weapons
erodes
other
tyrants
will
have
no
reason
to
think
twice
about
acquiring
poison
gas
and
using
them
over
time
our
troops
would
again
face
the
prospect
of
chemical
warfare
on
the
battlefield
and
it
could
be
easier
for
terrorist
to
obtain
these
weapons
and
to
use
them
to
attack
civilians
if
fighting
spills
beyond
borders
these
weapons
could
threaten
allies
like
turkey
and
israel
and
failure
to
stand
against
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
would
weaken
prohibitions
against
other
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
embolden
ally
iran
which
must
decide
whether
to
ignore
international
law
by
building
nuclear
weapon
or
to
take
more
peaceful
path
this
is
not
world
we
should
accept
this
is
at
stake
and
that
is
why
after
careful
deliberation
determined
that
it
is
in
the
national
security
interests
of
the
united
states
to
respond
to
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
through
targeted
military
strike
the
purpose
of
this
strike
would
be
to
deter
from
using
chemical
weapons
to
degrade
his
ability
to
use
them
and
to
make
clear
to
the
world
that
we
will
not
tolerate
their
use
that
my
judgment
as
but
also
the
president
of
the
oldest
constitutional
democracy
so
even
though
possess
the
authority
to
order
military
strikes
believed
it
was
right
in
the
absence
of
direct
or
imminent
threat
to
our
security
to
take
this
debate
to
congress
believe
our
democracy
is
stronger
when
the
president
acts
with
the
support
of
congress
and
believe
that
america
acts
more
effectively
abroad
when
we
stand
together
this
is
especially
true
after
decade
that
put
more
and
more
power
in
the
hands
of
the
president
and
more
and
more
burdens
on
the
shoulders
of
our
troops
while
the
representatives
from
the
critical
decisions
about
when
we
use
force
now
know
that
after
the
terrible
toll
of
iraq
and
the
idea
of
any
military
action
no
matter
how
limited
is
not
going
to
be
popular
after
all
spent
four
and
half
years
working
to
end
wars
not
to
start
them
our
troops
are
out
of
iraq
our
troops
are
coming
home
from
and
know
americans
want
all
of
us
in
washington
especially
me
to
concentrate
on
the
task
of
building
our
nation
here
at
home
putting
people
back
to
work
educating
our
kids
growing
our
middle
class
no
wonder
then
that
you
asking
hard
questions
so
let
me
answer
some
of
the
most
important
questions
that
heard
from
members
of
congress
and
that
read
in
letters
that
you
sent
to
me
first
many
of
you
have
asked
this
put
us
on
slippery
slope
to
another
war
one
man
wrote
to
me
that
we
are
recovering
from
our
involvement
in
veteran
put
it
more
bluntly
nation
is
sick
and
tired
of
my
answer
is
simple
will
not
put
american
boots
on
the
ground
in
syria
will
not
pursue
an
action
like
iraq
or
will
not
pursue
prolonged
air
campaign
like
libya
or
this
would
be
targeted
strike
to
achieve
clear
objective
deterring
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
and
degrading
capabilities
others
have
asked
whether
it
worth
acting
if
we
take
out
as
some
members
of
congress
have
said
no
point
in
simply
doing
strike
in
syria
let
me
make
something
clear
the
united
states
military
do
pinpricks
even
limited
strike
will
send
message
to
that
no
other
nation
can
deliver
do
think
we
should
remove
another
dictator
with
force
we
learned
from
iraq
that
doing
so
makes
us
responsible
for
all
that
comes
next
but
targeted
strike
can
make
or
any
other
dictator
think
twice
before
using
chemical
weapons
other
questions
involve
the
dangers
of
retaliation
we
dismiss
any
threats
but
the
regime
does
not
have
the
ability
to
seriously
threaten
our
military
any
other
retaliation
they
might
seek
is
in
line
with
threats
that
we
face
every
day
neither
nor
his
allies
have
any
interest
in
escalation
that
would
lead
to
his
demise
and
our
ally
israel
can
defend
itself
with
overwhelming
force
as
well
as
the
unshakeable
support
of
the
united
states
of
america
many
of
you
have
asked
broader
question
why
should
we
get
involved
at
all
in
place
that
so
complicated
and
where
as
one
person
wrote
to
me
who
come
after
may
be
enemies
of
human
rights
true
that
some
of
opponents
are
extremists
but
will
only
draw
strength
in
more
chaotic
syria
if
people
there
see
the
world
doing
nothing
to
prevent
innocent
civilians
from
being
gassed
to
death
the
majority
of
the
syrian
people
and
the
syrian
opposition
we
work
with
just
want
to
live
in
peace
with
dignity
and
freedom
and
the
day
after
any
military
action
we
would
redouble
our
efforts
to
achieve
political
solution
that
strengthens
those
who
reject
the
forces
of
tyranny
and
extremism
finally
many
of
you
have
asked
why
not
leave
this
to
other
countries
or
seek
solutions
short
of
force
as
several
people
wrote
to
me
should
not
be
the
agree
and
have
deeply
held
preference
for
peaceful
solutions
over
the
last
two
years
my
administration
has
tried
diplomacy
and
sanctions
warning
and
negotiations
but
chemical
weapons
were
still
used
by
the
regime
however
over
the
last
few
days
seen
some
encouraging
signs
in
part
because
of
the
credible
threat
of
military
action
as
well
as
constructive
talks
that
had
with
president
the
russian
government
has
indicated
willingness
to
join
with
the
international
community
in
pushing
to
give
up
his
chemical
weapons
the
regime
has
now
admitted
that
it
has
these
weapons
and
even
said
join
the
chemical
weapons
convention
which
prohibits
their
use
too
early
to
tell
whether
this
offer
will
succeed
and
any
agreement
must
verify
that
the
regime
keeps
its
commitments
but
this
initiative
has
the
potential
to
remove
the
threat
of
chemical
weapons
without
the
use
of
force
particularly
because
russia
is
one
of
strongest
allies
have
therefore
asked
the
leaders
of
congress
to
postpone
vote
to
the
use
of
force
while
we
pursue
this
diplomatic
path
sending
secretary
of
state
john
to
meet
his
russian
counterpart
on
thursday
and
will
continue
my
own
discussions
with
president
spoken
to
the
leaders
of
two
of
our
closest
allies
france
and
the
united
kingdom
and
we
will
work
together
in
consultation
with
russia
and
china
to
put
forward
resolution
at
the
security
council
requiring
to
give
up
his
chemical
weapons
and
to
ultimately
destroy
them
under
international
control
also
give
inspectors
the
opportunity
to
report
their
findings
about
what
happened
on
august
and
we
will
continue
to
rally
support
from
allies
from
europe
to
the
from
asia
to
the
middle
east
who
agree
on
the
need
for
action
meanwhile
ordered
our
military
to
maintain
their
current
posture
to
keep
the
pressure
on
and
to
be
in
position
to
respond
if
diplomacy
fails
and
tonight
give
thanks
again
to
our
military
and
their
families
for
their
incredible
strength
and
sacrifices
my
fellow
americans
for
nearly
seven
decades
the
united
states
has
been
the
anchor
of
global
security
this
has
meant
doing
more
than
forging
international
agreements
it
has
meant
enforcing
them
the
burdens
of
leadership
are
often
heavy
but
the
world
is
better
place
because
we
have
borne
them
and
so
to
my
friends
on
the
right
ask
you
to
reconcile
your
commitment
to
military
might
with
failure
to
act
when
cause
is
so
plainly
just
to
my
friends
on
the
left
ask
you
to
reconcile
your
belief
in
freedom
and
dignity
for
all
people
with
those
images
of
children
writhing
in
pain
and
going
still
on
cold
hospital
floor
for
sometimes
resolutions
and
statements
of
condemnation
are
simply
not
enough
indeed
ask
every
member
of
congress
and
those
of
you
watching
at
home
tonight
to
view
those
videos
of
the
attack
and
then
ask
what
kind
of
world
will
we
live
in
if
the
united
states
of
america
sees
dictator
brazenly
violate
international
law
with
poison
gas
and
we
choose
to
look
the
other
way
once
said
national
determination
to
keep
free
of
foreign
wars
and
foreign
entanglements
can
not
prevent
us
from
feeling
deep
concern
when
ideals
and
principles
that
we
have
cherished
are
our
ideals
and
principles
as
well
as
our
national
security
are
at
stake
in
syria
along
with
our
leadership
of
world
where
we
seek
to
ensure
that
the
worst
weapons
will
never
be
used
america
is
not
the
policeman
terrible
things
happen
across
the
globe
and
it
is
beyond
our
means
to
right
every
wrong
but
when
with
modest
effort
and
risk
we
can
stop
children
from
being
gassed
to
death
and
thereby
make
our
own
children
safer
over
the
long
run
believe
we
should
act
what
makes
america
different
what
makes
us
exceptional
with
humility
but
with
resolve
let
us
never
lose
sight
of
that
essential
truth
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
ten
days
ago
the
world
watched
in
horror
as
men
women
and
children
were
massacred
in
syria
in
the
worst
chemical
weapons
attack
of
the
century
yesterday
the
united
states
presented
powerful
case
that
the
syrian
government
was
responsible
for
this
attack
on
its
own
people
our
intelligence
shows
the
regime
and
its
forces
preparing
to
use
chemical
weapons
launching
rockets
in
the
highly
populated
suburbs
of
damascus
and
acknowledging
that
chemical
weapons
attack
took
place
and
all
of
this
corroborates
what
the
world
can
plainly
see
hospitals
overflowing
with
victims
terrible
images
of
the
dead
all
told
well
over
people
were
murdered
several
hundred
of
them
were
children
young
girls
and
boys
gassed
to
death
by
their
own
government
this
attack
is
an
assault
on
human
dignity
it
also
presents
serious
danger
to
our
national
security
it
risks
making
mockery
of
the
global
prohibition
on
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
it
endangers
our
friends
and
our
partners
along
syria
borders
including
israel
turkey
lebanon
and
iraq
it
could
lead
to
escalating
use
of
chemical
weapons
or
their
proliferation
to
terrorist
groups
who
would
do
our
people
harm
in
world
with
many
dangers
this
menace
must
be
confronted
now
after
careful
deliberation
have
decided
that
the
united
states
should
take
military
action
against
syrian
regime
targets
this
would
not
be
an
intervention
we
would
not
put
boots
on
the
ground
instead
our
action
would
be
designed
to
be
limited
in
duration
and
scope
but
confident
we
can
hold
the
regime
accountable
for
their
use
of
chemical
weapons
deter
this
kind
of
and
degrade
their
capacity
to
carry
it
out
our
military
has
positioned
assets
in
the
region
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
has
informed
me
that
we
are
prepared
to
strike
whenever
we
choose
moreover
the
chairman
has
indicated
to
me
that
our
capacity
to
execute
this
mission
is
not
it
will
be
effective
tomorrow
or
next
week
or
one
month
from
now
and
prepared
to
give
that
order
but
having
made
my
decision
as
based
on
what
am
convinced
is
our
national
security
interests
also
mindful
that
the
president
of
the
world
oldest
constitutional
democracy
long
believed
that
our
power
is
rooted
not
just
in
our
military
might
but
in
our
example
as
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
and
that
why
made
second
decision
will
seek
for
the
use
of
force
from
the
american
people
representatives
in
congress
over
the
last
several
days
we
heard
from
members
of
congress
who
want
their
voices
to
be
heard
absolutely
agree
so
this
morning
spoke
with
all
four
congressional
leaders
and
they
agreed
to
schedule
debate
and
then
vote
as
soon
as
congress
comes
back
into
session
in
the
coming
days
my
administration
stands
ready
to
provide
every
member
with
the
information
they
need
to
understand
what
happened
in
syria
and
why
it
has
such
profound
implications
for
america
national
security
and
all
of
us
should
be
accountable
as
we
move
forward
and
that
can
only
be
accomplished
with
vote
confident
in
the
case
our
government
has
made
without
waiting
for
inspectors
comfortable
going
forward
without
the
approval
of
united
nations
security
council
that
so
far
has
been
completely
and
unwilling
to
hold
accountable
as
consequence
many
people
have
advised
against
taking
this
decision
to
congress
and
undoubtedly
they
were
impacted
by
what
we
saw
happen
in
the
united
kingdom
this
week
when
the
parliament
of
our
closest
ally
failed
to
pass
resolution
with
similar
goal
even
as
the
prime
minister
supported
taking
action
yet
while
believe
have
the
authority
to
carry
out
this
military
action
without
specific
congressional
know
that
the
country
will
be
stronger
if
we
take
this
course
and
our
actions
will
be
even
more
effective
we
should
have
this
debate
because
the
issues
are
too
big
for
business
as
usual
and
this
morning
john
harry
and
agreed
that
this
is
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
democracy
country
faces
few
decisions
as
grave
as
using
military
force
even
when
that
force
is
limited
respect
the
views
of
those
who
call
for
caution
particularly
as
our
country
emerges
from
time
of
war
that
was
elected
in
part
to
end
but
if
we
really
do
want
to
turn
away
from
taking
appropriate
action
in
the
face
of
such
an
unspeakable
outrage
then
we
must
acknowledge
the
costs
of
doing
nothing
here
my
question
for
every
member
of
congress
and
every
member
of
the
global
community
what
message
will
we
send
if
dictator
can
gas
hundreds
of
children
to
death
in
plain
sight
and
pay
no
price
what
the
purpose
of
the
international
system
that
we
built
if
prohibition
on
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
that
has
been
agreed
to
by
the
governments
of
percent
of
the
world
people
and
approved
overwhelmingly
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
not
enforced
make
no
mistake
this
has
implications
beyond
chemical
warfare
if
we
enforce
accountability
in
the
face
of
this
heinous
act
what
does
it
say
about
our
resolve
to
stand
up
to
others
who
flout
fundamental
international
rules
to
governments
who
would
choose
to
build
nuclear
arms
to
terrorist
who
would
spread
biological
weapons
to
armies
who
carry
out
genocide
we
can
not
raise
our
children
in
world
where
we
will
not
follow
through
on
the
things
we
say
the
accords
we
sign
the
values
that
define
us
so
just
as
will
take
this
case
to
congress
will
also
deliver
this
message
to
the
world
while
the
investigation
has
some
time
to
report
on
its
findings
we
will
insist
that
an
atrocity
committed
with
chemical
weapons
is
not
simply
investigated
it
must
be
confronted
do
expect
every
nation
to
agree
with
the
decision
we
have
made
privately
we
heard
many
expressions
of
support
from
our
friends
but
will
ask
those
who
care
about
the
writ
of
the
international
community
to
stand
publicly
behind
our
action
and
finally
let
me
say
this
to
the
american
people
know
well
that
we
are
weary
of
war
we
ended
one
war
in
iraq
we
ending
another
in
and
the
american
people
have
the
good
sense
to
know
we
can
not
resolve
the
underlying
conflict
in
syria
with
our
military
in
that
part
of
the
world
there
are
ancient
sectarian
differences
and
the
hopes
of
the
arab
spring
have
unleashed
forces
of
change
that
are
going
to
take
many
years
to
resolve
and
that
why
we
not
contemplating
putting
our
troops
in
the
middle
of
someone
else
war
instead
we
continue
to
support
the
syrian
people
through
our
pressure
on
the
regime
our
commitment
to
the
opposition
our
care
for
the
displaced
and
our
pursuit
of
political
resolution
that
achieves
government
that
respects
the
dignity
of
its
people
but
we
are
the
united
states
of
america
and
we
can
not
and
must
not
turn
blind
eye
to
what
happened
in
damascus
out
of
the
ashes
of
world
war
we
built
an
international
order
and
enforced
the
rules
that
gave
it
meaning
and
we
did
so
because
we
believe
that
the
rights
of
individuals
to
live
in
peace
and
dignity
depends
on
the
responsibilities
of
nations
we
are
perfect
but
this
nation
more
than
any
other
has
been
willing
to
meet
those
responsibilities
so
to
all
members
of
congress
of
both
parties
ask
you
to
take
this
vote
for
our
national
security
am
looking
forward
to
the
debate
and
in
doing
so
ask
you
members
of
congress
to
consider
that
some
things
are
more
important
than
partisan
differences
or
the
politics
of
the
moment
ultimately
this
is
not
about
who
occupies
this
office
at
any
given
time
it
about
who
we
are
as
country
believe
that
the
people
representatives
must
be
invested
in
what
america
does
abroad
and
now
is
the
time
to
show
the
world
that
america
keeps
our
commitments
we
do
what
we
say
and
we
lead
with
the
belief
that
right
makes
might
not
the
other
way
around
we
all
know
there
are
no
easy
options
but
was
elected
to
avoid
hard
decisions
and
neither
were
the
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate
told
you
what
believe
that
our
security
and
our
values
demand
that
we
can
not
turn
away
from
the
massacre
of
countless
civilians
with
chemical
weapons
and
our
democracy
is
stronger
when
the
president
and
the
people
representatives
stand
together
ready
to
act
in
the
face
of
this
outrage
today
asking
congress
to
send
message
to
the
world
that
we
are
ready
to
move
forward
together
as
one
nation
thanks
very
much
to
the
king
family
who
have
sacrificed
and
inspired
so
much
to
president
president
carter
vice
president
and
fellow
americans
five
decades
ago
today
americans
came
to
this
place
to
lay
claim
to
promise
made
at
our
founding
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
in
almost
years
after
those
words
were
set
to
paper
full
century
after
great
war
was
fought
and
emancipation
proclaimed
that
promise
those
truths
remained
unmet
and
so
they
came
by
the
thousands
from
every
corner
of
our
country
men
and
women
young
and
old
blacks
who
longed
for
freedom
and
whites
who
could
no
longer
accept
freedom
for
themselves
while
witnessing
the
subjugation
of
others
across
the
land
congregations
sent
them
off
with
food
and
with
prayer
in
the
middle
of
the
night
entire
blocks
of
came
out
to
wish
them
well
with
the
few
dollars
they
scrimped
from
their
some
bought
tickets
and
boarded
buses
even
if
they
always
sit
where
they
wanted
to
sit
those
with
less
money
hitchhiked
or
walked
they
were
seamstresses
and
steelworkers
students
and
teachers
maids
and
porters
they
shared
simple
meals
and
bunked
together
on
floors
and
then
on
hot
summer
day
they
assembled
here
in
our
capital
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
emancipator
to
offer
testimony
of
injustice
to
petition
their
government
for
redress
and
to
awaken
conscience
we
rightly
and
best
remember
soaring
oratory
that
day
how
he
gave
mighty
voice
to
the
quiet
hopes
of
millions
how
he
offered
salvation
path
for
oppressed
and
oppressors
alike
his
words
belong
to
the
ages
possessing
power
and
prophecy
unmatched
in
our
time
but
we
would
do
well
to
recall
that
day
itself
also
belonged
to
those
ordinary
people
whose
names
never
appeared
in
the
history
books
never
got
on
many
had
gone
to
segregated
schools
and
sat
at
segregated
lunch
counters
they
lived
in
towns
where
they
vote
and
cities
where
their
votes
matter
they
were
couples
in
love
who
marry
soldiers
who
fought
for
freedom
abroad
that
they
found
denied
to
them
at
home
they
had
seen
loved
ones
beaten
and
children
and
they
had
every
reason
to
lash
out
in
anger
or
resign
themselves
to
bitter
fate
and
yet
they
chose
different
path
in
the
face
of
hatred
they
prayed
for
their
tormentors
in
the
face
of
violence
they
stood
up
and
sat
in
with
the
moral
force
of
nonviolence
willingly
they
went
to
jail
to
protest
unjust
laws
their
cells
swelling
with
the
sound
of
freedom
songs
lifetime
of
indignities
had
taught
them
that
no
man
can
take
away
the
dignity
and
grace
that
god
grants
us
they
had
learned
through
hard
experience
what
once
taught
that
freedom
is
not
given
it
must
be
won
through
struggle
and
discipline
persistence
and
faith
that
was
the
spirit
they
brought
here
that
day
that
was
the
spirit
young
people
like
john
brought
to
that
day
that
was
the
spirit
that
they
carried
with
them
like
torch
back
to
their
cities
and
their
that
steady
flame
of
conscience
and
courage
that
would
sustain
them
through
the
campaigns
to
come
through
boycotts
and
voter
registration
drives
and
smaller
marches
far
from
the
spotlight
through
the
loss
of
four
little
girls
in
and
the
carnage
of
the
bridge
and
the
agony
of
dallas
and
california
and
memphis
through
setbacks
and
heartbreaks
and
gnawing
doubt
that
flame
of
justice
flickered
it
never
died
and
because
they
kept
marching
america
changed
because
they
marched
civil
rights
law
was
passed
because
they
marched
voting
rights
law
was
signed
because
they
marched
doors
of
opportunity
and
education
swung
open
so
their
daughters
and
sons
could
finally
imagine
life
for
themselves
beyond
washing
somebody
laundry
or
shining
somebody
shoes
because
they
marched
city
councils
changed
and
state
legislatures
changed
and
congress
changed
and
yes
eventually
the
white
house
changed
because
they
marched
america
became
more
free
and
more
fair
not
just
for
african
americans
but
for
women
and
asians
and
native
americans
for
jews
and
muslims
for
gays
for
americans
with
disability
america
changed
for
you
and
for
me
and
the
entire
world
drew
strength
from
that
example
whether
the
young
people
who
watched
from
the
other
side
of
an
iron
curtain
and
would
eventually
tear
down
that
wall
or
the
young
people
inside
south
africa
who
would
eventually
end
the
scourge
of
those
are
the
victories
they
won
with
iron
wills
and
hope
in
their
hearts
that
is
the
transformation
that
they
wrought
with
each
step
of
their
shoes
the
debt
that
and
millions
of
americans
owe
those
maids
those
those
porters
those
secretaries
folks
who
could
have
run
company
maybe
if
they
had
ever
had
chance
those
white
students
who
put
themselves
in
way
even
though
they
did
have
those
americans
who
recalled
their
own
internment
those
jewish
americans
who
had
survived
the
holocaust
people
who
could
have
given
up
and
given
in
but
kept
on
keeping
on
knowing
that
may
endure
for
night
but
joy
in
the
on
the
battlefield
of
justice
men
and
women
without
rank
or
wealth
or
title
or
fame
would
liberate
us
all
in
ways
that
our
children
now
take
for
granted
as
people
of
all
and
creeds
live
together
and
learn
together
and
walk
together
and
fight
alongside
one
another
and
love
one
another
and
judge
one
another
by
the
content
of
our
character
in
this
greatest
nation
on
earth
to
dismiss
the
magnitude
of
this
progress
to
suggest
as
some
sometimes
do
that
little
has
changed
that
the
courage
and
the
sacrifice
of
those
who
paid
the
price
to
march
in
those
years
james
andrew
martin
luther
king
they
did
not
die
in
vain
their
victory
was
great
but
we
would
those
as
well
to
suggest
that
the
work
of
this
nation
is
somehow
complete
the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
may
bend
towards
justice
but
it
bend
on
its
own
to
secure
the
gains
this
country
has
made
requires
constant
vigilance
not
complacency
whether
by
challenging
those
who
erect
new
barriers
to
the
vote
or
ensuring
that
the
scales
of
justice
work
equally
for
all
and
the
criminal
justice
system
is
not
simply
pipeline
from
underfunded
schools
to
overcrowded
jails
it
requires
vigilance
and
we
suffer
the
occasional
setback
but
we
will
win
these
fights
this
country
has
changed
too
much
people
of
goodwill
regardless
of
party
are
too
plentiful
for
those
with
ill
will
to
change
currents
in
some
ways
though
the
securing
of
civil
rights
voting
rights
the
eradication
of
discrimination
the
very
significance
of
these
victories
may
have
obscured
second
goal
of
the
march
for
the
men
and
women
who
gathered
years
ago
were
not
there
in
search
of
some
abstract
ideal
they
were
there
seeking
jobs
as
well
as
justice
not
just
the
absence
of
oppression
but
the
presence
of
economic
opportunity
for
what
does
it
profit
man
king
would
ask
to
sit
at
an
integrated
lunch
counter
if
he
afford
the
meal
this
idea
that
liberty
is
linked
to
livelihood
that
the
pursuit
of
happiness
requires
the
dignity
of
work
the
skills
to
find
work
decent
pay
some
measure
of
material
security
this
idea
was
not
new
lincoln
himself
understood
the
declaration
of
independence
in
such
terms
as
promise
that
in
due
time
weights
should
be
lifted
from
the
shoulders
of
all
men
and
that
all
should
have
an
equal
and
king
explained
that
the
goals
of
african
americans
were
identical
to
working
people
of
all
races
wages
fair
working
conditions
livable
housing
security
health
and
welfare
measures
conditions
in
which
families
can
grow
have
education
for
their
children
and
respect
in
the
what
king
was
describing
has
been
the
dream
of
every
american
it
what
lured
for
centuries
new
arrivals
to
our
shores
and
along
this
second
dimension
of
economic
opportunity
the
chance
through
honest
toil
to
advance
station
in
life
where
the
goals
of
years
ago
have
fallen
most
short
yes
there
have
been
examples
of
success
within
black
america
that
would
have
been
unimaginable
half
century
ago
but
as
has
already
been
noted
black
unemployment
has
remained
almost
twice
as
high
as
white
unemployment
latino
unemployment
close
behind
the
gap
in
wealth
between
races
has
not
lessened
it
grown
and
as
president
indicated
the
position
of
all
working
americans
regardless
of
has
eroded
making
the
dream
king
described
even
more
elusive
for
over
decade
working
americans
of
all
races
have
seen
their
wages
and
incomes
stagnate
even
as
corporate
profits
soar
even
as
the
pay
of
fortunate
few
explodes
inequality
has
steadily
risen
over
the
decades
upward
mobility
has
become
harder
in
too
many
communities
across
this
country
in
cities
and
suburbs
and
rural
hamlets
the
shadow
of
poverty
casts
pall
over
our
youth
their
lives
fortress
of
substandard
schools
and
diminished
prospects
inadequate
health
care
and
perennial
violence
and
so
as
we
mark
this
anniversary
we
must
remind
ourselves
that
the
measure
of
progress
for
those
who
marched
years
ago
was
not
merely
how
many
blacks
could
join
the
ranks
of
millionaires
it
was
whether
this
country
would
admit
all
people
who
are
willing
to
work
hard
regardless
of
race
into
the
ranks
of
life
the
test
was
not
and
never
has
been
whether
the
doors
of
opportunity
are
cracked
bit
wider
for
few
it
was
whether
our
economic
system
provides
fair
shot
for
the
many
for
the
black
custodian
and
the
white
steelworker
the
immigrant
dishwasher
and
the
native
american
veteran
to
win
that
battle
to
answer
that
call
this
remains
our
great
unfinished
business
we
fool
ourselves
the
task
will
not
be
easy
since
the
economy
has
changed
the
twin
forces
of
technology
and
global
competition
have
subtracted
those
jobs
that
once
provided
foothold
into
the
middle
class
reduced
the
bargaining
power
of
american
workers
and
our
politics
has
suffered
entrenched
interests
those
who
benefit
from
an
unjust
status
resisted
any
government
efforts
to
give
working
families
fair
deal
an
army
of
lobbyists
and
opinion
makers
to
argue
that
minimum
wage
increases
or
stronger
laws
or
taxes
on
the
wealthy
who
could
afford
it
just
to
fund
crumbling
schools
that
all
these
things
violated
sound
economic
principles
we
be
told
that
growing
inequality
was
price
for
growing
economy
measure
of
this
free
market
that
greed
was
good
and
compassion
ineffective
and
those
without
jobs
or
health
care
had
only
themselves
to
blame
and
then
there
were
those
elected
officials
who
found
it
useful
to
practice
the
old
politics
of
division
doing
their
best
to
convince
americans
of
great
untruth
that
government
was
somehow
itself
to
blame
for
their
growing
economic
insecurity
that
distant
bureaucrats
were
taking
their
dollars
to
benefit
the
welfare
cheat
or
the
illegal
immigrant
and
then
if
we
honest
with
ourselves
we
admit
that
during
the
course
of
years
there
were
times
when
some
of
us
claiming
to
push
for
change
lost
our
way
the
anguish
of
assassinations
set
off
riots
legitimate
grievances
against
police
brutality
tipped
into
for
criminal
racial
politics
could
cut
both
ways
as
the
transformative
message
of
unity
and
brotherhood
was
drowned
out
by
the
language
of
recrimination
and
what
had
once
been
call
for
equality
of
opportunity
the
chance
for
all
americans
to
work
hard
and
get
ahead
was
too
often
framed
as
mere
desire
for
government
support
as
if
we
had
no
agency
in
our
own
liberation
as
if
poverty
was
an
excuse
for
not
raising
your
child
and
the
bigotry
of
others
was
reason
to
give
up
on
yourself
all
of
that
history
is
how
progress
stalled
that
how
hope
was
diverted
it
how
our
country
remained
divided
but
the
good
news
is
just
as
was
true
in
we
now
have
choice
we
can
continue
down
our
current
path
in
which
the
gears
of
this
great
democracy
grind
to
halt
and
our
children
accept
life
of
lower
expectations
where
politics
is
game
where
few
do
very
well
while
struggling
families
of
every
race
fight
over
shrinking
economic
pie
one
path
or
we
can
have
the
courage
to
change
the
march
on
washington
teaches
us
that
we
are
not
trapped
by
the
mistakes
of
history
that
we
are
masters
of
our
fate
but
it
also
teaches
us
that
the
promise
of
this
nation
will
only
be
kept
when
we
work
together
have
to
the
embers
of
empathy
and
fellow
feeling
the
coalition
of
conscience
that
found
expression
in
this
place
years
ago
and
believe
that
spirit
is
there
that
truth
force
inside
each
of
us
see
it
when
white
mother
her
own
daughter
in
the
face
of
poor
black
child
see
it
when
the
black
youth
thinks
of
his
own
grandfather
in
the
dignified
steps
of
an
elderly
white
man
there
when
the
that
striving
spirit
of
the
new
immigrant
when
the
interracial
couple
connects
the
pain
of
gay
couple
who
are
discriminated
against
and
understands
it
as
their
own
where
courage
comes
from
when
we
turn
not
from
each
other
or
on
each
other
but
towards
one
another
and
we
find
that
we
do
not
walk
alone
where
courage
comes
from
and
with
that
courage
we
can
stand
together
for
good
jobs
and
just
wages
with
that
courage
we
can
stand
together
for
the
right
to
health
care
in
the
richest
nation
on
earth
for
every
person
with
that
courage
we
can
stand
together
for
the
right
of
every
child
from
the
corners
of
to
the
hills
of
to
get
an
education
that
stirs
the
mind
and
captures
the
spirit
and
prepares
them
for
the
world
that
awaits
them
with
that
courage
we
can
feed
the
hungry
and
house
the
homeless
and
transform
bleak
wastelands
of
poverty
into
fields
of
commerce
and
promise
america
know
the
road
will
be
long
but
know
we
can
get
there
yes
we
will
stumble
but
know
get
back
up
how
movement
happens
how
history
bends
that
how
when
somebody
is
faint
of
heart
somebody
else
brings
them
along
and
says
come
on
marching
reason
why
so
many
who
marched
that
day
and
in
the
days
to
come
were
young
for
the
young
are
unconstrained
by
habits
of
fear
unconstrained
by
the
conventions
of
what
is
they
dared
to
dream
differently
to
imagine
something
better
and
am
convinced
that
same
imagination
the
same
hunger
of
purpose
stirs
in
this
generation
we
might
not
face
the
same
dangers
of
but
the
fierce
urgency
of
now
remains
we
may
never
duplicate
the
swelling
crowds
and
dazzling
procession
of
that
day
so
long
ago
no
one
can
match
brilliance
but
the
same
flame
that
lit
the
heart
of
all
who
are
willing
to
take
first
step
for
justice
know
that
flame
remains
that
tireless
teacher
who
gets
to
class
early
and
stays
late
and
dips
into
her
own
pocket
to
buy
supplies
because
she
believes
that
every
child
is
her
charge
marching
that
successful
businessman
who
does
have
to
but
pays
his
workers
fair
wage
and
then
offers
shot
to
man
maybe
an
who
is
down
on
his
luck
marching
the
mother
who
pours
her
love
into
her
daughter
so
that
she
grows
up
with
the
confidence
to
walk
through
the
same
door
as
son
marching
the
father
who
the
most
important
job
ever
have
is
raising
his
boy
right
even
if
he
did
have
father
especially
if
he
did
have
father
at
home
marching
the
veterans
who
devote
themselves
not
only
to
helping
their
fellow
warriors
stand
again
and
walk
again
and
run
again
but
to
keep
serving
their
country
when
they
come
home
they
are
marching
everyone
who
what
those
glorious
patriots
knew
on
that
day
that
change
does
not
come
from
washington
but
to
washington
that
change
has
always
been
built
on
our
willingness
we
the
people
to
take
on
the
mantle
of
citizenship
you
are
marching
and
the
lesson
of
our
past
that
the
promise
of
tomorrow
that
in
the
face
of
impossible
odds
people
who
love
their
country
can
change
it
that
when
millions
of
americans
of
every
race
and
every
region
every
faith
and
every
station
can
join
together
in
spirit
of
brotherhood
then
those
mountains
will
be
made
low
and
those
rough
places
will
be
made
plain
and
those
crooked
places
they
straighten
out
towards
grace
and
we
will
vindicate
the
faith
of
those
who
sacrificed
so
much
and
live
up
to
the
true
meaning
of
our
creed
as
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice

is
here
there
she
is
attorney
general
is
here

bunch
of
my
former
colleagues
some
folks
who
have
seen
in
years
and
looking
forward
to
saying
hi
to
one
in
particular
got
to
mention
one
of
my
from
the
illinois
senate
john
is
in
the
house
john
was
one
of
my
earliest
supporters
when
was
running
for
the
senate
and
it
came
in
really
handy
because
got
like
brothers
and
sisters
and
his
wife
has
got
brothers
and
sisters
so
got
this
entire
precinct
just
in
their
family
and
they
all
look
like
john
the
brothers
do
so
he
have
to
go
to
every
event
he
can
just
send
one
of
his
brothers
out
it
is
good
to
see
him
make
it
today
but
he
sends
his
best
and
we
love
doing
great
job
and
got
one
of
my
the
senator
from
missouri
in
the
house
because
going
to
missouri
later
this
afternoon
and
all
of
you
are
here
and
great
to
see
you
and
hope
everybody
is
having
wonderful
summer
the
weather
is
perfect
whoever
was
in
charge
of
that
good
job
so
eight
years
ago
came
here
to
deliver
the
commencement
address
for
the
class
of
things
were
little
different
back
then
for
example
had
no
hair
or
motorcade
even
have
prompter
in
fact
there
was
problem
in
terms
of
printing
out
the
because
the
printer
work
here
and
we
had
to
drive
it
in
from
somewhere
but
it
was
my
first
big
as
your
newest
senator
and
on
the
way
here
was
telling
and
about
how
important
this
area
was
one
of
the
areas
that
spent
the
most
time
in
outside
of
chicago
and
how
much
it
represented
best
in
america
and
folks
who
were
willing
to
work
hard
and
do
right
by
their
families
and
came
here
to
talk
about
what
changing
economy
was
doing
to
the
middle
class
and
what
we
as
country
needed
to
do
to
give
every
american
chance
to
get
ahead
in
the
century
see
had
just
spent
year
the
state
and
listening
to
your
stories
of
proud
workers
losing
their
jobs
when
the
plant
moved
down
to
mexico
lot
of
folks
here
remember
that
of
teachers
whose
salaries
keeping
up
with
the
rising
cost
of
groceries
of
young
people
who
had
the
drive
and
the
energy
but
not
the
money
to
afford
college
education
so
these
were
stories
of
families
who
had
worked
hard
believed
in
the
american
dream
but
they
felt
like
the
odds
were
increasingly
stacked
against
them
and
they
were
right
things
had
changed
in
the
period
after
world
war
growing
middle
class
was
the
engine
of
our
prosperity
whether
you
owned
company
or
swept
its
floors
or
worked
anywhere
in
between
this
country
offered
you
basic
bargain
sense
that
your
hard
work
would
be
rewarded
with
fair
wages
and
decent
benefits
the
chance
to
buy
home
to
save
for
retirement
and
most
of
all
chance
to
hand
down
better
life
for
your
kids
but
over
time
that
engine
began
to
stall
and
lot
of
folks
here
saw
it
that
bargain
began
to
fray
technology
made
some
jobs
obsolete
global
competition
sent
lot
of
jobs
overseas
it
became
harder
for
unions
to
fight
for
the
middle
class
washington
doled
out
bigger
tax
cuts
to
the
very
wealthy
and
smaller
minimum
wage
increases
for
the
working
poor
and
so
what
happened
was
that
the
link
between
higher
productivity
and
wages
and
salaries
was
broken
it
used
to
be
that
as
companies
did
better
as
profits
went
higher
workers
also
got
better
deal
and
that
started
changing
so
the
income
of
the
top
percent
nearly
quadrupled
from
to
but
the
typical
incomes
barely
budged
and
towards
the
end
of
those
three
decades
housing
bubble
credit
cards
churning
financial
sector
was
keeping
the
economy
artificially
up
so
sometimes
it
papered
over
some
of
these
trends
but
by
the
time
took
office
in
as
your
president
we
all
know
the
bubble
had
burst
and
it
cost
millions
of
americans
their
jobs
and
their
homes
and
their
savings
and
know
lot
of
folks
in
this
area
were
hurt
pretty
bad
and
the
erosion
that
had
been
taking
place
the
erosion
of
security
was
suddenly
laid
bare
for
everybody
to
see
now
today
five
years
after
the
start
of
that
great
recession
america
has
fought
its
way
back
we
fought
our
way
back
together
we
saved
the
auto
industry
took
on
broken
health
care
system
we
invested
in
new
american
technologies
to
reverse
our
addiction
to
foreign
oil
we
doubled
wind
and
solar
power
together
we
put
in
place
tough
new
rules
on
the
big
banks
and
protections
to
crack
down
on
the
worst
practices
of
mortgage
lenders
and
credit
card
companies
we
changed
tax
code
too
skewed
in
of
the
wealthiest
at
the
expense
of
working
families
so
we
changed
that
and
we
locked
in
tax
cuts
for
percent
of
americans
and
we
asked
those
at
the
top
to
pay
little
bit
more
so
you
add
it
all
up
and
over
the
past
months
our
businesses
have
created
million
new
jobs
this
year
off
to
our
strongest
private
sector
job
growth
since
and
because
we
bet
on
this
country
suddenly
foreign
companies
are
too
right
now
more
of
cars
are
made
in
america
than
anyplace
else
on
earth
airbus
the
european
aircraft
company
building
new
planes
in
alabama
and
american
companies
like
ford
are
replacing
outsourcing
with
bringing
jobs
back
home
we
sell
more
products
made
in
america
to
the
rest
of
the
world
than
ever
before
we
produce
more
natural
gas
than
any
country
on
earth
about
to
produce
more
of
our
own
oil
than
we
buy
from
abroad
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
years
the
cost
of
health
care
is
growing
at
its
slowest
rate
in
years
and
our
deficits
are
falling
at
the
fastest
rate
in
years
so
thanks
to
the
grit
and
resilience
and
determination
of
the
american
people
of
folks
like
you
been
able
to
clear
away
the
rubble
from
the
financial
crisis
we
started
to
lay
new
foundation
for
stronger
more
durable
economic
growth
and
it
happening
in
our
own
personal
lives
as
well
right
lot
of
us
tightened
our
belts
shed
debt
maybe
cut
up
couple
of
credit
cards
refocused
on
those
things
that
really
matter
as
country
recovered
faster
and
gone
further
than
most
other
advanced
nations
in
the
world
with
new
american
revolutions
in
energy
and
technology
and
manufacturing
and
health
care
we
actually
poised
to
reverse
the
forces
that
battered
the
middle
class
for
so
long
and
start
building
an
economy
where
everyone
who
works
hard
can
get
ahead
but
and
here
the
big
here
to
tell
you
today
that
we
not
there
yet
we
all
know
that
we
not
there
yet
we
got
more
work
to
do
even
though
our
businesses
are
creating
new
jobs
and
have
broken
record
profits
nearly
all
the
income
gains
of
the
past
years
have
continued
to
flow
to
the
top
percent
the
average
has
gotten
raise
of
nearly
percent
since
the
average
american
earns
less
than
he
or
she
did
in
and
companies
continue
to
hold
back
on
hiring
those
been
out
of
work
for
some
time
today
more
students
are
earning
their
degree
but
soaring
costs
saddle
them
with
unsustainable
debt
health
care
costs
are
slowing
down
but
lot
of
working
families
seen
any
of
those
savings
yet
the
stock
market
rebound
helped
lot
of
families
get
back
much
of
what
they
had
lost
in
their
but
millions
of
americans
still
have
no
idea
how
going
to
be
able
to
retire
so
in
many
ways
the
trends
that
spoke
about
here
in
eight
years
ago
the
trend
of
economy
where
few
are
doing
better
and
better
and
better
while
everybody
else
just
treads
water
those
trends
have
been
made
worse
by
the
recession
and
that
problem
this
growing
inequality
not
just
of
result
inequality
of
opportunity
this
growing
inequality
is
not
just
morally
wrong
bad
economics
because
when
families
have
less
to
spend
guess
what
businesses
have
fewer
consumers
when
wealth
concentrates
at
the
very
top
it
can
inflate
unstable
bubbles
that
threaten
the
economy
when
the
rungs
on
the
ladder
of
opportunity
grow
farther
and
farther
apart
it
undermines
the
very
essence
of
america
that
idea
that
if
you
work
hard
you
can
make
it
here
and
why
reversing
these
trends
has
to
be
highest
priority
it
has
to
be
washington
highest
priority
certainly
my
highest
priority
unfortunately
over
the
past
couple
of
years
in
particular
washington
just
ignored
this
problem
too
often
washington
has
made
things
worse
and
have
to
say
that
because
looking
around
the
room
got
some
friends
here
not
just
who
are
democrats
got
some
friends
here
who
are
republicans
and
worked
with
in
the
state
legislature
and
they
did
great
work
but
right
now
what
got
in
washington
we
seen
group
of
republican
lawmakers
suggest
that
they
vote
to
pay
the
very
bills
that
congress
rang
up
and
that
fiasco
harmed
fragile
recovery
in
and
we
afford
to
repeat
that
then
rather
than
reduce
our
deficits
with
scalpel
by
cutting
out
programs
we
need
fixing
ones
that
we
do
need
that
maybe
are
in
need
of
reform
making
government
more
efficient
instead
of
doing
that
we
got
folks
insisted
on
leaving
in
place
meat
cleaver
called
the
that
cost
jobs
it
harmed
growth
it
hurt
our
military
it
gutted
investments
in
education
and
science
and
medical
research
almost
every
credible
economist
will
tell
you
it
been
huge
drag
on
this
recovery
and
it
means
that
we
in
the
things
that
this
country
needs
to
make
it
magnet
for
good
jobs
then
over
the
last
six
months
this
gridlock
has
gotten
worse
did
think
that
was
possible
the
good
news
is
growing
number
of
republican
senators
are
looking
to
join
their
democratic
counterparts
and
try
to
get
things
done
in
the
senate
so
that
good
news
for
example
they
worked
together
on
an
immigration
bill
that
economists
say
will
boost
our
economy
by
more
than
trillion
dollars
strengthen
border
security
make
the
system
work
but
you
got
faction
of
republicans
in
the
house
who
even
give
that
bill
vote
and
that
same
group
gutted
farm
bill
that
farmers
depend
on
but
also
america
most
vulnerable
children
depend
on
and
if
you
ask
some
of
these
folks
some
of
these
folks
mostly
in
the
house
about
their
economic
agenda
how
it
is
that
they
strengthen
the
middle
class
shift
the
topic
to
government
despite
the
fact
that
we
cut
the
deficit
by
nearly
half
as
share
of
the
economy
since
took
office
or
talk
about
government
assistance
for
the
poor
despite
the
fact
that
already
cut
early
education
for
vulnerable
kids
they
already
cut
insurance
for
people
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own
or
bring
up
this
is
tried
and
true
despite
the
fact
that
our
businesses
have
created
nearly
twice
as
many
jobs
in
this
recovery
as
businesses
had
at
the
same
point
in
the
last
recovery
when
there
was
no
audience
member
my
daughter
has
insurance
now
president
appreciate
that
what
this
is
about
what
this
is
about
what
we
been
fighting
for
but
with
this
endless
parade
of
distractions
and
political
posturing
and
phony
scandals
washington
has
taken
its
eye
off
the
ball
and
am
here
to
say
this
needs
to
stop
this
needs
to
stop
this
moment
does
not
require
thinking
it
does
not
require
having
the
same
old
stale
debates
our
focus
has
to
be
on
the
basic
economic
issues
that
matter
most
to
you
the
people
we
represent
what
we
have
to
spend
our
time
on
and
our
energy
on
and
our
focus
on
and
as
washington
prepares
to
enter
another
budget
debate
the
stakes
for
our
middle
class
and
everybody
who
is
fighting
to
get
into
the
middle
class
could
not
be
higher
the
countries
that
are
passive
in
the
face
of
global
economy
those
countries
will
lose
the
competition
for
good
jobs
they
will
lose
the
competition
for
high
living
standards
why
america
has
to
make
the
investments
necessary
to
promote
growth
and
shared
prosperity
rebuilding
our
manufacturing
base
educating
our
workforce
upgrading
our
transportation
systems
upgrading
our
information
networks
what
we
need
to
be
talking
about
what
washington
needs
to
be
focused
on
and
why
over
the
next
several
weeks
in
towns
across
this
country
will
be
engaging
the
american
people
in
this
debate
lay
out
my
ideas
for
how
we
build
on
the
cornerstones
of
what
it
means
to
be
middle
class
in
america
and
what
it
takes
to
work
your
way
into
the
middle
class
in
america
job
security
with
good
wages
and
durable
industries
good
education
home
to
call
your
own
affordable
health
care
when
you
get
sick
secure
retirement
even
if
not
rich
reducing
poverty
reducing
inequality
growing
opportunity
what
we
need
what
we
need
what
we
need
right
now
what
we
need
to
be
focused
on
now
some
of
these
ideas
talked
about
before
some
of
the
ideas
offer
will
be
new
some
will
require
congress
some
will
pursue
on
my
own
some
ideas
will
benefit
folks
right
away
some
will
take
years
to
fully
implement
but
the
key
is
to
break
through
the
tendency
in
washington
to
just
bounce
from
crisis
to
crisis
what
we
need
is
not
plan
or
even
plan
we
need
american
strategy
based
on
steady
persistent
effort
to
reverse
the
forces
that
have
conspired
against
the
middle
class
for
decades
that
has
to
be
our
project
now
of
course
keep
pressing
on
other
key
priorities
want
to
get
this
immigration
bill
done
we
still
need
to
work
on
reducing
gun
violence
got
to
continue
to
end
the
war
in
our
fight
against
we
need
to
combat
climate
change
got
to
standing
up
for
civil
rights
got
to
stand
up
for
rights
so
all
those
issues
are
important
and
be
fighting
on
every
one
of
those
issues
but
if
we
have
growing
thriving
middle
class
then
we
have
the
resources
to
solve
lot
of
these
problems
we
have
the
resolve
the
optimism
the
sense
of
unity
that
we
need
to
solve
many
of
these
other
issues
now
in
this
effort
will
look
to
work
with
republicans
as
well
as
democrats
wherever
can
and
sincerely
believe
that
there
are
members
of
both
parties
who
understand
this
moment
understand
at
stake
and
will
welcome
ideas
from
anybody
across
the
political
spectrum
but
will
not
allow
gridlock
or
inaction
or
indifference
to
get
in
our
way
that
means
whatever
executive
authority
have
to
help
the
middle
class
use
it
where
act
on
my
own
and
congress
cooperating
pick
up
the
phone
call
call
philanthropists
call
college
presidents
call
leaders
call
anybody
who
can
help
and
enlist
them
in
our
efforts
because
the
choices
that
we
the
people
make
right
now
will
determine
whether
or
not
every
american
has
fighting
chance
in
the
century
and
it
will
lay
the
foundation
for
our
future
our
future
for
all
americans
so
let
me
give
you
quick
preview
of
what
be
fighting
for
and
why
the
first
cornerstone
of
strong
growing
middle
class
has
to
be
as
said
before
an
economy
that
generates
more
good
jobs
in
durable
growing
industries
that
how
this
area
was
built
that
how
america
prospered
because
anybody
who
was
willing
to
work
they
could
go
out
there
and
they
could
find
themselves
job
and
they
could
build
life
for
themselves
and
their
family
now
over
the
past
four
years
for
the
first
time
since
the
the
number
of
american
manufacturing
jobs
has
actually
gone
up
instead
of
down
that
the
good
news
but
we
can
do
more
so
going
to
push
new
initiatives
to
help
more
manufacturers
bring
more
jobs
back
to
the
united
states
going
to
continue
to
focus
on
strategies
to
make
sure
our
tax
code
rewards
companies
that
are
not
shipping
jobs
overseas
but
creating
jobs
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
want
to
make
sure
that
going
to
create
strategies
to
make
sure
that
good
jobs
in
wind
and
solar
and
natural
gas
that
are
lowering
costs
and
at
the
same
time
reducing
dangerous
carbon
pollution
happen
right
here
in
the
united
states
and
something
that
and
were
talking
about
on
the
way
over
here
going
to
be
pushing
to
open
more
manufacturing
innovation
institutes
that
turn
regions
left
behind
by
global
competition
into
global
of
jobs
so
tell
the
world
that
america
is
open
for
business
know
an
old
site
right
here
in
over
on
boulevard
put
some
folks
to
work
tomorrow
also
visit
the
port
of
florida
to
offer
new
ideas
for
doing
what
america
has
always
done
best
which
is
building
things
pat
and
were
talking
before
came
backstage
pat
he
was
talking
about
how
came
over
the
don
bridge
but
got
work
to
do
all
across
the
country
got
ports
that
ready
for
the
new
supertankers
that
are
going
to
begin
passing
through
the
new
panama
canal
in
two
time
if
we
get
that
done
those
tankers
are
going
to
go
else
got
more
than
bridges
that
are
old
enough
to
qualify
for
businesses
depend
on
our
transportation
systems
on
our
power
grids
on
our
communications
networks
and
rebuilding
them
creates
jobs
right
now
that
be
and
by
the
way
this
democratic
idea
republicans
built
lot
of
stuff
this
is
the
land
of
lincoln
lincoln
was
all
about
building
stuff
first
republican
president
and
yet
as
share
of
our
economy
we
invest
less
in
our
infrastructure
than
we
did
two
decades
ago
and
inefficient
at
time
when
as
cheap
as
been
since
the
to
build
things
inexcusable
at
time
when
so
many
of
the
workers
who
build
stuff
for
living
are
sitting
at
home
waiting
for
call
the
longer
we
put
this
off
the
more
expensive
it
will
be
and
the
less
competitive
we
will
be
businesses
of
tomorrow
will
not
locate
near
old
roads
and
outdated
ports
relocate
to
places
with
internet
and
schools
and
systems
that
move
air
and
auto
traffic
faster
and
not
to
mention
will
get
parents
home
quicker
from
work
because
be
eliminating
some
of
these
traffic
jams
and
we
can
watch
all
of
that
happen
in
other
countries
and
start
falling
behind
or
we
can
choose
to
make
it
happen
right
here
in
the
united
states
in
an
age
when
jobs
know
no
borders
companies
are
also
going
to
seek
out
the
countries
that
boast
the
most
talented
citizens
and
reward
folks
who
have
the
skills
and
the
talents
they
need
reward
those
folks
with
good
pay
the
days
when
the
wages
for
worker
with
high
school
degree
could
keep
pace
with
the
earnings
of
somebody
who
got
some
sort
of
higher
education
those
days
are
over
everybody
here
knows
that
there
are
whole
bunch
of
folks
here
whose
dads
or
grandpas
worked
at
plant
need
high
school
education
you
could
just
go
there
if
you
were
willing
to
work
hard
you
might
be
able
to
get
two
jobs
and
you
could
support
your
family
have
vacation
own
your
home
but
technology
and
global
competition
not
going
away
those
old
days
coming
back
so
we
can
either
throw
up
our
hands
and
resign
ourselves
to
diminishing
living
standards
or
we
can
do
what
america
has
always
done
which
is
adapt
and
pull
together
and
fight
back
and
win
what
we
have
to
do
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
cornerstone
of
strong
middle
class
and
everybody
here
knows
it
an
education
that
prepares
our
children
and
our
workers
for
the
global
competition
that
going
to
face
and
if
you
think
education
is
expensive
wait
until
you
see
how
much
ignorance
costs
in
the
century
if
we
make
this
investment
going
to
put
our
kids
our
workers
and
our
country
at
competitive
disadvantage
for
decades
so
we
have
to
begin
in
the
earliest
years
and
why
going
to
keep
pushing
to
make
preschool
available
for
every
in
america
not
just
because
we
know
it
works
for
our
kids
but
because
it
provides
vital
support
system
for
working
parents
and
going
to
take
action
in
the
education
area
to
spur
innovation
that
require
congress
so
today
for
example
as
we
speak
federal
agencies
are
moving
on
my
plan
to
connect
percent
of
students
to
internet
over
the
next
five
years
making
that
happen
right
now
already
begun
meeting
with
business
leaders
and
tech
entrepreneurs
and
innovative
educators
to
identify
the
best
ideas
for
redesigning
our
high
schools
so
that
they
teach
the
skills
required
for
economy
and
also
going
to
keep
pushing
new
efforts
to
train
workers
for
changing
jobs
so
here
in
for
example
lot
of
the
workers
that
were
laid
off
at
chose
to
enroll
in
retraining
programs
like
the
one
at
college
and
while
it
pay
off
for
everyone
lot
of
the
folks
who
were
retrained
found
jobs
that
suited
them
even
better
and
paid
even
more
than
the
ones
they
had
lost
and
why
asked
congress
to
start
community
college
to
career
initiative
so
that
workers
can
earn
the
skills
that
jobs
demand
without
leaving
their
and
going
to
challenge
from
some
of
best
companies
to
hire
more
americans
got
what
it
takes
to
fill
that
job
opening
but
have
been
laid
off
for
so
long
that
nobody
is
giving
their
an
honest
look
audience
member
more
talent
president
that
too
also
going
to
use
the
power
of
my
office
over
the
next
few
months
to
highlight
topic
straining
the
budgets
of
just
about
every
american
family
and
the
soaring
cost
of
higher
education
everybody
is
touched
by
this
including
your
president
who
had
whole
bunch
of
loans
he
had
to
pay
off
three
years
ago
worked
with
democrats
to
reform
the
student
loan
system
so
that
taxpayer
dollars
stopped
padding
the
pockets
of
big
banks
and
instead
helped
more
kids
afford
college
then
capped
loan
repayments
at
percent
of
monthly
incomes
for
responsible
borrowers
so
that
if
somebody
graduated
and
they
decided
to
take
teaching
job
for
example
that
pay
lot
of
money
they
knew
that
they
were
never
going
to
have
to
pay
more
than
percent
of
their
income
and
they
could
afford
to
go
into
profession
that
they
loved
in
place
right
now
and
this
week
working
with
both
parties
to
reverse
the
doubling
of
student
loan
rates
that
happened
few
weeks
ago
because
of
congressional
inaction
so
this
is
all
good
start
but
it
enough
families
and
taxpayers
just
keep
paying
more
and
more
and
more
into
an
undisciplined
system
where
costs
just
keep
on
going
up
and
up
and
up
never
have
enough
loan
money
never
have
enough
grant
money
to
keep
up
with
costs
that
are
going
up
percent
year
got
to
get
more
out
of
what
we
pay
for
now
some
colleges
are
testing
new
approaches
to
shorten
the
path
to
degree
or
blending
teaching
with
learning
to
help
students
master
material
and
earn
credits
in
less
time
in
some
states
testing
new
ways
to
fund
college
based
not
just
on
how
many
students
enroll
but
how
many
of
them
graduate
how
well
did
they
do
so
this
afternoon
visit
the
university
of
central
missouri
to
highlight
their
efforts
to
deliver
more
bang
for
the
buck
to
their
students
and
in
the
coming
months
will
lay
out
an
aggressive
strategy
to
shake
up
the
system
tackle
rising
costs
and
improve
value
for
students
and
their
families
it
is
critical
that
we
make
sure
that
college
is
affordable
for
every
single
american
willing
to
work
for
it
now
so
got
good
job
you
get
good
education
those
have
always
been
the
key
stepping
stones
into
the
middle
class
but
home
of
your
own
has
always
been
the
clearest
expression
of
security
for
most
families
your
biggest
asset
for
most
families
where
your
work
has
been
invested
and
that
changed
during
the
crisis
when
we
saw
millions
of
families
experience
their
home
values
plummeting
the
good
news
is
over
the
past
four
years
helped
more
responsible
homeowners
stay
in
their
homes
and
today
sales
are
up
and
prices
are
up
and
fewer
americans
see
their
homes
underwater
but
not
done
yet
the
key
now
is
to
encourage
that
based
on
unrealistic
bubbles
but
instead
is
based
on
solid
foundation
where
buyers
and
lenders
play
by
the
same
set
of
rules
rules
that
are
clear
and
transparent
and
fair
so
already
asked
congress
to
pass
really
good
bipartisan
idea
one
that
was
championed
by
the
way
by
mitt
economic
and
this
is
the
idea
to
give
every
homeowner
the
chance
to
refinance
their
mortgage
while
rates
are
still
low
so
they
can
save
thousands
of
dollars
year
it
will
be
like
tax
cut
for
families
who
can
refinance
also
acting
on
my
own
to
cut
red
tape
for
responsible
families
who
want
to
get
mortgage
but
the
bank
is
saying
no
work
with
both
parties
to
turn
the
page
on
and
mac
and
build
housing
finance
system
for
future
generations
so
got
more
work
to
do
to
strengthen
in
this
country
but
along
with
the
fourth
cornerstone
of
what
it
means
to
be
middle
class
in
this
country
is
secure
retirement
hear
from
too
many
people
across
the
country
face
to
face
or
in
letters
that
they
send
me
that
they
feel
as
if
retirement
is
just
receding
from
their
grasp
getting
farther
and
farther
away
they
see
it
now
today
rising
stock
market
has
millions
of
retirement
balances
going
up
and
some
of
the
losses
that
had
taken
place
during
the
financial
crisis
have
been
recovered
but
we
still
live
with
an
system
where
those
at
the
top
folks
like
me
get
generous
tax
incentives
to
save
while
tens
of
millions
of
hardworking
americans
who
are
struggling
they
get
none
of
those
breaks
at
all
so
as
we
work
to
reform
our
tax
code
we
should
find
new
ways
to
make
it
easier
for
workers
to
put
away
money
and
free
families
from
the
fear
that
they
be
able
to
retire
and
if
congress
is
looking
for
bipartisan
place
to
get
started
should
just
say
they
have
to
look
far
we
mentioned
immigration
reform
before
economists
show
that
immigration
reform
makes
undocumented
workers
pay
their
full
share
of
taxes
and
that
actually
shores
up
the
social
security
system
for
years
so
we
should
get
that
done
good
job
good
education
for
your
kids
home
of
your
own
secure
retirement
fifth
going
to
keep
focusing
on
health
care
because
families
and
small
business
owners
deserve
the
security
of
knowing
that
neither
an
accident
or
an
illness
is
going
to
threaten
the
dreams
that
worked
lifetime
to
build
as
we
speak
we
well
on
our
way
to
fully
implementing
the
affordable
care
act
we
going
to
implement
it
now
if
one
of
the
percent
of
americans
who
already
have
health
insurance
either
through
the
job
or
or
you
have
to
do
anything
but
you
do
have
new
benefits
and
better
protections
than
you
did
before
you
may
not
know
it
but
you
do
free
checkups
discounted
medicines
if
you
on
what
the
affordable
care
act
means
you
already
getting
better
deal
no
lifetime
limits
if
you
have
health
insurance
then
starting
on
october
private
plans
will
actually
compete
for
your
business
and
you
be
able
to
there
will
be
marketplace
just
like
buy
or
plane
tickets
or
anything
else
you
doing
and
you
be
able
to
buy
an
insurance
package
that
fits
your
budget
and
is
right
for
you
and
if
you
one
of
the
up
to
half
of
all
americans
been
sick
or
have
condition
if
you
look
at
this
auditorium
about
half
of
you
probably
have
condition
that
insurance
companies
could
use
to
not
give
you
insurance
if
you
lost
your
job
or
lost
your
insurance
well
this
law
means
that
beginning
january
insurance
companies
will
finally
have
to
cover
you
and
charge
you
the
same
rates
as
everybody
else
even
if
you
have
condition
what
the
affordable
care
act
does
what
it
does
now
look
know
because
been
living
it
that
there
are
folks
out
there
who
are
actively
working
to
make
this
law
fail
and
always
understand
exactly
what
their
logic
is
here
why
they
think
giving
insurance
to
folks
who
have
it
and
making
folks
with
insurance
little
more
secure
why
they
think
bad
thing
but
despite
the
politically
motivated
misinformation
campaign
the
states
that
have
committed
themselves
to
making
this
law
work
are
finding
that
competition
and
choice
are
actually
pushing
costs
down
so
just
last
week
new
york
announced
that
premiums
for
consumers
who
buy
their
insurance
in
these
will
be
at
least
percent
lower
than
what
they
paying
today
percent
lower
so
folks
premiums
in
the
individual
market
will
drop
by
percent
and
for
them
and
for
the
millions
of
americans
been
able
to
cover
their
sick
kids
for
the
first
time
like
this
gentlemen
who
just
said
his
daughter
has
got
health
insurance
or
have
been
able
to
cover
their
employees
more
cheaply
or
are
able
to
have
their
kids
who
are
younger
than
who
are
or
stay
on
their
parents
plan
for
all
those
folks
you
have
the
security
of
knowing
that
everything
worked
hard
for
is
no
longer
one
illness
away
from
being
wiped
out
finally
as
we
work
to
strengthen
these
cornerstones
of
security
good
job
with
decent
wages
and
benefits
good
education
home
of
your
own
retirement
security
health
care
security
going
to
make
the
case
for
why
we
got
to
rebuild
ladders
of
opportunity
for
all
those
americans
who
have
quite
made
it
yet
who
are
working
hard
but
are
still
suffering
poverty
wages
who
are
struggling
to
get
work
there
are
lot
of
folks
who
are
still
struggling
out
here
too
many
people
in
poverty
here
in
america
never
guaranteed
success
that
not
what
we
do
more
than
some
other
countries
we
expect
people
to
be
nobody
is
going
to
do
something
for
you
we
tolerated
little
more
inequality
for
the
sake
of
more
dynamic
more
adaptable
economy
that
all
for
the
good
but
that
idea
has
always
been
combined
with
commitment
to
equality
of
opportunity
to
upward
mobility
the
idea
that
no
matter
how
poor
you
started
if
you
willing
to
work
hard
and
discipline
yourself
and
defer
gratification
you
can
make
it
too
that
the
american
idea
unfortunately
opportunities
for
upward
mobility
in
america
have
gotten
harder
to
find
over
the
past
years
and
betrayal
of
the
american
idea
and
why
we
have
to
do
lot
more
to
give
every
american
the
chance
to
work
their
way
into
the
middle
class
the
best
against
all
of
these
forces
global
competition
economic
is
the
strength
of
the
community
so
we
need
new
push
to
rebuild
rundown
we
need
new
partnerships
with
some
of
the
towns
in
america
to
get
them
back
on
their
feet
and
because
no
one
who
works
in
america
should
have
to
live
in
poverty
am
going
to
keep
making
the
case
that
we
need
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
because
it
lower
right
now
than
it
was
when
took
office
it
time
for
the
minimum
wage
to
go
up
we
not
people
who
allow
chance
of
birth
to
decide
biggest
winners
or
losers
and
after
years
in
which
seen
how
easy
it
can
be
for
any
of
us
to
fall
on
hard
times
folks
in
folks
in
the
cities
you
know
there
are
good
people
who
work
hard
and
sometimes
they
get
bad
break
plant
leaves
somebody
gets
sick
somebody
loses
home
we
seen
it
in
our
family
in
our
friends
and
our
we
seen
it
happen
and
that
means
we
can
not
turn
our
backs
when
bad
breaks
hit
any
of
our
fellow
citizens
so
good
jobs
better
bargain
for
the
middle
class
and
the
folks
who
are
working
to
get
into
the
middle
class
an
economy
that
grows
from
the
middle
out
not
the
top
down
that
where
will
focus
my
energies
that
where
will
focus
my
energies
not
just
for
the
next
few
months
but
for
the
remainder
of
my
presidency
these
are
the
plans
that
lay
out
across
this
country
but
be
able
to
do
it
alone
so
going
to
be
calling
on
all
of
us
to
take
up
this
cause
need
our
businesses
who
are
some
of
the
best
in
the
world
to
pressure
congress
to
invest
in
our
future
and
be
asking
our
businesses
to
set
an
example
by
providing
decent
wages
and
salaries
to
their
own
employees
and
going
to
highlight
the
ones
that
do
just
that
there
are
companies
like
which
pays
good
wages
and
offers
good
benefits
companies
like
there
are
companies
like
the
container
store
that
prides
itself
on
training
its
employees
and
on
employee
satisfaction
because
these
companies
prove
that
not
just
good
for
the
employees
good
for
their
businesses
to
treat
workers
well
good
for
america
so
going
to
be
calling
on
the
private
sector
to
step
up
will
be
saying
to
democrats
got
to
question
some
of
our
old
assumptions
got
to
be
willing
to
redesign
or
get
rid
of
programs
that
do
work
as
well
as
they
should
got
to
be
willing
to
got
to
embrace
changes
to
cherished
priorities
so
that
they
work
better
in
this
new
age
we
just
democrats
just
stand
pat
and
just
defend
whatever
government
is
doing
if
we
believe
that
government
can
give
the
middle
class
fair
shot
in
this
new
century
and
believe
that
an
obligation
to
prove
it
and
that
means
that
got
to
be
open
to
new
ways
of
doing
things
and
need
republicans
in
congress
to
set
aside
politics
and
work
with
me
to
find
common
ground
interesting
in
the
to
this
lot
of
reporters
say
that
well
president
these
are
all
good
ideas
but
some
of
said
before
some
of
them
sound
great
but
you
get
those
through
congress
republicans
agree
with
you
and
say
look
the
fact
is
there
are
republicans
in
congress
right
now
who
privately
agree
with
me
on
lot
of
the
ideas
be
proposing
know
because
said
so
but
they
worry
face
swift
political
retaliation
for
cooperating
with
me
now
there
are
others
who
will
dismiss
every
idea
put
forward
either
because
playing
to
their
most
strident
supporters
or
in
some
cases
because
sincerely
they
have
fundamentally
different
vision
for
america
one
that
says
inequality
is
both
inevitable
and
just
one
that
says
an
unfettered
free
market
without
any
restraints
inevitably
produces
the
best
outcomes
regardless
of
the
pain
and
uncertainty
imposed
on
ordinary
families
and
government
is
the
problem
and
we
should
just
shrink
it
as
small
as
we
can
in
either
case
say
to
these
members
of
congress
laying
out
my
ideas
to
give
the
middle
class
better
shot
so
now
time
for
you
to
lay
out
your
ideas
you
just
be
against
something
you
got
to
be
for
something
even
if
you
think
done
everything
wrong
the
trends
just
talked
about
were
happening
well
before
took
office
so
not
enough
for
you
just
to
oppose
me
you
got
to
be
for
something
what
are
your
ideas
if
willing
to
work
with
me
to
strengthen
american
manufacturing
and
rebuild
this
infrastructure
go
if
got
better
ideas
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
college
for
working
families
hear
them
if
you
think
you
have
better
plan
for
making
sure
that
every
american
has
the
security
of
quality
affordable
health
care
then
stop
taking
meaningless
repeal
votes
and
share
your
concrete
ideas
with
the
country
repealing
and
cutting
spending
is
not
an
economic
plan
not
if
serious
about
balanced
fiscal
plan
that
replaces
the
mindless
cuts
currently
in
place
or
if
interested
in
tax
reform
that
closes
corporate
loopholes
and
gives
working
families
better
deal
ready
to
work
but
you
should
know
that
will
not
accept
deals
that
meet
the
basic
test
of
strengthening
the
prospects
of
hardworking
families
this
is
the
agenda
we
have
to
be
working
on
come
long
way
since
first
took
office
as
country
older
and
wiser
know
if
wiser
but
certainly
older
and
as
long
as
congress
manufacture
another
crisis
as
long
as
we
shut
down
the
government
just
because
for
keeping
it
open
as
long
as
we
risk
default
over
paying
bills
that
already
racked
up
something
that
never
done
we
can
probably
muddle
along
without
taking
bold
action
if
we
stand
pat
and
we
do
any
of
the
things
talked
about
our
economy
will
grow
although
slower
than
it
should
new
businesses
will
form
the
unemployment
rate
will
probably
tick
down
little
bit
just
by
virtue
of
our
size
and
our
natural
resources
and
most
of
all
because
of
the
talent
of
our
people
america
will
remain
world
power
and
the
majority
of
us
will
figure
out
how
to
get
by
but
you
know
what
our
choice
if
we
just
stand
by
and
do
nothing
in
the
face
of
immense
change
understand
that
part
of
our
character
will
be
lost
our
founding
precepts
about
opportunity
each
generation
doing
better
than
the
last
that
will
be
myth
not
reality
the
position
of
the
middle
class
will
erode
further
inequality
will
continue
to
increase
power
will
distort
our
politics
even
more
social
tensions
will
rise
as
various
groups
fight
to
hold
on
to
what
they
have
or
start
blaming
somebody
else
for
why
their
position
improving
and
the
fundamental
optimism
always
propelled
us
forward
will
give
way
to
cynicism
or
nostalgia
and
not
the
vision
have
for
this
country
not
the
vision
you
have
for
this
country
not
the
america
we
know
not
the
vision
we
should
be
settling
for
not
vision
we
should
be
passing
on
to
our
children
have
now
run
my
last
campaign
do
not
intend
to
wait
until
the
next
campaign
or
the
next
president
before
tackling
the
issues
that
matter
care
about
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
and
how
to
use
every
minute
the
only
thing
care
about
is
how
to
use
every
minute
of
the
remaining
days
of
my
term
to
make
this
country
work
for
working
americans
again
all
care
about
have
another
election
because
tell
you
where
believe
america
needs
to
go
believe
where
the
american
people
want
to
go
and
it
may
seem
hard
today
but
if
willing
to
take
few
bold
steps
if
washington
will
just
shake
off
its
complacency
and
set
aside
the
kind
of
partisanship
that
just
seen
for
way
too
long
if
we
just
make
some
decisions
our
economy
will
be
stronger
year
from
now
it
will
be
stronger
five
years
from
now
it
will
be
stronger
years
from
now
if
we
focus
on
what
matters
then
more
americans
will
know
the
pride
of
that
first
more
americans
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
flipping
the
sign
to
on
their
own
business
more
americans
will
have
the
joy
of
scratching
the
height
of
their
kid
on
that
door
of
their
home
and
in
the
end
is
that
what
makes
us
special
it
not
the
ability
to
generate
incredible
wealth
for
the
few
it
our
ability
to
give
everybody
chance
to
pursue
their
own
true
measure
of
happiness
we
just
wanted
success
for
ourselves
we
want
it
for
our
too
when
we
think
about
our
own
communities
we
not
mean
people
we
not
selfish
people
we
not
people
that
just
looks
out
for
why
should
our
politics
reflect
those
kinds
of
values
why
we
call
it
dream
or
dream
or
dream
or
pat
dream
we
call
it
the
american
dream
and
what
makes
this
country
special
the
idea
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
what
you
look
like
or
where
you
come
from
or
who
you
love
you
can
make
it
if
you
try
what
we
fighting
for
so
yes
congress
is
tough
right
now
but
not
going
to
stop
me
we
going
to
do
everything
we
can
wherever
we
can
with
or
without
congress
to
make
things
happen
we
going
to
go
on
the
road
and
talk
to
you
and
you
have
ideas
and
we
want
to
see
which
ones
we
can
implement
but
we
going
to
focus
on
this
thing
that
matters
one
of
greatest
writers
born
right
here
in
over
century
ago
he
saw
the
bring
the
world
to
the
prairie
and
then
the
prairie
sent
out
its
bounty
to
the
world
and
he
saw
the
advent
of
new
industries
new
technologies
and
he
watched
populations
shift
he
saw
fortunes
made
and
lost
and
he
saw
how
change
could
be
painful
how
new
age
could
unsettle
customs
and
ways
of
life
but
he
had
that
frontier
optimism
and
so
he
saw
something
more
on
the
horizon
and
he
wrote
speak
of
new
cities
and
new
people
the
past
is
bucket
of
ashes
yesterday
is
wind
gone
down
sun
dropped
in
the
west
there
is
only
an
ocean
of
tomorrows
sky
of
well
america
made
it
through
the
worst
of
winds
we
just
have
to
have
the
courage
to
keep
moving
forward
we
got
to
set
our
eyes
on
the
horizon
we
will
find
an
ocean
of
tomorrows
we
will
find
sky
of
tomorrows
for
the
american
people
and
for
this
great
country
that
we
love
so
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
well
wanted
to
come
out
here
first
of
all
to
tell
you
that
jay
is
prepared
for
all
your
questions
and
is
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
session
the
second
thing
is
want
to
let
you
know
that
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
going
to
obviously
be
whole
range
of
issues
immigration
economics
we
try
to
arrange
fuller
press
conference
to
address
your
questions
the
reason
actually
wanted
to
come
out
today
is
not
to
take
questions
but
to
speak
to
an
issue
that
obviously
has
gotten
lot
of
attention
over
the
course
of
the
last
week
the
issue
of
the
martin
ruling
gave
preliminary
statement
right
after
the
ruling
on
sunday
but
watching
the
debate
over
the
course
of
the
last
week
thought
it
might
be
useful
for
me
to
expand
on
my
thoughts
little
bit
first
of
all
want
to
make
sure
that
once
again
send
my
thoughts
and
prayers
as
well
as
to
the
family
of
martin
and
to
remark
on
the
incredible
grace
and
dignity
with
which
dealt
with
the
entire
situation
can
only
imagine
what
going
through
and
remarkable
how
handled
it
the
second
thing
want
to
say
is
to
reiterate
what
said
on
sunday
which
is
going
to
be
lot
of
arguments
about
the
legal
issues
in
the
case
let
all
the
legal
analysts
and
talking
heads
address
those
issues
the
judge
conducted
the
trial
in
professional
manner
the
prosecution
and
the
made
their
arguments
the
juries
were
properly
instructed
that
in
case
such
as
this
reasonable
doubt
was
relevant
and
they
rendered
verdict
and
once
the
jury
has
spoken
that
how
our
system
works
but
did
want
to
just
talk
little
bit
about
context
and
how
people
have
responded
to
it
and
how
people
are
feeling
you
know
when
martin
was
first
shot
said
that
this
could
have
been
my
son
another
way
of
saying
that
is
martin
could
have
been
me
years
ago
and
when
you
think
about
why
in
the
african
american
community
at
least
lot
of
pain
around
what
happened
here
think
important
to
that
the
african
american
community
is
looking
at
this
issue
through
set
of
experiences
and
history
that
go
away
there
are
very
few
african
american
men
in
this
country
who
have
had
the
experience
of
being
followed
when
they
were
shopping
in
department
store
that
includes
me
there
are
very
few
african
american
men
who
have
had
the
experience
of
walking
across
the
street
and
hearing
the
locks
click
on
the
doors
of
cars
that
happens
to
me
at
least
before
was
senator
there
are
very
few
african
americans
who
have
had
the
experience
of
getting
on
an
elevator
and
woman
clutching
her
purse
nervously
and
holding
her
breath
until
she
had
chance
to
get
off
that
happens
often
and
do
want
to
exaggerate
this
but
those
sets
of
experiences
inform
how
the
african
american
community
interprets
what
happened
one
night
in
florida
and
inescapable
for
people
to
bring
those
experiences
to
bear
the
african
american
community
is
also
knowledgeable
that
there
is
history
of
racial
disparities
in
the
application
of
our
criminal
laws
everything
from
the
death
penalty
to
enforcement
of
our
drug
laws
and
that
ends
up
having
an
impact
in
terms
of
how
people
interpret
the
case
now
this
is
to
say
that
the
african
american
community
is
about
the
fact
that
african
american
young
men
are
disproportionately
involved
in
the
criminal
justice
system
that
disproportionately
both
victims
and
perpetrators
of
violence
not
to
make
excuses
for
that
fact
although
black
folks
do
interpret
the
reasons
for
that
in
historical
context
they
understand
that
some
of
the
violence
that
takes
place
in
poor
black
around
the
country
is
born
out
of
very
violent
past
in
this
country
and
that
the
poverty
and
dysfunction
that
we
see
in
those
communities
can
be
traced
to
very
difficult
history
and
so
the
fact
that
sometimes
unacknowledged
adds
to
the
frustration
and
the
fact
that
lot
of
african
american
boys
are
painted
with
broad
brush
and
the
excuse
is
given
well
there
are
these
statistics
out
there
that
show
that
african
american
boys
are
more
violent
using
that
as
an
excuse
to
then
see
sons
treated
differently
causes
pain
think
the
african
american
community
is
also
not
in
understanding
that
statistically
somebody
like
martin
was
statistically
more
likely
to
be
shot
by
peer
than
he
was
by
somebody
else
so
folks
understand
the
challenges
that
exist
for
african
american
boys
but
they
get
frustrated
think
if
they
feel
that
no
context
for
it
and
that
context
is
being
denied
and
that
all
contributes
think
to
sense
that
if
white
male
teen
was
involved
in
the
same
kind
of
scenario
that
from
top
to
bottom
both
the
outcome
and
the
aftermath
might
have
been
different
now
the
question
for
me
at
least
and
think
for
lot
of
folks
is
where
do
we
take
this
how
do
we
learn
some
lessons
from
this
and
move
in
positive
direction
think
understandable
that
there
have
been
demonstrations
and
vigils
and
protests
and
some
of
that
stuff
is
just
going
to
have
to
work
its
way
through
as
long
as
it
remains
nonviolent
if
see
any
violence
then
will
remind
folks
that
that
what
happened
to
martin
and
his
family
but
beyond
protests
or
vigils
the
question
is
are
there
some
concrete
things
that
we
might
be
able
to
do
know
that
holder
is
reviewing
what
happened
down
there
but
think
important
for
people
to
have
some
clear
expectations
here
traditionally
these
are
issues
of
state
and
local
government
the
criminal
code
and
law
enforcement
is
traditionally
done
at
the
state
and
local
levels
not
at
the
federal
levels
that
mean
though
that
as
nation
we
do
some
things
that
think
would
be
productive
so
let
me
just
give
couple
of
specifics
that
still
bouncing
around
with
my
staff
so
not
rolling
out
some
plan
but
some
areas
where
think
all
of
us
could
potentially
focus
number
one
precisely
because
law
enforcement
is
often
determined
at
the
state
and
local
level
think
it
would
be
productive
for
the
justice
department
governors
mayors
to
work
with
law
enforcement
about
training
at
the
state
and
local
levels
in
order
to
reduce
the
kind
of
mistrust
in
the
system
that
sometimes
currently
exists
when
was
in
illinois
passed
racial
profiling
legislation
and
it
actually
did
just
two
simple
things
one
it
collected
data
on
traffic
stops
and
the
race
of
the
person
who
was
stopped
but
the
other
thing
was
it
resourced
us
training
police
departments
across
the
state
on
how
to
think
about
potential
racial
bias
and
ways
to
further
what
they
were
doing
and
initially
the
police
departments
across
the
state
were
resistant
but
actually
they
came
to
that
if
it
was
done
in
fair
straightforward
way
that
it
would
allow
them
to
do
their
jobs
better
and
communities
would
have
more
confidence
in
them
and
in
turn
be
more
helpful
in
applying
the
law
and
obviously
law
enforcement
has
got
very
tough
job
so
one
area
where
think
there
are
lot
of
resources
and
best
practices
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
if
state
and
local
governments
are
receptive
and
think
lot
of
them
would
be
and
let
figure
out
are
there
ways
for
us
to
push
out
that
kind
of
training
along
the
same
lines
think
it
would
be
useful
for
us
to
examine
some
state
and
local
laws
to
see
if
it
if
they
are
designed
in
such
way
that
they
may
encourage
the
kinds
of
altercations
and
confrontations
and
tragedies
that
we
saw
in
the
florida
case
rather
than
diffuse
potential
altercations
know
that
there
been
commentary
about
the
fact
that
the
stand
your
ground
laws
in
florida
were
not
used
as
in
the
case
on
the
other
hand
if
we
sending
message
as
society
in
our
communities
that
someone
who
is
armed
potentially
has
the
right
to
use
those
firearms
even
if
there
way
for
them
to
exit
from
situation
is
that
really
going
to
be
contributing
to
the
kind
of
peace
and
security
and
order
that
we
like
to
see
and
for
those
who
resist
that
idea
that
we
should
think
about
something
like
these
stand
your
ground
laws
just
ask
people
to
consider
if
martin
was
of
age
and
armed
could
he
have
stood
his
ground
on
that
sidewalk
and
do
we
actually
think
that
he
would
have
been
justified
in
shooting
who
had
followed
him
in
car
because
he
felt
threatened
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
at
least
ambiguous
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
might
want
to
examine
those
kinds
of
laws
number
three
and
this
is
project
we
need
to
spend
some
time
in
thinking
about
how
do
we
bolster
and
reinforce
our
african
american
boys
and
this
is
something
that
and
talk
lot
about
there
are
lot
of
kids
out
there
who
need
help
who
are
getting
lot
of
negative
reinforcement
and
is
there
more
that
we
can
do
to
give
them
the
sense
that
their
country
cares
about
them
and
values
them
and
is
willing
to
invest
in
them
not
about
the
prospects
of
some
grand
new
federal
program
not
sure
that
what
we
talking
about
here
but
do
that
as
president
got
some
convening
power
and
there
are
lot
of
good
programs
that
are
being
done
across
the
country
on
this
front
and
for
us
to
be
able
to
gather
together
business
leaders
and
local
elected
officials
and
clergy
and
celebrities
and
athletes
and
figure
out
how
are
we
doing
better
job
helping
young
african
american
men
feel
that
they
full
part
of
this
society
and
that
they
got
pathways
and
avenues
to
succeed
think
that
would
be
pretty
good
outcome
from
what
was
obviously
tragic
situation
and
we
going
to
spend
some
time
working
on
that
and
thinking
about
that
and
then
finally
think
it
going
to
be
important
for
all
of
us
to
do
some
there
has
been
talk
about
should
we
convene
conversation
on
race
have
seen
that
be
particularly
productive
when
politicians
try
to
conversations
they
end
up
being
stilted
and
and
folks
are
locked
into
the
positions
they
already
have
on
the
other
hand
in
families
and
churches
and
workplaces
there
the
possibility
that
people
are
little
bit
more
honest
and
at
least
you
ask
yourself
your
own
questions
about
am
wringing
as
much
bias
out
of
myself
as
can
am
judging
people
as
much
as
can
based
on
not
the
of
their
skin
but
the
content
of
their
character
that
would
think
be
an
appropriate
exercise
in
the
wake
of
this
tragedy
and
let
me
just
leave
you
with
final
thought
that
as
difficult
and
challenging
as
this
whole
episode
has
been
for
lot
of
people
want
us
to
lose
sight
that
things
are
getting
better
each
successive
generation
seems
to
be
making
progress
in
changing
attitudes
when
it
comes
to
race
it
mean
in
society
it
mean
that
racism
is
eliminated
but
when
talk
to
and
and
listen
to
their
friends
and
seem
them
interact
better
than
we
are
better
than
we
were
on
these
issues
and
true
in
every
community
that
visited
all
across
the
country
and
so
we
have
to
be
vigilant
and
we
have
to
work
on
these
issues
and
those
of
us
in
authority
should
be
doing
everything
we
can
to
encourage
the
better
angels
of
our
nature
as
opposed
to
using
these
episodes
to
heighten
divisions
but
we
should
also
have
confidence
that
kids
these
days
think
have
more
sense
than
we
did
back
then
and
certainly
more
than
our
parents
did
or
our
grandparents
did
and
that
along
this
long
difficult
journey
becoming
more
perfect
union
not
perfect
union
but
more
perfect
union
thank
you
guys
president
hello
cape
town
audience
hello
president
audience
president
see
been
did
leave
anybody
out
all
right
well
want
to
leave
anybody
out
here
want
to
thank
vice
chancellor
price
here
as
well
as
archbishop
wonderful
to
have
them
in
attendance
am
so
happy
to
be
here
today
it
is
wonderful
to
see
all
of
these
outstanding
young
people
just
had
the
of
going
to
island
with
and
our
two
daughters
this
afternoon
and
this
was
my
second
time
had
the
chance
to
visit
back
in
but
there
was
something
different
about
bringing
my
children
and
is
now
is
and
seeing
them
stand
within
the
walls
that
once
surrounded
mandela
knew
this
was
an
experience
that
they
would
never
forget
knew
that
they
now
appreciated
little
bit
more
the
sacrifices
that
and
others
had
made
for
freedom
but
what
also
know
is
that
because
had
chance
to
visit
south
africa
for
second
time
now
they
also
understand
that
spirit
could
never
be
imprisoned
for
his
legacy
is
here
for
all
to
see
in
this
auditorium
young
people
black
white
indian
everything
in
between
living
and
learning
together
in
south
africa
that
is
free
and
at
peace
now
obviously
today
health
weighs
heavily
on
our
hearts
and
like
billions
all
over
the
world
and
the
american
people
have
drawn
strength
from
the
example
of
this
extraordinary
leader
and
the
nation
that
he
changed
mandela
showed
us
that
one
courage
can
move
the
world
and
he
calls
on
us
to
make
choices
that
reflects
not
our
fears
but
our
hopes
in
our
own
lives
and
in
the
lives
of
our
communities
and
our
countries
and
what
want
to
speak
to
all
of
you
about
today
some
of
you
may
be
aware
of
this
but
actually
took
my
first
step
into
political
life
because
of
south
africa
this
is
true
was
the
same
age
as
some
of
you
years
old
my
whole
life
ahead
of
me
was
going
to
school
on
campus
in
california
not
quite
as
pretty
as
this
one
but
similar
and
must
confess
was
not
always
focused
on
my
studies
there
were
lot
of
distractions
and
enjoyed
those
distractions
and
as
the
son
of
an
african
father
and
white
american
mother
the
diversity
of
america
was
in
my
blood
but
had
never
cared
much
for
politics
think
it
mattered
to
me
think
could
make
difference
and
like
many
young
people
thought
that
cynicism
certain
ironic
detachment
was
sign
of
wisdom
and
sophistication
but
then
learned
what
was
happening
here
in
south
africa
and
two
young
men
representatives
came
to
our
college
and
spoke
and
spent
time
hearing
their
stories
and
learned
about
the
courage
of
those
who
waged
the
defiance
campaign
and
the
brutality
against
innocent
men
women
and
children
from
to
soweto
and
studied
the
leadership
of
and
the
words
of
and
the
example
of
and
knew
that
while
brave
people
were
imprisoned
just
off
these
shores
on
island
my
own
government
in
the
united
states
was
not
standing
on
their
side
why
got
involved
in
what
was
known
as
the
movement
in
the
united
states
it
was
the
first
time
ever
attached
myself
to
cause
it
was
the
first
time
also
that
ever
gave
it
was
only
two
minutes
long
and
was
really
just
act
at
rally
that
we
were
holding
demanding
that
our
college
divest
from
south
africa
so
got
up
on
stage
started
making
my
and
then
as
bit
of
political
some
people
came
out
with
glasses
that
looked
like
security
officers
and
they
dragged
me
off
the
stage
fortunately
there
are
no
records
of
this
but
remember
struggling
to
express
the
anger
and
the
passion
that
was
feeling
and
to
echo
in
some
small
way
the
moral
clarity
of
freedom
fighters
an
ocean
away
and
be
honest
with
you
when
was
done
did
not
think
made
any
difference
was
even
little
embarrassed
and
thought
to
myself
bunch
of
university
kids
doing
in
california
that
is
somehow
going
to
make
difference
it
felt
too
distant
from
what
people
were
going
through
in
places
like
soweto
but
looking
back
as
look
at
that
old
young
man
more
forgiving
of
the
fact
that
the
might
not
have
been
that
great
because
knew
know
now
that
something
inside
me
was
stirring
at
that
time
something
important
and
that
was
the
belief
that
could
be
part
of
something
bigger
than
myself
that
my
own
salvation
was
bound
up
with
those
of
others
what
bobby
kennedy
expressed
far
better
than
ever
could
when
he
spoke
here
at
the
university
of
cape
town
in
he
said
time
man
stands
up
for
an
ideal
or
acts
to
improve
the
lot
of
others
or
strikes
out
against
injustice
he
sends
forth
tiny
ripple
of
hope
and
crossing
each
other
from
million
different
of
energy
and
daring
those
ripples
build
current
which
can
sweep
down
the
mightiest
walls
of
oppression
and
now
the
world
was
very
different
on
that
june
day
in
when
bobby
kennedy
spoke
those
words
mandela
faced
many
more
years
as
prisoner
was
entrenched
in
this
land
in
the
united
states
the
victories
of
the
civil
rights
movement
were
still
uncertain
in
fact
on
the
very
day
that
kennedy
spoke
here
the
american
civil
rights
leader
james
was
shot
in
where
he
was
marching
to
inspire
blacks
to
register
to
vote
those
were
difficult
troubled
trying
times
the
idea
of
hope
might
have
seemed
misplaced
it
would
have
seemed
inconceivable
to
people
at
that
time
that
less
than
years
later
an
african
american
president
might
address
an
integrated
audience
at
south
oldest
university
and
that
this
same
university
would
have
conferred
an
honorary
degree
to
president
mandela
it
would
have
seemed
impossible
the
power
that
comes
from
acting
on
our
ideals
what
mandela
understood
but
it
just
the
giants
of
history
who
brought
about
this
change
think
of
the
many
millions
of
acts
of
conscience
that
were
part
of
that
effort
think
about
how
many
voices
were
raised
against
injustice
over
the
years
in
this
country
in
the
united
states
around
the
world
think
of
how
many
times
ordinary
people
pushed
against
those
walls
of
oppression
and
resistance
and
the
violence
and
the
indignities
that
they
suffered
the
quiet
courage
that
they
sustained
think
of
how
many
ripples
of
hope
it
took
to
build
wave
that
would
eventually
come
crashing
down
like
mighty
stream
so
life
like
life
like
gandhi
life
like
the
life
of
all
those
who
fought
to
bring
about
new
south
africa
or
more
just
america
they
stand
as
challenge
to
me
but
more
importantly
they
stand
as
challenge
to
your
generation
because
they
tell
you
that
your
voice
matters
your
ideals
your
willingness
to
act
on
those
ideals
your
choices
can
make
difference
and
if
any
country
in
the
world
that
shows
the
power
of
human
beings
to
affect
change
this
is
the
one
shown
us
how
prisoner
can
become
president
you
shown
us
how
bitter
adversaries
can
reconcile
you
confronted
crimes
of
hatred
and
intolerance
with
truth
and
love
and
you
wrote
into
your
constitution
the
human
rights
that
sustain
freedom
and
those
are
only
the
most
aspects
of
south
transformation
because
alongside
south
political
struggle
other
battles
have
been
waged
as
well
to
improve
the
lives
of
those
who
for
far
too
long
have
been
denied
economic
opportunity
and
social
justice
during
my
last
journey
here
in
what
impressed
me
so
much
was
the
good
works
of
people
on
the
ground
teaching
children
caring
for
the
sick
bringing
jobs
to
those
in
need
in
township
still
working
on
some
of
these
met
women
who
were
living
with
and
this
is
at
time
back
in
where
there
were
still
some
challenges
in
terms
of
the
policies
around
and
aids
here
in
south
africa
but
they
were
on
the
ground
struggling
to
keep
their
families
together
helping
each
other
working
on
behalf
of
each
other
in
soweto
met
people
who
were
striving
to
carry
forward
the
legacy
of
hector
at
the
parks
library
in
pretoria
was
struck
by
the
energy
of
students
who
they
wanted
to
capture
this
moment
of
promise
for
south
africa
and
this
is
moment
of
great
promise
south
africa
is
one
of
the
economic
obviously
you
can
see
it
here
in
cape
town
in
the
country
that
saw
the
first
human
heart
transplant
new
breakthroughs
are
being
made
in
the
treatment
of
was
just
talking
to
your
vice
chancellor
people
come
to
this
university
from
over
countries
to
study
and
teach
in
america
we
see
the
reach
of
your
culture
from
concerts
to
the
we
got
the
just
couple
of
blocks
from
the
white
house
and
thanks
to
the
first
world
cup
ever
held
on
this
continent
the
world
now
knows
the
sound
of
the
not
sure
that
like
the
greatest
gift
that
south
africa
ever
gave
but
progress
has
also
rippled
across
the
african
continent
from
senegal
to
to
malawi
democracy
has
weathered
strong
challenges
many
of
the
economies
in
the
world
are
here
in
africa
where
there
is
an
historic
shift
taking
place
from
poverty
to
growing
nascent
middle
class
fewer
people
are
dying
of
preventable
disease
more
people
have
access
to
health
care
more
farmers
are
getting
their
products
to
market
at
fair
prices
from
projects
in
kampala
to
stock
traders
in
lagos
to
cell
phone
entrepreneurs
in
nairobi
there
is
an
energy
here
that
be
denied
africa
rising
we
know
this
progress
though
rests
on
fragile
foundation
we
know
that
progress
is
uneven
across
africa
the
same
institutions
that
should
be
the
backbone
of
democracy
can
all
too
often
be
infected
with
the
rot
of
corruption
the
same
technology
that
enables
record
profits
sometimes
means
widening
canyon
of
inequality
the
same
interconnection
that
binds
our
fates
makes
all
of
africa
vulnerable
to
the
of
conflict
so
there
is
no
question
that
africa
is
on
the
move
but
it
not
moving
fast
enough
for
the
child
still
languishing
in
poverty
in
forgotten
townships
it
not
moving
fast
enough
for
the
protester
who
is
beaten
in
harare
or
the
woman
who
is
raped
in
eastern
congo
we
got
more
work
to
do
because
these
africans
must
not
be
left
behind
and
where
you
come
in
the
young
people
of
africa
just
like
previous
generations
you
got
choices
to
make
you
get
to
decide
where
the
future
lies
think
about
it
over
percent
of
africans
are
under
years
old
so
demographics
means
young
people
are
going
to
be
determining
the
fate
of
this
continent
and
this
country
got
time
and
numbers
on
your
side
and
be
making
decisions
long
after
politicians
like
me
have
left
the
scene
and
can
promise
you
this
the
world
will
be
watching
what
decisions
you
make
the
world
will
be
watching
what
you
do
because
one
of
the
wonderful
things
happening
is
where
people
used
to
only
see
suffering
and
conflict
in
africa
suddenly
now
they
seeing
opportunity
for
resources
for
investment
for
partnership
for
influence
governments
and
businesses
from
around
the
world
are
sizing
up
the
continent
and
they
making
decisions
themselves
about
where
to
invest
their
own
time
and
their
own
energy
and
as
said
yesterday
at
town
hall
meeting
up
in
good
thing
we
want
all
countries
china
india
brazil
turkey
europe
america
we
want
everybody
paying
attention
to
what
going
on
here
because
it
speaks
to
your
progress
and
to
africa
on
this
trip
because
my
bet
is
on
the
young
people
who
are
the
heartbeat
of
story
betting
on
all
of
you
as
president
of
the
united
states
believe
that
my
own
nation
will
benefit
enormously
if
you
reach
your
full
potential
if
prosperity
is
broadly
shared
here
in
africa
that
middle
class
will
be
an
enormous
market
for
our
goods
if
strong
democracies
take
root
that
will
enable
our
people
and
businesses
to
draw
closer
to
yours
if
peace
prevails
over
war
we
will
all
be
more
secure
and
if
the
dignity
of
the
individual
is
upheld
across
africa
then
believe
americans
will
be
more
free
as
well
because
believe
that
none
of
us
are
fully
free
when
others
in
the
human
family
remain
shackled
by
poverty
or
disease
or
oppression
now
america
has
been
involved
in
africa
for
decades
but
we
are
moving
beyond
the
simple
provision
of
assistance
foreign
aid
to
new
model
of
partnership
between
america
and
africa
partnership
of
equals
that
focuses
on
your
capacity
to
solve
problems
and
your
capacity
to
grow
our
efforts
focus
on
three
areas
that
shape
our
lives
opportunity
democracy
and
peace
so
first
off
we
want
partnership
that
empowers
africans
to
access
greater
opportunity
in
their
own
lives
in
their
communities
and
for
their
countries
as
the
largest
economy
on
the
continent
south
africa
is
part
of
trend
that
extends
from
south
to
north
east
to
west
more
and
more
african
economies
are
poised
to
take
off
and
increased
trade
and
investment
from
the
united
states
has
the
potential
to
accelerate
these
trends
creating
new
jobs
and
opportunities
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
so
calling
for
america
to
up
our
game
when
it
comes
to
africa
bringing
together
business
leaders
from
america
and
africa
to
deepen
our
engagement
going
to
launch
new
trade
missions
and
promote
investment
from
companies
back
home
launch
an
effort
in
to
renew
the
african
growth
and
opportunity
act
to
break
down
barriers
to
trade
and
tomorrow
discuss
new
trade
africa
initiative
to
expand
our
ties
across
the
continent
because
we
want
to
unleash
the
power
of
entrepreneurship
and
markets
to
create
opportunity
here
africa
it
was
interesting
yesterday
at
the
town
hall
meeting
had
with
number
of
young
people
the
first
three
questions
had
to
do
with
trade
because
there
was
recognition
these
young
people
said
want
to
start
want
to
start
something
want
to
build
something
and
then
want
to
sell
something
now
to
succeed
these
efforts
have
to
connect
to
something
bigger
and
for
america
this
just
about
numbers
on
balance
sheet
or
the
resources
that
can
be
taken
out
of
the
ground
we
believe
that
societies
and
economies
only
advance
as
far
as
individuals
are
free
to
carry
them
forward
and
just
as
freedom
can
not
exist
when
people
are
imprisoned
for
their
political
views
true
opportunity
can
not
exist
when
people
are
imprisoned
by
sickness
or
hunger
or
darkness
and
so
the
question
we
been
asking
ourselves
is
what
will
it
take
to
empower
individual
africans
for
one
thing
we
believe
that
countries
have
to
have
the
power
to
feed
themselves
so
instead
of
shipping
food
to
africa
now
helping
millions
of
small
farmers
in
africa
make
use
of
new
technologies
and
farm
more
land
and
through
new
alliance
of
governments
and
the
private
sector
investing
billions
of
dollars
in
agriculture
that
grows
more
crops
brings
more
food
to
market
give
farmers
better
prices
and
helps
lift
million
people
out
of
poverty
in
decade
an
end
to
famine
thriving
african
agricultural
industry
what
opportunity
looks
like
what
we
want
to
build
with
you
we
believe
that
countries
have
to
have
the
power
to
prevent
illness
and
care
for
the
sick
and
our
efforts
to
combat
malaria
and
tropical
illness
can
lead
to
an
achievable
goal
ending
child
and
maternal
deaths
from
preventable
disease
already
our
commitment
to
fight
has
saved
millions
and
allows
us
to
imagine
what
was
once
unthinkable
an
generation
and
while
america
will
continue
to
provide
billions
of
dollars
in
support
we
make
progress
without
african
partners
so
proud
that
by
the
end
of
my
presidency
south
africa
has
determined
it
will
be
the
first
african
country
to
fully
manage
its
care
and
treatment
program
an
enormous
achievement
healthy
mothers
and
healthy
children
strong
public
health
systems
what
opportunity
looks
like
and
we
believe
that
nations
must
have
the
power
to
connect
their
people
to
the
promise
of
the
century
access
to
electricity
is
fundamental
to
opportunity
in
this
age
the
light
that
children
study
by
the
energy
that
allows
an
idea
to
be
transformed
into
real
business
the
lifeline
for
families
to
meet
their
most
basic
needs
and
the
connection
needed
to
plug
africa
into
the
grid
of
the
global
economy
got
to
have
power
and
yet
of
the
population
in
africa
lacks
access
to
power
and
the
percentage
is
much
higher
for
those
who
live
in
cities
so
today
am
proud
to
announce
new
initiative
been
dealing
with
agriculture
been
dealing
with
health
now
going
to
talk
about
power
power
africa
new
initiative
that
will
double
access
to
power
in
africa
double
it
going
to
start
by
investing
billion
in
government
resources
going
to
partner
with
the
private
sector
who
themselves
have
committed
more
than
billion
in
investment
and
in
partnership
with
african
nations
going
to
develop
new
sources
of
energy
reach
more
households
not
just
in
cities
but
in
villages
and
on
farms
expand
access
for
those
who
live
currently
off
the
power
grid
and
support
clean
energy
to
protect
our
planet
and
combat
climate
change
so
light
where
currently
there
is
darkness
the
energy
needed
to
lift
people
out
of
poverty
what
opportunity
looks
like
so
this
is
vision
partnership
with
africa
that
unleashes
growth
and
the
potential
of
every
citizen
not
just
few
at
the
very
top
and
this
is
achievable
nothing
that
outlined
that
can
not
happen
but
history
tells
us
that
true
progress
is
only
possible
where
governments
exist
to
serve
their
people
and
not
the
other
way
around
if
anyone
wants
to
see
the
difference
between
freedom
and
tyranny
let
them
come
here
to
south
africa
here
citizens
braved
bullets
and
beatings
to
claim
that
most
basic
right
the
ability
to
be
free
to
determine
your
own
fate
in
your
own
land
and
example
extended
far
beyond
that
victory
now
mentioned
yesterday
at
the
town
hall
like
first
president
george
washington
he
understood
that
democracy
can
only
endure
when
bigger
than
just
one
person
so
his
willingness
to
leave
power
was
as
profound
as
his
ability
to
claim
power
the
good
news
is
that
this
example
is
getting
attention
across
the
continent
we
see
it
in
free
and
fair
elections
from
ghana
to
zambia
we
hear
it
in
the
voices
of
civil
society
was
in
senegal
and
met
with
some
civil
society
groups
including
group
called
which
meant
that
helped
to
defend
the
will
of
the
people
after
elections
in
senegal
we
it
in
places
like
tanzania
where
text
messages
connect
citizens
to
their
representatives
and
we
strengthen
it
when
stand
up
for
democratic
principles
like
did
in
but
this
work
is
not
complete
we
all
know
that
not
in
those
countries
where
leaders
enrich
themselves
with
impunity
not
in
communities
where
you
start
business
or
go
to
school
or
get
house
without
paying
bribe
to
somebody
these
things
have
to
change
and
they
have
to
chance
not
just
because
such
corruption
is
immoral
but
also
matter
of
and
economics
governments
that
respect
the
rights
of
their
citizens
and
abide
by
the
rule
of
law
do
better
grow
faster
draw
more
investment
than
those
who
just
fact
just
look
at
your
zimbabwe
where
the
promise
of
liberation
gave
way
to
the
corruption
of
power
and
then
the
collapse
of
the
economy
now
after
the
leaders
of
this
region
led
by
south
africa
brokered
an
end
to
what
has
been
crisis
have
new
constitution
the
economy
is
beginning
to
recover
so
there
is
an
opportunity
to
move
forward
but
only
if
there
is
an
election
that
is
free
and
fair
and
peaceful
so
that
can
determine
their
future
without
fear
of
intimidation
and
retribution
and
after
elections
there
must
be
respect
for
the
universal
rights
upon
which
democracy
depends
these
are
things
that
america
stands
for
not
perfectly
but
what
we
stand
for
and
what
my
administration
stands
for
we
tell
people
who
their
leaders
should
be
but
we
do
stand
up
with
those
who
support
the
principles
that
lead
to
better
life
and
why
interested
in
investing
not
in
strongmen
but
in
strong
institutions
independent
judiciaries
that
can
enforce
the
rule
of
law
honest
police
forces
that
can
protect
the
interests
instead
of
their
own
an
open
government
that
can
bring
transparency
and
accountability
and
yes
why
we
stand
up
for
civil
society
for
journalists
and
and
community
and
activists
who
give
people
voice
and
why
we
support
societies
that
empower
women
because
no
country
will
reach
its
potential
unless
it
draws
on
the
talents
of
our
wives
and
our
mothers
and
our
sisters
and
our
daughters
just
to
here
for
second
because
my
father
home
country
of
kenya
like
much
of
africa
you
see
women
doing
work
and
not
getting
respect
tell
you
you
can
measure
how
well
country
does
by
how
it
treats
its
women
and
all
across
this
continent
and
all
around
the
world
we
got
more
work
to
do
on
that
front
we
got
some
sisters
saying
amen
now
know
that
there
are
some
in
africa
who
hear
me
say
these
things
who
see
america
support
for
these
values
and
say
that
intrusive
why
are
you
meddling
know
there
are
those
who
argue
that
ideas
like
democracy
and
transparency
are
somehow
western
exports
disagree
those
in
power
who
make
those
arguments
are
usually
trying
to
distract
people
from
their
own
abuses
sometimes
they
are
the
same
people
who
behind
closed
doors
are
willing
to
sell
out
their
own
resource
to
foreign
interests
just
so
long
as
they
get
cut
just
telling
the
truth
now
ultimately
believe
that
africans
should
make
up
their
own
minds
about
what
serves
african
interests
we
trust
your
judgment
the
judgment
of
ordinary
people
we
believe
that
when
you
control
your
destiny
if
you
got
handle
on
your
governments
then
governments
will
promote
freedom
and
opportunity
because
that
will
serve
you
and
it
just
be
america
that
stands
up
for
democracy
it
should
be
africans
as
well
so
here
in
south
africa
your
democratic
story
has
inspired
the
world
and
through
the
power
of
your
example
and
through
your
position
in
like
and
the
african
union
you
can
be
voice
for
the
human
progress
that
written
into
your
own
constitution
you
should
assume
that
that
unique
to
south
africa
people
have
aspirations
like
that
everywhere
and
this
brings
me
to
the
final
area
where
our
partnership
can
empower
people
the
pursuit
and
protection
of
peace
in
africa
so
long
as
parts
of
africa
continue
to
be
ravaged
by
war
and
mayhem
opportunity
and
democracy
can
not
take
root
across
the
continent
there
are
places
where
too
often
fear
prevails
from
to
senseless
terrorism
all
too
often
perverts
the
meaning
of
islam
one
of
the
great
religions
and
takes
the
lives
of
countless
innocent
africans
from
congo
to
sudan
conflicts
fester
robbing
men
women
and
children
of
the
lives
that
they
deserve
in
too
many
countries
the
actions
of
thugs
and
warlords
and
drug
cartels
and
human
traffickers
hold
back
the
promise
of
africa
enslaving
others
for
their
own
purposes
america
can
not
put
stop
to
these
tragedies
alone
and
you
expect
us
to
job
for
africans
but
we
can
help
and
we
will
help
know
there
lot
of
talk
of
military
presence
in
africa
but
if
you
look
at
what
actually
doing
time
and
again
we
putting
muscle
behind
african
efforts
what
doing
in
the
where
the
nations
of
west
africa
have
stepped
forward
to
keep
the
peace
as
now
begins
to
rebuild
what
doing
in
central
africa
where
coalition
of
countries
is
closing
the
space
where
the
resistance
army
can
operate
what
doing
in
somalia
where
an
african
union
force
is
helping
new
government
to
stand
on
its
own
two
feet
these
efforts
have
to
lead
to
lasting
peace
not
just
words
on
paper
or
promises
that
fade
away
peace
between
and
within
sudan
and
south
sudan
so
that
these
governments
get
on
with
the
work
of
investing
in
their
deeply
impoverished
peoples
peace
in
the
congo
with
nations
keeping
their
commitments
so
rights
are
at
last
claimed
by
the
people
of
this
country
and
women
and
children
no
longer
live
in
fear
peace
in
where
people
will
make
their
voices
heard
in
new
elections
this
summer
in
each
of
these
cases
africa
must
lead
and
america
will
help
and
america
will
make
no
apology
for
supporting
african
efforts
to
end
conflict
and
stand
up
for
human
dignity
and
this
year
marks
the
anniversary
of
the
now
the
african
union
an
occasion
that
is
more
historic
because
the
is
taking
on
these
challenges
and
want
america
to
take
our
engagement
not
just
on
security
issues
but
on
environmental
issues
and
economic
issues
and
social
issues
education
issues
want
to
take
that
engagement
to
whole
new
level
so
proud
to
announce
that
next
year
going
to
invite
heads
of
state
from
across
africa
to
summit
in
the
united
states
to
help
launch
new
chapter
in
relations
and
as
mentioned
yesterday
also
going
to
hold
summit
with
the
next
class
of
our
young
african
leaders
initiative
because
we
want
to
engage
leaders
and
tomorrow
leaders
in
figuring
out
how
we
can
best
work
together
so
let
me
close
by
saying
this
governments
matter
political
leadership
matters
and
do
hope
that
some
of
you
here
today
decide
to
follow
the
path
of
public
service
it
can
sometimes
be
thankless
but
believe
it
can
also
be
noble
life
but
we
also
have
to
that
the
choices
we
make
are
not
limited
to
the
policies
and
programs
of
government
peace
and
prosperity
in
africa
and
around
the
world
also
depends
on
the
attitudes
of
people
too
often
the
source
of
tragedy
the
source
of
conflict
involves
the
choices
ordinary
people
make
that
divide
us
from
one
another
black
from
white
christian
from
muslim
tribe
from
tribe
africa
contains
multitude
of
identities
but
the
nations
and
people
of
africa
will
not
their
promise
so
long
as
some
use
these
identities
to
justify
subjugation
an
excuse
to
steal
or
kill
or
disenfranchise
others
and
ultimately
the
most
important
lesson
that
the
world
learned
right
here
in
south
africa
mandela
once
wrote
one
is
born
hating
another
person
because
of
the
of
his
skin
or
his
background
or
his
religion
people
must
learn
to
hate
and
if
they
can
learn
to
hate
they
can
be
taught
to
love
for
love
comes
more
naturally
to
the
human
heart
than
its
believe
that
to
be
true
believe
always
been
true
from
the
dawn
of
the
first
man
to
the
youth
today
and
all
that
came
in
between
here
in
africa
kingdoms
come
and
gone
the
crucible
of
slavery
and
the
emergence
from
colonialism
senseless
war
but
also
iconic
movements
for
social
justice
squandered
wealth
but
also
soaring
promise
words
give
us
compass
in
sea
of
change
firm
ground
amidst
swirling
currents
we
always
have
the
opportunity
to
choose
our
better
history
we
can
always
understand
that
most
important
decision
the
decision
we
make
when
we
find
our
common
humanity
in
one
another
always
available
to
us
that
choice
and
seen
that
spirit
in
the
welcoming
smiles
of
children
on
island
and
the
children
of
on
indian
ocean
coast
that
spirit
exists
in
the
mother
in
the
who
wants
life
of
dignity
for
her
daughters
and
in
the
south
african
student
who
braves
danger
and
distance
just
to
get
to
school
it
can
be
heard
in
the
songs
that
rise
from
villages
and
city
streets
and
it
can
be
heard
in
the
confident
voices
of
young
people
like
you
it
is
that
spirit
that
innate
longing
for
justice
and
equality
for
freedom
and
solidarity
the
spirit
that
can
light
the
way
forward
it
in
you
and
as
you
guide
africa
down
that
long
and
difficult
road
want
you
to
know
that
you
will
always
find
the
extended
hand
of
friend
in
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
very
much
god
bless
you
hello
berlin
thank
you
chancellor
for
your
leadership
your
friendship
and
the
example
of
your
life
from
child
of
the
east
to
the
leader
of
free
and
united
germany
as
said
and
exactly
look
like
previous
german
and
american
leaders
but
the
fact
that
we
can
stand
here
today
along
the
fault
line
where
city
was
divided
speaks
to
an
eternal
truth
no
wall
can
stand
against
the
yearning
of
justice
the
yearnings
for
freedom
the
yearnings
for
peace
that
burns
in
the
human
heart
mayor
distinguished
guests
and
especially
the
people
of
berlin
and
of
germany
thank
you
for
this
extraordinarily
warm
welcome
in
fact
it
so
warm
and
feel
so
good
that
actually
going
to
take
off
my
jacket
and
anybody
else
who
wants
to
feel
free
to
we
can
be
little
more
informal
among
friends
as
your
chancellor
mentioned
five
years
ago
had
the
privilege
to
address
this
city
as
senator
today
proud
to
return
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
bring
with
me
the
enduring
friendship
of
the
american
people
as
well
as
my
wife
and
and
you
may
notice
that
they
not
here
the
last
thing
they
want
to
do
is
to
listen
to
another
from
me
so
they
out
experiencing
the
beauty
and
the
history
of
berlin
and
this
history
speaks
to
us
today
here
for
thousands
of
years
the
people
of
this
land
have
journeyed
from
tribe
to
principality
to
through
reformation
and
enlightenment
renowned
as
of
poets
and
thinkers
among
them
who
taught
us
that
freedom
is
the
birthright
of
man
and
it
belongs
to
him
by
force
of
his
here
for
two
centuries
this
gate
stood
tall
as
the
world
around
it
convulsed
through
the
rise
and
fall
of
empires
through
revolutions
and
republics
art
and
music
and
science
that
reflected
the
height
of
human
but
also
war
and
carnage
that
exposed
the
depths
of
cruelty
to
man
it
was
here
that
carved
out
an
island
of
democracy
against
the
greatest
of
odds
as
has
already
been
mentioned
they
were
supported
by
an
airlift
of
hope
and
we
are
so
to
be
joined
by
colonel
years
old
the
original
we
could
not
be
prouder
of
him
hope
look
that
good
by
the
way
when
during
that
time
plan
seeded
miracle
and
north
atlantic
alliance
protected
our
people
and
those
in
the
and
nations
to
the
east
drew
strength
from
the
knowledge
that
freedom
was
possible
here
in
berlin
that
the
waves
of
crackdowns
and
might
therefore
someday
be
overcome
today
years
after
they
rose
up
against
oppression
we
remember
the
east
german
of
june
when
the
wall
finally
came
down
it
was
their
dreams
that
were
fulfilled
their
strength
and
their
passion
their
enduring
example
remind
us
that
for
all
the
power
of
for
all
the
authority
of
governments
it
is
citizens
who
choose
whether
to
be
defined
by
wall
or
whether
to
tear
it
down
and
now
surrounded
by
the
symbols
of
germany
reborn
rebuilt
and
its
glistening
glass
dome
an
american
embassy
back
at
its
historic
home
on
and
this
square
itself
once
desolate
no
land
is
now
open
to
all
so
while
am
not
the
first
american
president
to
come
to
this
gate
am
proud
to
stand
on
its
eastern
side
to
pay
tribute
to
the
past
for
throughout
all
this
history
the
fate
of
this
city
came
down
to
simple
question
will
we
live
free
or
in
chains
under
governments
that
uphold
our
universal
rights
or
regimes
that
suppress
them
in
open
societies
that
respect
the
sanctity
of
the
individual
and
our
free
will
or
in
closed
societies
that
suffocate
the
soul
as
free
peoples
we
stated
our
convictions
long
ago
as
americans
we
believe
that
men
are
created
with
the
right
to
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
as
germans
you
declared
in
your
basic
law
that
dignity
of
man
is
around
the
world
nations
have
pledged
themselves
to
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
which
the
inherent
dignity
and
rights
of
all
members
of
our
human
family
and
this
is
what
was
at
stake
here
in
berlin
all
those
years
and
because
courageous
crowds
climbed
atop
that
wall
because
corrupt
dictatorships
gave
way
to
new
democracies
because
millions
across
this
continent
now
breathe
the
fresh
air
of
freedom
we
can
say
here
in
berlin
here
in
europe
our
values
won
openness
won
tolerance
won
and
freedom
won
here
in
berlin
and
yet
more
than
two
decades
after
that
triumph
we
must
acknowledge
that
there
can
at
times
be
complacency
among
our
western
democracies
today
people
often
come
together
in
places
like
this
to
remember
history
not
to
make
it
after
all
we
face
no
concrete
walls
no
barbed
wire
there
are
no
tanks
poised
across
border
there
are
no
visits
to
fallout
shelters
and
so
sometimes
there
can
be
sense
that
the
great
challenges
have
somehow
passed
and
that
brings
with
it
temptation
to
turn
inward
to
think
of
our
own
pursuits
and
not
the
sweep
of
history
to
believe
that
settled
accounts
that
we
can
simply
enjoy
the
fruits
won
by
our
forebears
but
come
here
today
berlin
to
say
complacency
is
not
the
character
of
great
nations
threats
are
not
as
stark
as
they
were
half
century
ago
but
the
struggle
for
freedom
and
security
and
human
dignity
that
struggle
goes
on
and
come
here
to
this
city
of
hope
because
the
tests
of
our
time
demand
the
same
fighting
spirit
that
defined
berlin
ago
chancellor
mentioned
that
we
mark
the
anniversary
of
president
john
stirring
of
freedom
embodied
in
the
people
of
this
great
city
his
pledge
of
solidarity
bin
through
the
ages
but
not
all
that
he
said
that
day
less
remembered
is
the
challenge
that
he
issued
to
the
crowd
before
him
me
ask
you
he
said
to
those
me
ask
you
to
lift
your
eyes
beyond
the
dangers
of
and
the
freedom
of
merely
this
look
he
said
the
day
of
peace
with
justice
beyond
yourselves
and
ourselves
to
all
president
kennedy
was
taken
from
us
less
than
six
months
after
he
spoke
those
words
and
like
so
many
who
died
in
those
decades
of
division
he
did
not
live
to
see
berlin
united
and
free
instead
he
lives
forever
as
young
man
in
our
memory
but
his
words
are
timeless
because
they
call
upon
us
to
care
more
about
things
than
just
our
own
about
our
own
city
about
our
own
country
they
demand
that
we
embrace
the
common
of
all
humanity
and
if
we
lift
our
eyes
as
president
kennedy
called
us
to
do
then
that
our
work
is
not
yet
done
for
we
are
not
only
citizens
of
america
or
germany
we
are
also
citizens
of
the
world
and
our
fates
and
fortunes
are
linked
like
never
before
we
may
no
longer
live
in
fear
of
global
annihilation
but
so
long
as
nuclear
weapons
exist
we
are
not
truly
safe
we
may
strike
blows
against
terrorist
networks
but
if
we
ignore
the
instability
and
intolerance
that
fuels
extremism
our
own
freedom
will
eventually
be
endangered
we
may
enjoy
standard
of
living
that
is
the
envy
of
the
world
but
so
long
as
hundreds
of
millions
endure
the
agony
of
an
empty
stomach
or
the
anguish
of
unemployment
not
truly
prosperous
say
all
this
here
in
the
heart
of
europe
because
our
shared
past
shows
that
none
of
these
challenges
can
be
met
unless
we
see
ourselves
as
part
of
something
bigger
than
our
own
experience
our
alliance
is
the
foundation
of
global
security
our
trade
and
our
commerce
is
the
engine
of
our
global
economy
our
values
call
upon
us
to
care
about
the
lives
of
people
we
will
never
meet
when
europe
and
america
lead
with
our
hopes
instead
of
our
fears
we
do
things
that
no
other
nations
can
do
no
other
nations
will
do
so
we
have
to
lift
up
our
eyes
today
and
consider
the
day
of
peace
with
justice
that
our
generation
wants
for
this
world
suggest
that
peace
with
justice
begins
with
the
example
we
set
here
at
home
for
we
know
from
our
own
histories
that
intolerance
breeds
injustice
whether
it
based
on
race
or
religion
gender
or
sexual
orientation
we
are
stronger
when
all
our
people
no
matter
who
they
are
or
what
they
look
like
are
granted
opportunity
and
when
our
wives
and
our
daughters
have
the
same
opportunities
as
our
husbands
and
our
sons
when
we
respect
the
faiths
in
our
churches
and
synagogues
our
mosques
and
our
temples
we
more
secure
when
we
welcome
the
immigrant
with
his
talents
or
her
dreams
we
are
renewed
when
we
stand
up
for
our
gay
and
lesbian
brothers
and
sisters
and
treat
their
love
and
their
rights
equally
under
the
law
we
defend
our
own
liberty
as
well
we
are
more
free
when
all
people
can
pursue
their
own
happiness
and
as
long
as
walls
exist
in
our
hearts
to
separate
us
from
those
who
look
like
us
or
think
like
us
or
worship
as
we
do
then
we
going
to
have
to
work
harder
together
to
bring
those
walls
of
division
down
peace
with
justice
means
free
enterprise
that
unleashes
the
talents
and
creativity
that
reside
in
each
of
us
in
other
models
direct
economic
growth
from
the
top
down
or
relies
solely
on
the
resources
extracted
from
the
earth
but
we
believe
that
real
prosperity
comes
from
our
most
precious
resource
our
people
and
why
we
choose
to
invest
in
education
and
science
and
research
and
now
as
we
emerge
from
recession
we
must
not
avert
our
eyes
from
the
insult
of
widening
inequality
or
the
pain
of
youth
who
are
unemployed
we
have
to
build
new
ladders
of
opportunity
in
our
own
societies
that
even
as
we
pursue
new
trade
and
investment
that
fuels
growth
across
the
atlantic
america
will
stand
with
europe
as
you
strengthen
your
union
and
we
want
to
work
with
you
to
make
sure
that
every
person
can
enjoy
the
dignity
that
comes
from
work
whether
they
live
in
chicago
or
or
belfast
or
berlin
in
athens
or
madrid
everybody
deserves
opportunity
we
have
to
have
economies
that
are
working
for
all
people
not
just
those
at
the
very
top
peace
with
justice
means
extending
hand
to
those
who
reach
for
freedom
wherever
they
live
different
peoples
and
cultures
will
follow
their
own
path
but
we
must
reject
the
lie
that
those
who
live
in
distant
places
yearn
for
freedom
and
just
like
we
do
that
they
somehow
yearn
for
dignity
and
rule
of
law
just
like
we
do
we
can
not
dictate
the
pace
of
change
in
places
like
the
arab
world
but
we
must
reject
the
excuse
that
we
can
do
nothing
to
support
it
we
can
not
shrink
from
our
role
of
advancing
the
values
we
believe
in
whether
it
supporting
afghans
as
they
take
responsibility
for
their
future
or
working
for
an
peace
or
engaging
as
we
done
in
burma
to
help
create
space
for
brave
people
to
emerge
from
decades
of
dictatorship
in
this
century
these
are
the
citizens
who
long
to
join
the
free
world
they
are
who
you
were
they
deserve
our
support
for
they
too
in
their
own
way
are
citizens
of
berlin
and
we
have
to
help
them
every
day
peace
with
justice
means
pursuing
the
security
of
world
without
nuclear
weapons
no
matter
how
distant
that
dream
may
be
and
so
as
president
strengthened
our
efforts
to
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
reduced
the
number
and
role
of
nuclear
weapons
because
of
the
new
start
treaty
on
track
to
cut
american
and
russian
deployed
nuclear
warheads
to
their
lowest
levels
since
the
but
we
have
more
work
to
do
so
today
announcing
additional
steps
forward
after
comprehensive
review
determined
that
we
can
ensure
the
security
of
america
and
our
allies
and
maintain
strong
and
credible
strategic
deterrent
while
reducing
our
deployed
strategic
nuclear
weapons
by
up
to
and
intend
to
seek
negotiated
cuts
with
russia
to
move
beyond
cold
war
nuclear
postures
at
the
same
time
work
with
our
nato
allies
to
seek
bold
reductions
in
and
russian
tactical
weapons
in
europe
and
we
can
forge
new
international
framework
for
peaceful
nuclear
power
and
reject
the
nuclear
that
north
korea
and
iran
may
be
seeking
america
will
host
summit
in
to
continue
our
efforts
to
secure
nuclear
materials
around
the
world
and
we
will
work
to
build
support
in
the
united
states
to
ratify
the
comprehensive
nuclear
test
ban
treaty
and
call
on
all
nations
to
begin
negotiations
on
treaty
that
ends
the
production
of
fissile
materials
for
nuclear
weapons
these
are
steps
we
can
take
to
create
world
of
peace
with
justice
peace
with
justice
means
refusing
to
condemn
our
children
to
harsher
less
hospitable
planet
the
effort
to
slow
climate
change
requires
bold
action
and
on
this
germany
and
europe
have
led
in
the
united
states
we
have
recently
doubled
our
renewable
energy
from
clean
sources
like
wind
and
solar
power
doubling
fuel
efficiency
on
our
cars
our
dangerous
carbon
emissions
have
come
down
but
we
know
we
have
to
do
more
and
we
will
do
more
with
global
middle
class
consuming
more
energy
every
day
this
must
now
be
an
effort
of
all
nations
not
just
some
for
the
grim
alternative
affects
all
nations
more
severe
storms
more
famine
and
floods
new
waves
of
refugees
coastlines
that
vanish
oceans
that
rise
this
is
the
future
we
must
avert
this
is
the
global
threat
of
our
time
and
for
the
sake
of
future
generations
our
generation
must
move
toward
global
compact
to
confront
changing
climate
before
it
is
too
late
that
is
our
job
that
is
our
task
we
have
to
get
to
work
peace
with
justice
means
meeting
our
moral
obligations
and
we
have
moral
obligation
and
profound
interest
in
helping
lift
the
impoverished
corners
of
the
world
by
promoting
growth
so
we
spare
child
born
today
lifetime
of
extreme
poverty
by
investing
in
agriculture
so
we
just
sending
food
but
also
teaching
farmers
to
grow
food
by
strengthening
public
health
so
not
just
sending
medicine
but
training
doctors
and
nurses
who
will
help
end
the
outrage
of
children
dying
from
preventable
diseases
making
sure
that
we
do
everything
we
can
to
the
promise
an
achievable
promise
of
the
first
generation
that
is
something
that
is
possible
if
we
feel
sufficient
sense
of
urgency
our
efforts
have
to
be
about
more
than
just
charity
about
new
models
of
empowering
people
to
build
institutions
to
abandon
the
rot
of
corruption
to
create
ties
of
trade
not
just
aid
both
with
the
west
and
among
the
nations
seeking
to
rise
and
increase
their
capacity
because
when
they
succeed
we
will
be
more
successful
as
well
our
fates
are
linked
and
we
can
not
ignore
those
who
are
yearning
not
only
for
freedom
but
also
prosperity
and
finally
remember
that
peace
with
justice
depends
on
our
ability
to
sustain
both
the
security
of
our
societies
and
the
openness
that
defines
them
threats
to
freedom
merely
come
from
the
outside
they
can
emerge
from
within
from
our
own
fears
from
the
disengagement
of
our
citizens
for
over
decade
america
has
been
at
war
yet
much
has
now
changed
over
the
five
years
since
last
spoke
here
in
berlin
the
iraq
war
is
now
over
the
afghan
war
is
coming
to
an
end
bin
laden
is
no
more
our
efforts
against
are
evolving
and
given
these
changes
last
month
spoke
about
efforts
against
terrorism
and
drew
inspiration
from
one
of
our
founding
fathers
james
who
wrote
nation
could
preserve
its
freedom
in
the
midst
of
continual
james
is
right
which
is
why
even
as
we
remain
vigilant
about
the
threat
of
terrorism
we
must
move
beyond
mindset
of
perpetual
war
and
in
america
that
means
redoubling
our
efforts
to
close
the
prison
at
it
means
tightly
controlling
our
use
of
new
technologies
like
drones
it
means
balancing
the
pursuit
of
security
with
the
protection
of
privacy
and
confident
that
that
balance
can
be
struck
confident
of
that
and
confident
that
working
with
germany
we
can
keep
each
other
safe
while
at
the
same
time
maintaining
those
essential
values
for
which
we
fought
for
our
current
programs
are
bound
by
the
rule
of
law
and
they
focused
on
threats
to
our
security
not
the
communications
of
ordinary
persons
they
help
confront
real
dangers
and
they
keep
people
safe
here
in
the
united
states
and
here
in
europe
but
we
must
accept
the
challenge
that
all
of
us
in
democratic
governments
face
to
listen
to
the
voices
who
disagree
with
us
to
have
an
open
debate
about
how
we
use
our
powers
and
how
we
must
constrain
them
and
to
always
remember
that
government
exists
to
serve
the
power
of
the
individual
and
not
the
other
way
around
what
makes
us
who
we
are
and
what
makes
us
different
from
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
that
is
how
we
stay
true
to
our
better
history
while
reaching
for
the
day
of
peace
and
justice
that
is
to
come
these
are
the
beliefs
that
guide
us
the
values
that
inspire
us
the
principles
that
bind
us
together
as
free
peoples
who
still
believe
the
words
of
martin
luther
king
that
injustice
anywhere
is
threat
to
justice
everywhere
and
we
should
ask
should
anyone
ask
if
our
generation
has
the
courage
to
meet
these
tests
if
anybody
asks
if
president
kennedy
words
ring
true
today
let
them
come
to
berlin
for
here
they
will
find
the
people
who
emerged
from
the
ruins
of
war
to
reap
the
blessings
of
peace
from
the
pain
of
division
to
the
joy
of
reunification
and
here
they
will
recall
how
people
trapped
behind
wall
braved
bullets
and
jumped
barbed
wire
and
dashed
across
minefields
and
dug
through
tunnels
and
leapt
from
buildings
and
swam
across
the
spree
to
claim
their
most
basic
right
of
freedom
the
wall
belongs
to
history
but
we
have
history
to
make
as
well
and
the
that
came
before
us
now
call
to
us
to
live
up
to
those
highest
ideals
to
care
for
the
young
people
who
find
job
in
our
own
countries
and
the
girls
who
are
allowed
to
go
to
school
overseas
to
be
vigilant
in
safeguarding
our
own
freedoms
but
also
to
extend
hand
to
those
who
are
reaching
for
freedom
abroad
this
is
the
lesson
of
the
ages
this
is
the
spirit
of
berlin
and
the
greatest
tribute
that
we
can
pay
to
those
who
came
before
us
is
by
carrying
on
their
work
to
pursue
peace
and
justice
not
only
in
our
countries
but
for
all
mankind
dank
god

belfast
hello
northern
ireland

difficult
to
speak
after
better
than
me
but
on
behalf
of
both
of
us
thank
you
so
much
for
this
extraordinarily
warm
welcome
and
want
to
thank
for
introducing
my
wife
we
had
chance
to
speak
with
backstage
and
an
extraordinary
young
woman
who
know
is
going
to
do
even
greater
things
in
years
to
come
want
to
thank
two
men
who
hosted
at
the
white
house
on
many
day
for
their
warm
welcome
first
minister
peter
and
deputy
first
minister
martin
spend
the
whole
year
trying
to
unite
washington
around
things
and
they
come
to
visit
on
day
and
they
do
it
in
single
afternoon
want
to
thank
the
secretary
of
state
for
northern
ireland
to
all
the
ministers
in
the
audience
to
lord
mayor
and
want
to
thank
all
the
citizens
of
belfast
and
northern
ireland
for
your
hospitality
as
our
daughters
pointed
out
as
we
were
driving
in
cause
big
fuss
wherever
go
so
traffic
and
barricades
and
police
officers
and
all
big
production
lot
of
people
are
involved
and
very
very
grateful
for
accommodating
us
the
first
time
and
visited
this
island
was
about
two
years
ago
we
were
to
join
tens
of
thousands
on
college
green
in
dublin
we
to
the
little
village
of
where
as
it
turned
out
my
grandfather
was
born
and
actually
identified
this
individual
in
this
place
only
few
years
ago
when
was
first
running
for
office
in
chicago
know
this
but
wish
had
when
was
in
chicago
as
was
campaigning
look
at
my
last
name
and
say
an
from
the
homeland
running
on
the
south
side
so
he
must
be
irish
but
never
heard
the
name
but
it
pays
to
be
irish
in
chicago
so
while
we
were
in
had
chance
to
meet
my
eighth
cousin
henry
also
known
as
henry
the
eighth
we
knew
he
was
my
cousin
because
his
ears
flapped
out
just
like
mine
leafed
through
the
parish
logs
where
the
names
of
my
ancestors
are
recorded
even
watched
learn
how
to
pull
proper
pint
of
audience
member
whoop
president
cheering
for
that
so
it
was
magical
visit
but
the
only
problem
was
it
was
far
too
short
volcano
in
iceland
forced
us
to
leave
before
we
could
even
spend
the
night
so
been
eager
for
chance
to
return
to
the
emerald
isle
ever
since
and
this
time
we
brought
our
daughters
too
in
particular
we
wanted
to
come
here
to
northern
ireland
place
of
remarkable
beauty
and
extraordinary
history
part
of
an
island
with
which
tens
of
millions
of
americans
share
an
eternal
relationship
story
in
part
began
right
outside
the
doors
of
this
gleaming
hall
three
hundred
and
years
ago
ship
set
sail
from
the
river
for
the
bay
filled
with
men
and
women
who
dreamed
of
building
new
life
in
new
land
they
followed
by
hundreds
of
thousands
more
helped
america
write
those
early
chapters
they
helped
us
win
our
independence
they
helped
us
draft
our
constitution
soon
after
america
returned
to
belfast
opening
one
of
our
very
first
consulates
here
in
when
george
washington
was
still
president
today
names
familiar
to
many
of
you
are
etched
on
schools
and
and
solemn
memorials
of
war
across
the
united
states
names
like
and
and
so
many
of
the
qualities
that
we
americans
hold
dear
we
imported
from
this
land
perseverance
faith
an
unbending
belief
that
we
make
our
own
destiny
and
an
unshakable
dream
that
if
we
work
hard
and
we
live
responsibly
something
better
lies
just
around
the
bend
so
our
histories
are
bound
by
blood
and
belief
by
culture
and
by
commerce
and
our
futures
are
equally
inextricably
linked
and
why
come
to
belfast
today
to
talk
about
the
future
we
can
build
together
your
generation
young
generation
has
come
of
age
in
world
with
fewer
walls
been
educated
in
an
era
of
instant
information
been
tempered
by
some
very
difficult
times
around
the
globe
and
as
travel
what
seen
of
young
people
like
you
around
the
world
they
show
me
these
currents
have
conspired
to
make
you
generation
possessed
by
both
realism
but
also
an
optimistic
idealism
generation
keenly
aware
of
the
world
as
it
is
but
eager
to
forge
the
world
as
it
should
be
and
when
it
comes
to
the
future
we
share
that
fills
me
with
hope
young
people
fill
me
with
hope
here
in
northern
ireland
this
generation
has
known
even
more
rapid
change
than
many
young
people
have
seen
around
the
world
and
while
you
have
unique
challenges
of
your
own
you
also
have
unique
reasons
to
be
hopeful
for
you
are
the
first
generation
in
this
land
to
inherit
more
than
just
the
hardened
attitudes
and
the
bitter
prejudices
of
the
past
an
inheritor
of
just
and
peace
you
now
live
in
thoroughly
modern
northern
ireland
of
course
the
recessions
that
spread
through
nearly
every
country
in
recent
years
have
inflicted
hardship
here
too
and
there
are
communities
that
still
endure
real
pain
but
day
to
day
life
is
changing
throughout
the
north
there
was
time
people
have
imagined
northern
ireland
hosting
gathering
of
world
leaders
as
you
are
today
and
want
to
thank
chief
constable
matt
for
working
to
keep
everyone
safe
this
week
northern
ireland
is
hosting
the
world
police
and
fire
games
later
this
year
which
dame
mary
peters
is
helping
to
golf
fans
like
me
had
to
wait
long
six
decades
for
the
irish
open
to
return
to
the
north
last
year
am
unhappy
that
will
not
get
few
rounds
in
while
here
did
meet
last
year
and
offered
to
get
my
swing
which
was
polite
way
of
saying
president
you
need
none
of
that
would
have
been
imaginable
generation
ago
and
belfast
is
different
city
factories
are
rebuilt
former
industrial
sites
are
reborn
visitors
come
from
all
over
to
see
an
exhibit
at
the
mac
play
at
the
lyric
concert
here
at
waterfront
hall
families
crowd
into
pubs
in
the
cathedral
quarter
to
hear
students
lounge
at
asking
each
other
the
so
to
paraphrase
the
manifestation
of
sheer
bloody
genius
this
island
is
now
chic
and
these
daily
moments
of
life
in
bustling
city
and
changing
country
it
may
seem
ordinary
to
many
of
you
and
what
makes
it
so
extraordinary
what
your
parents
and
grandparents
dreamt
for
all
of
you
to
travel
without
the
burden
of
checkpoints
or
roadblocks
or
seeing
soldiers
on
patrol
to
enjoy
sunny
day
free
from
the
awareness
that
violence
could
blacken
it
at
any
moment
to
befriend
or
fall
in
love
with
whomever
you
want
they
hoped
for
day
when
the
world
would
think
something
different
when
they
heard
the
word
because
of
their
effort
because
of
their
courage
that
day
has
come
because
of
their
work
those
dreams
they
had
for
you
became
the
most
incredible
thing
of
all
they
became
reality
it
been
years
now
since
the
good
friday
agreement
since
clenched
fists
gave
way
to
outstretched
hands
the
people
of
this
island
voted
in
overwhelming
numbers
to
see
beyond
the
scars
of
violence
and
mistrust
and
to
choose
to
wage
peace
over
the
years
other
breakthroughs
and
agreements
have
followed
extraordinary
because
for
years
few
conflicts
in
the
world
seemed
more
intractable
than
the
one
here
in
northern
ireland
and
when
peace
was
achieved
here
it
gave
the
entire
world
hope
the
world
rejoiced
in
your
achievement
especially
in
america
pubs
from
chicago
to
boston
were
scenes
of
revelry
folks
celebrating
the
hard
work
of
and
and
and
and
so
many
others
in
america
you
helped
us
transcend
our
differences
because
if
one
thing
on
which
democrats
and
republicans
in
america
wholeheartedly
agree
that
we
strongly
support
peaceful
and
prosperous
northern
ireland
but
as
all
of
you
know
all
too
well
for
all
the
strides
that
made
still
much
work
to
do
there
are
still
people
who
reaped
the
rewards
of
peace
there
are
those
who
convinced
that
the
effort
is
worth
it
there
are
still
wounds
that
healed
and
communities
where
tensions
and
mistrust
hangs
in
the
air
there
are
walls
that
still
stand
there
are
still
many
miles
to
go
from
the
start
no
one
was
enough
to
believe
that
peace
would
be
anything
but
long
journey
once
wrote
comes
dropping
but
that
mean
our
efforts
to
forge
real
and
lasting
peace
should
come
dropping
slow
this
work
is
as
urgent
now
as
it
has
ever
been
because
more
to
lose
now
than
there
has
ever
been
in
world
what
happens
here
has
an
impact
on
lives
far
from
these
green
shores
if
you
continue
your
courageous
path
toward
permanent
peace
and
all
the
social
and
economic
benefits
that
have
come
with
it
that
just
be
good
for
you
it
will
be
good
for
this
entire
island
it
will
be
good
for
the
united
kingdom
it
will
be
good
for
europe
it
will
be
good
for
the
world
we
need
you
to
get
this
right
and
more
you
set
an
example
for
those
who
seek
peace
of
their
own
because
beyond
these
shores
right
now
in
scattered
corners
of
the
world
there
are
people
living
in
the
grip
of
conflict
ethnic
conflict
religious
conflict
tribal
conflicts
and
they
know
something
better
is
out
there
and
groping
to
find
way
to
discover
how
to
move
beyond
the
heavy
hand
of
history
to
put
aside
the
violence
studying
what
doing
and
wondering
perhaps
if
northern
ireland
can
achieve
peace
we
can
too
their
blueprint
to
follow
their
proof
of
what
is
possible
because
hope
is
contagious
watching
to
see
what
you
do
next
now
some
of
that
is
up
to
your
leaders
as
someone
who
knows
firsthand
how
politics
can
encourage
division
and
discourage
cooperation
admire
the
northern
ireland
executive
and
the
northern
ireland
assembly
all
the
more
for
making
work
not
easy
to
do
it
requires
compromise
and
it
requires
absorbing
some
pain
from
your
own
side
applaud
them
for
taking
responsibility
for
law
enforcement
and
for
justice
and
commend
their
effort
to
united
important
next
steps
along
your
transformational
journey
because
issues
like
segregated
schools
and
housing
lack
of
jobs
and
opportunity
symbols
of
history
that
are
source
of
pride
for
some
and
pain
for
others
these
are
not
tangential
to
peace
essential
to
it
if
towns
remain
divided
if
have
their
schools
and
buildings
and
protestants
have
theirs
if
we
see
ourselves
in
one
another
if
fear
or
resentment
are
allowed
to
harden
that
encourages
division
it
discourages
cooperation
ultimately
peace
is
just
not
about
politics
about
attitudes
about
sense
of
empathy
about
breaking
down
the
divisions
that
we
create
for
ourselves
in
our
own
minds
and
our
own
hearts
that
exist
in
any
objective
reality
but
that
we
carry
with
us
generation
after
generation
and
know
because
america
we
too
have
had
to
work
hard
over
the
decades
slowly
gradually
sometimes
painfully
in
fits
and
starts
to
keep
perfecting
our
union
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
we
were
torn
open
by
terrible
conflict
our
civil
war
was
far
shorter
than
the
troubles
but
it
killed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
our
people
and
of
course
the
legacy
of
slavery
endured
for
generations
even
century
after
we
achieved
our
own
peace
we
were
not
fully
united
when
was
boy
many
cities
still
had
separate
drinking
fountains
and
lunch
counters
and
for
blacks
and
whites
my
own
marriage
would
have
been
illegal
in
certain
states
and
someone
who
looked
like
me
often
had
hard
time
casting
ballot
much
less
being
on
ballot
but
over
time
laws
changed
and
hearts
and
minds
changed
sometimes
driven
by
courageous
lawmakers
but
more
often
driven
by
committed
citizens
politicians
follow
rather
than
lead
and
so
especially
young
people
helped
to
push
and
to
prod
and
to
protest
and
to
make
common
cause
with
those
who
did
not
look
like
them
and
that
transformed
america
so
that
and
generation
they
have
different
attitudes
about
differences
and
race
than
mine
and
certainly
different
from
the
generation
before
that
and
each
successive
generation
creates
new
space
for
peace
and
tolerance
and
justice
and
fairness
and
while
we
have
work
to
do
in
many
ways
we
have
surely
become
more
tolerant
and
more
just
more
accepting
more
willing
to
see
our
diversity
in
america
not
as
something
to
fear
but
as
something
to
welcome
because
it
source
of
our
national
strength
so
as
your
leaders
step
forward
to
address
your
challenges
through
talks
by
all
parties
need
you
young
people
to
keep
pushing
them
to
create
space
for
them
to
change
attitudes
because
ultimately
whether
your
communities
deal
with
the
past
and
face
the
future
united
together
something
you
have
to
wait
for
somebody
else
to
do
choice
you
have
to
make
right
now
it
within
your
power
to
bring
about
change
whether
you
are
good
to
someone
from
the
other
side
of
past
battles
up
to
you
whether
you
treat
them
with
the
dignity
and
respect
they
deserve
up
to
you
whether
you
let
your
kids
play
with
kids
who
attend
different
church
your
decision
whether
you
take
stand
against
violence
and
hatred
and
tell
extremists
on
both
sides
that
no
matter
how
many
times
they
attack
the
peace
they
will
not
succeed
that
is
in
your
hands
and
whether
you
reach
your
own
outstretched
hand
across
dividing
lines
across
peace
walls
to
build
trust
in
spirit
of
respect
up
to
you
the
terms
of
peace
may
be
negotiated
by
political
leaders
but
the
fate
of
peace
is
up
to
each
of
us
this
peace
in
northern
ireland
has
been
tested
over
the
past
years
it
been
tested
over
the
past
year
it
will
be
tested
again
but
remember
something
that
president
said
when
he
spoke
here
in
belfast
just
few
weeks
after
the
horrors
of
that
bomb
he
said
not
the
last
bomb
of
the
troubles
it
was
the
opening
shot
of
vicious
attack
on
the
and
whenever
your
peace
is
attacked
you
will
have
to
choose
whether
to
respond
with
the
same
bravery
that
summoned
so
far
or
whether
you
succumb
to
the
worst
instincts
those
impulses
that
kept
this
great
land
divided
for
too
long
you
have
to
choose
whether
to
keep
going
forward
not
backwards
and
you
should
know
that

you

you
do

will
keep
working
closely
with
leaders
in
dublin
and
to
support
your
political
progress

strengthen

through
efforts
like
the
broad
economic
initiative
announced
on
friday
to
unlock
new
opportunities
for
growth
and
investment
between
our
two
businesses
because
jobs

collaborating

in
fields
like
nanotechnology
and
clean
energy
and
health
care
that
make
our
lives
better
and
fuel
economic
growth
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
because
progress
is
essential
to
peace
and
because
knowledge
and
understanding
is
essential
to
peace
we
will
keep
investing
in
programs
that
enrich
both
of
us
programs
like
the
one
at
belfast
metropolitan
college
which
teaches
students
from
west
and
north
belfast
the
skills
they
need
for
new
jobs
and
exchange
programs
that
have
given
thousands
in
northern
ireland
and
the
united
states
the
chance
to
travel
to
each
communities
and
learn
from
one
another
now
one
of
those
young
people
is
here
today
is
the
director
of
an
called
groundwork
northern
ireland
which
aims
to
bring
about
change
from
the
ground
up
is
here
somewhere
where
is
she
here
somewhere
here
too
yes
some
guy
just
waved
he
said
which
is
good
appreciate
you
being
here
as
someone
who
got
my
start
as
community
was
so
impressed
with
what
has
done
because
few
years
ago
visited
the
united
states
to
learn
more
about
how
americans
to
improve
their
communities
so
after
she
came
home
rolled
up
her
sleeves
here
in
belfast
and
decided
to
do
something
about
park
some
of
you
may
know
this
park
for
years
it
was
thought
to
be
the
only
park
in
europe
still
divided
by
wall
think
about
that
in
all
of
europe
that
one
park
has
got
wall
in
the
middle
of
it
and
her
colleagues
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
to
do
anything
about
peace
wall
but
they
reached
out
to
the
police
they
reached
out
to
the
department
of
justice
they
brought
together
people
from
across
the
communities
they
knew
it
was
going
to
be
hard
but
they
tried
anyway
and
together
they
all
decided
to
build
gate
to
open
that
wall
and
now
people
can
walk
freely
through
the
park
and
enjoy
the
sun
when
it
comes
out
just
like
people
do
every
day
in
parks
all
around
the
world
small
bit
of
progress
but
the
fact
that
so
far
only
got
gate
open
and
the
wall
is
still
up
means
more
work
to
do
and
the
work
of
your
generation
as
long
as
more
walls
still
stand
we
will
need
more
people
like
need
more
of
you
young
people
who
imagine
the
world
as
it
should
be
who
knock
down
walls
who
knock
down
barriers
who
imagine
something
different
and
have
the
courage
to
make
it
happen
the
courage
to
bring
communities
together
to
make
even
the
small
impossibilities
shining
example
of
what
is
possible
and
that
more
than
anything
will
shape
what
northern
ireland
looks
like
years
from
now
and
beyond
all
of
you
every
single
young
person
here
today
possess
something
the
generation
before
yours
did
not
and
that
is
an
example
to
follow
when
those
who
took
chance
on
peace
got
started
they
have
successful
model
to
emulate
they
know
how
it
would
work
but
they
took
chance
and
so
far
it
has
succeeded
and
the
first
steps
are
the
hardest
and
requires
the
most
courage
the
rest
now
is
up
to
you
is
indeed
harder
than
war
the
irish
author
recently
wrote
its
constant
fragility
is
part
of
its
beauty
bullet
need
happen
only
once
but
for
peace
to
work
we
need
to
be
reminded
of
its
existence
again
and
again
and
and
what
we
need
from
you
what
we
need
from
every
young
person
in
northern
ireland
and
what
we
need
from
every
young
person
around
the
world
you
must
remind
us
of
the
existence
of
peace
the
possibility
of
peace
you
have
to
remind
us
of
hope
again
and
again
and
again
despite
resistance
despite
setbacks
despite
hardship
despite
tragedy
you
have
to
remind
us
of
the
future
again
and
again
and
again
have
confidence
you
will
choose
that
path
you
will
embrace
that
task
and
to
those
who
choose
the
path
of
peace
promise
you
the
united
states
of
america
will
support
you
every
step
of
the
way
we
will
always
be
wind
at
your
back
and
as
said
when
visited
two
years
ago
am
convinced
that
this
little
island
that
inspires
the
biggest
of
things
this
little
island
its
best
days
are
yet
ahead
good
luck
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
all
the
people
of
northern
ireland
thank
you
well
good
morning
everybody
welcome
to
the
white
house
it
is
pleasure
to
have
so
many
distinguished
americans
today
from
so
many
different
walks
of
life
got
democrats
and
republicans
we
got
and
business
leaders
up
on
stage
we
have
law
enforcement
and
clergy
americans
who
see
on
every
issue
in
fact
in
some
cases
do
see
on
just
about
any
issue
but
who
are
today
standing
united
in
support
of
the
legislation
that
is
front
and
in
congress
this
week
bipartisan
bill
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
and
have
to
say
please
give
another
round
of
applause
it
takes
lot
of
courage
to
do
what
did
to
step
out
of
the
shadows
to
share
her
story
and
to
hope
that
despite
the
risks
she
could
make
difference
but
think
is
representative
of
so
many
dreamers
out
there
who
have
worked
so
hard
and
had
chance
to
meet
so
many
of
them
been
willing
to
give
face
to
the
undocumented
and
have
inspired
movement
across
america
and
with
each
step
reminded
us
time
and
again
what
this
debate
is
all
about
this
is
not
an
abstract
debate
this
is
about
incredible
young
people
who
understand
themselves
to
be
americans
who
have
done
everything
right
but
have
still
been
hampered
in
achieving
their
american
dream
and
they
remind
us
that
we
nation
of
immigrants
throughout
our
history
the
promise
we
found
in
those
who
come
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
has
always
been
one
of
our
greatest
strengths
kept
our
workforce
vibrant
and
dynamic
kept
our
businesses
on
the
cutting
edge
helped
build
the
greatest
economic
engine
that
the
world
has
ever
known
when
speak
to
other
world
leaders
one
of
the
biggest
advantages
we
have
economically
is
our
demographics
we
constantly
replenishing
ourselves
with
talent
from
across
the
globe
no
other
country
can
match
that
history
and
what
was
true
years
ago
is
still
true
today
beeping
over
there
feeling
kind
of
you
okay
in
recent
years
one
in
four
of
new
small
business
owners
were
immigrants
one
in
four
startups
in
america
were
founded
by
immigrants
forty
percent
of
fortune
companies
were
started
by
or
american
think
about
that
almost
half
of
the
fortune
companies
when
they
were
started
were
started
by
or
immigrants
so
immigration
just
part
of
our
national
character
it
is
driving
force
in
our
economy
that
creates
jobs
and
prosperity
for
all
of
our
citizens
now
the
thing
over
the
past
two
decades
our
immigration
system
kept
pace
with
changing
times
and
matched
up
with
our
most
cherished
values
right
now
our
immigration
system
invites
the
best
and
the
brightest
from
all
over
the
world
to
come
and
study
at
our
top
universities
and
then
once
they
finish
once
gotten
the
training
they
need
to
build
new
invention
or
create
new
business
our
system
too
often
tells
them
to
go
back
home
so
that
other
countries
can
reap
the
benefits
the
new
jobs
the
new
businesses
the
new
industries
not
smart
but
the
broken
system
we
have
today
right
now
our
immigration
system
keeps
families
apart
for
years
at
time
even
for
folks
who
technically
under
the
legal
immigration
system
should
be
eligible
to
become
citizens
but
it
is
so
long
and
so
cumbersome
so
that
families
end
up
being
separated
for
years
because
of
backlog
in
visas
people
who
come
here
legally
who
are
ready
to
give
it
their
all
to
earn
their
place
in
america
end
up
waiting
for
years
to
join
their
loved
ones
here
in
the
united
states
not
right
but
the
broken
system
we
have
today
right
now
our
immigration
system
has
no
credible
way
of
dealing
with
the
million
men
and
women
who
are
in
this
country
illegally
and
yes
they
broke
the
rules
they
wait
their
turn
they
be
let
off
easy
they
be
allowed
to
game
the
system
but
at
the
same
time
the
vast
majority
of
these
individuals
looking
for
any
trouble
just
looking
to
provide
for
their
families
contribute
to
their
communities
our
we
know
their
kids
too
often
forced
to
do
what
they
do
in
shadow
economy
where
shady
employers
can
exploit
them
by
paying
less
than
the
minimum
wage
making
them
work
without
overtime
not
giving
them
any
benefits
that
pushes
down
standards
for
all
workers
bad
for
everybody
because
all
the
businesses
that
do
play
by
the
rules
that
hire
people
legally
that
pay
them
fairly
at
competitive
disadvantage
american
workers
end
up
being
at
competitive
disadvantage
not
fair
but
the
broken
system
that
we
have
today
now
over
the
past
four
years
tried
to
patch
up
some
of
the
worst
cracks
in
the
system
we
made
border
security
top
priority
today
we
have
twice
as
many
border
patrol
agents
as
we
did
in
we
have
more
boots
on
the
ground
along
our
southern
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
and
in
part
by
using
technology
more
effectively
illegal
crossings
are
near
their
lowest
level
in
decades
we
focused
our
enforcement
efforts
on
criminals
who
are
here
illegally
and
who
are
endangering
our
communities
and
today
deportation
of
criminals
is
at
its
highest
level
ever
and
having
put
border
security
in
place
having
refocused
on
those
who
could
do
our
communities
harm
we
also
then
took
up
the
cause
of
the
dreamers
young
people
like
who
were
brought
to
this
country
as
children
we
said
that
if
able
to
meet
some
basic
criteria
like
pursuing
higher
education
then
consider
offering
you
the
chance
to
come
out
of
the
shadows
so
you
can
continue
to
work
here
and
study
here
and
contribute
to
our
communities
legally
so
my
administration
has
done
what
we
can
on
our
own
and
got
members
of
my
administration
here
done
outstanding
work
over
the
past
few
years
to
try
to
close
up
some
of
the
gaps
that
exist
in
the
system
but
the
system
is
still
broken
and
to
truly
deal
with
this
issue
congress
needs
to
act
and
that
moment
is
now
this
week
the
senate
will
consider
bipartisan
bill
that
is
the
best
chance
had
in
years
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
it
will
build
on
what
done
and
continue
to
strengthen
our
borders
it
will
make
sure
that
businesses
and
workers
are
all
playing
by
the
same
set
of
rules
and
it
includes
tough
penalties
for
those
who
fair
for
families
by
making
sure
that
those
who
are
brought
into
the
system
pay
their
fair
share
in
taxes
and
for
services
and
fair
for
those
who
try
to
immigrate
legally
by
stopping
those
who
try
to
skip
the
line
the
right
thing
to
do
now
this
bill
perfect
compromise
and
going
forward
nobody
is
going
to
get
everything
that
they
want
not
democrats
not
republicans
not
me
but
this
is
bill
largely
consistent
with
the
principles
that
and
the
people
on
this
stage
have
laid
out
for
reform
first
of
all
if
passed
this
bill
would
be
the
biggest
commitment
to
border
security
in
our
history
it
would
put
another
billion
on
top
of
what
already
spending
towards
stronger
smarter
security
along
our
borders
it
would
increase
criminal
penalties
against
smugglers
and
traffickers
it
would
finally
give
every
employer
reliable
way
to
check
that
every
person
hiring
is
here
legally
and
it
would
hold
employers
more
accountable
if
they
knowingly
hire
undocumented
workers
so
it
strengthens
border
security
but
also
enforcement
within
our
borders
know
lot
of
talk
right
now
about
border
security
so
let
me
repeat
today
illegal
crossings
are
near
their
lowest
level
in
decades
and
if
passed
the
senate
bill
as
currently
written
and
as
hitting
the
floor
would
put
in
place
the
toughest
border
enforcement
plan
that
america
has
ever
seen
so
nobody
is
taking
border
enforcement
lightly
part
of
this
bill
number
two
this
bill
would
provide
pathway
to
earned
citizenship
for
the
million
individuals
who
are
in
this
country
illegally
so
that
pathway
is
arduous
you
got
to
pass
background
checks
you
got
to
learn
english
you
got
to
pay
taxes
and
penalty
and
then
you
got
to
go
to
the
back
of
the
line
behind
everybody
done
things
the
right
way
and
have
tried
to
come
here
legally
so
this
be
quick
process
it
will
take
at
least
years
before
the
vast
majority
of
these
individuals
are
able
to
even
apply
for
citizenship
so
this
is
no
but
the
only
way
we
can
make
sure
that
everyone
here
is
playing
by
the
same
rules
as
ordinary
families
paying
taxes
and
getting
their
own
health
insurance
why
for
immigration
reform
to
work
it
must
be
clear
from
the
outset
that
there
is
pathway
to
citizenship
if
asking
everybody
to
play
by
the
same
rules
you
got
to
give
people
sense
of
certainty
that
they
go
through
all
these
sacrifices
do
all
this
that
at
the
end
of
the
horizon
the
opportunity
not
the
guarantee
but
the
opportunity
to
be
part
of
this
american
family
and
by
the
way
majority
of
americans
support
this
idea
number
three
this
bill
would
the
legal
immigration
system
so
that
alongside
training
american
workers
for
the
jobs
of
tomorrow
also
attracting
the
highly
skilled
entrepreneurs
and
engineers
from
around
the
world
who
will
ultimately
grow
our
economy
and
this
bill
would
help
make
sure
that
our
people
have
to
wait
years
before
their
loved
ones
are
able
to
join
them
here
in
america
so
what
immigration
reform
looks
like
smarter
enforcement
pathway
to
earned
citizenship
improvements
to
our
legal
system
all
steps
got
bipartisan
support
got
the
support
of
broad
of
leaders
from
every
walk
of
life
so
no
reason
congress
get
this
done
by
the
end
of
the
summer
remember
the
process
that
led
to
this
bill
was
open
and
inclusive
for
months
the
bipartisan
gang
of
eight
looked
at
every
issue
reconciled
competing
ideas
built
compromise
that
works
then
the
judiciary
committee
held
numerous
hearings
more
than
hundred
amendments
were
added
often
with
bipartisan
support
the
good
news
is
every
day
that
goes
by
more
and
more
republicans
and
democrats
are
coming
out
to
support
this
immigration
reform
bill
and
sure
the
bill
will
go
through
few
more
changes
in
the
weeks
to
come
but
this
much
is
clear
if
you
genuinely
believe
we
need
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
no
good
reason
to
stand
in
the
way
of
this
bill
lot
of
people
democrats
and
republicans
have
done
lot
of
good
work
on
this
bill
so
if
serious
about
actually
fixing
the
system
then
this
is
the
vehicle
to
do
it
if
not
serious
about
it
if
you
think
that
broken
system
is
the
best
america
can
do
then
guess
it
might
make
sense
to
try
to
block
it
but
if
you
actually
serious
and
sincere
about
fixing
broken
system
this
is
the
vehicle
to
do
it
and
now
is
the
time
to
get
it
done
there
is
no
good
reason
to
play
procedural
games
or
engage
in
obstruction
just
to
block
the
best
chance
had
in
years
to
address
this
problem
in
way
fair
to
families
to
business
owners
to
legal
immigrants
and
no
good
reason
to
undo
the
progress
already
made
especially
when
it
comes
to
extreme
steps
like
stripping
protections
from
dreamers
that
my
administration
has
provided
or
asking
law
enforcement
to
treat
them
the
same
way
they
treat
violent
criminals
not
who
we
are
we
owe
it
to
america
to
do
better
we
owe
it
to
the
dreamers
to
do
better
we
owe
it
to
the
young
people
like
and
with
us
here
today
where
right
here
came
here
from
with
his
parents
when
he
was
just
kid
and
growing
up
america
was
his
home
this
is
where
he
went
to
school
this
is
where
he
made
friends
this
is
where
he
built
life
you
ask
and
tell
you
he
feels
american
in
every
way
except
one
on
paper
in
high
school
found
out
that
he
was
undocumented
think
about
that
with
all
the
stuff
you
already
dealing
with
in
high
school
and
suddenly
oh
man
really
so
he
had
done
everything
right
stayed
out
of
trouble
excelled
in
class
contributed
to
his
community
feeling
hopeful
about
his
future
and
suddenly
he
finds
out
he
got
to
live
in
fear
of
deportation
watching
his
friends
get
their
licenses
knowing
he
get
one
himself
seeing
his
classmates
apply
for
summer
jobs
knowing
he
do
that
either
when
heard
that
we
were
going
to
offer
chance
for
folks
like
him
to
emerge
from
the
shadows
he
went
and
signed
up
all
he
wanted
he
said
was
chance
to
normal
and
to
to
the
country
and
this
year
was
approved
for
deferred
action
few
weeks
ago
he
graduated
from
thomas
university
where
he
was
student
body
president
and
of
the
so
now
set
his
sights
higher
master
degree
and
then
law
school
so
he
can
pursue
career
in
public
policy
help
america
shape
its
future
why
we
want
to
do
the
right
thing
by
what
rationale
is
there
out
there
that
want
to
make
sure
achieves
his
dreams
because
if
he
does
that
helps
us
all
achieve
our
dreams
so
in
the
weeks
to
come
you
hear
some
opponents
of
immigration
reform
try
to
gin
up
fear
and
create
division
and
spread
the
same
old
and
untruths
that
heard
before
and
when
that
happens
want
you
to
think
about
want
you
to
think
about
and
want
you
to
think
about
your
own
parents
and
your
own
grandparents
and
your
own
great
grandparents
and
all
the
men
and
women
and
children
who
came
here
the
notion
that
somehow
those
who
came
through
island
had
all
their
papers
right
had
checked
every
box
and
followed
procedures
as
they
were
getting
on
that
boat
they
were
looking
for
better
life
just
like
these
families
and
they
want
to
earn
their
way
into
the
american
story
and
if
willing
to
stand
with
them
and
if
willing
to
stand
with
all
these
outstanding
leaders
up
here
then
now
is
the
time
to
make
your
voice
heard
you
need
to
call
and
email
and
tweet
your
senators
and
tell
them
do
kick
this
problem
down
the
road
come
together
work
together
do
your
job
not
only
to
fix
broken
immigration
system
once
and
for
all
but
to
leave
something
better
for
all
the
generations
to
come
to
make
sure
we
continue
to
be
nation
of
laws
and
nation
of
immigrants
do
the
right
thing
thanks
god
bless
you
god
bless
america
good
morning
everybody
it
it
is
wonderful
to
see
all
of
you
and
want
to
thank
everybody
who
is
here
think
there
only
one
problem
and
that
is
that
my
remarks
are
not
sitting
here
people
things
by
friday
afternoon
things
get
little
challenged
question
will
you
answer
question
in
the
president
going
to
have
going
to
answer
question
at
the
end
of
the
remarks
but
want
to
make
sure
that
we
get
the
remarks
out
people
oh
goodness
oh
somebody
is
tripping
folks
are
sweating
back
there
right
now
well
good
morning
everybody
this
afternoon
going
to
be
in
southern
california
to
meet
with
president
of
china
but
before
leave
northern
california
wanted
to
take
minute
to
address
something
happening
with
the
affordable
care
act
in
this
state
and
wanted
to
meet
with
group
of
people
who
are
doing
some
very
important
work
on
behalf
of
families
these
leaders
from
government
the
california
endowment
and
major
spanish
language
media
outlets
have
joined
together
to
help
implement
the
affordable
care
act
here
in
california
and
to
educate
folks
about
how
to
sign
up
and
shop
for
quality
affordable
plans
and
their
efforts
have
already
shown
some
excellent
results
in
the
biggest
insurance
market
in
the
country
there
are
two
main
things
that
americans
need
to
know
when
it
comes
to
the
affordable
care
act
and
what
it
means
for
you
first
of
all
if
one
of
the
nearly
percent
of
americans
who
already
have
insurance
either
through
or
or
your
employer
you
have
to
do
thing
just
got
wide
array
of
new
benefits
better
protections
and
stronger
cost
controls
that
you
have
before
and
that
will
over
time
improve
the
quality
of
the
insurance
that
you
got
benefits
like
free
preventive
care
checkups
shots
and
contraception
you
are
now
going
to
be
able
to
get
those
things
through
your
insurance
where
they
previously
were
not
have
to
be
provided
protections
like
allowing
people
up
to
the
age
of
to
stay
on
their
parent
health
care
plans
which
has
already
helped
million
americans
including
million
young
latino
americans
cost
controls
like
requiring
insurance
companies
to
spend
at
least
percent
of
the
money
that
you
pay
in
premiums
in
your
actual
health
care
costs
as
opposed
to
administrative
costs
or
pay
not
overhead
but
that
money
has
to
be
spent
on
you
and
if
they
meet
that
target
they
actually
have
to
reimburse
you
so
in
california
already
getting
reports
that
insurers
are
giving
rebates
to
consumers
and
small
business
owners
to
the
tune
of
million
this
year
so
already
we
seeing
millions
of
dollars
of
rebates
sent
back
to
consumers
by
insurance
companies
as
consequence
of
this
law
all
of
that
is
happening
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
all
of
this
is
in
place
right
now
already
for
percent
of
americans
who
have
health
insurance
by
the
way
all
of
this
is
what
the
republican
party
has
now
voted
times
to
repeal
at
least
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
my
suggestion
to
them
has
been
let
stop
the
old
battles
and
start
working
with
people
like
the
leaders
who
are
on
stage
here
today
to
make
this
law
work
the
way
supposed
to
focused
on
moving
forward
and
making
sure
that
this
law
works
for
families
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
thing
that
people
need
to
know
about
the
affordable
care
act
if
one
of
nearly
million
or
tens
of
millions
of
americans
who
currently
have
health
insurance
soon
be
able
to
buy
quality
affordable
care
just
like
everybody
else
and
how
states
like
california
are
setting
up
new
where
beginning
on
october
of
this
year
you
can
comparison
shop
an
array
of
private
health
insurance
plans
just
like
you
were
going
to
compare
cars
or
airline
tickets
and
that
means
insurance
companies
will
actually
have
to
compete
with
each
other
for
your
business
and
that
means
new
choices
see
right
now
most
states
have
lot
of
competition
in
nearly
every
state
more
than
half
of
all
consumers
are
covered
by
only
two
insurers
so
no
incentive
to
provide
you
lot
of
choices
or
to
keep
costs
down
the
affordable
care
act
changes
that
beginning
next
year
once
these
are
open
most
states
will
offer
new
private
insurance
choices
that
exist
today
and
based
on
early
reports
about
in
americans
expected
to
enroll
in
these
live
in
states
where
be
able
to
choose
between
five
or
more
different
insurers
so
for
example
here
in
california
insurers
applied
to
join
the
marketplace
covered
california
then
selected
based
on
access
quality
and
affordability
four
of
which
are
brand
new
to
your
individual
market
so
happening
is
through
the
affordable
care
act
creating
these
with
more
competition
more
choice
and
so
the
question
is
what
happens
to
cost
now
lot
of
the
opponents
of
the
affordable
care
act
they
had
all
kinds
of
predictions
that
not
only
would
the
law
fail
but
what
also
is
costs
would
for
everybody
well
it
turns
out
actually
seeing
that
in
the
states
that
have
committed
themselves
to
implementing
this
law
correctly
seeing
some
good
news
competition
and
choice
are
pushing
down
costs
in
the
individual
market
just
like
the
law
was
designed
to
do
the
insurance
companies
that
were
chosen
by
covered
california
have
unveiled
premiums
that
were
lower
than
anybody
expected
and
those
who
afford
to
buy
private
insurance
will
get
help
reducing
their
premiums
even
further
with
the
largest
health
care
tax
cut
for
working
families
and
small
businesses
in
our
history
so
about
million
nearly
half
of
whom
are
will
qualify
for
tax
credits
that
will
in
some
cases
lower
their
premiums
significant
amount
now
none
of
this
is
surprise
this
is
the
way
that
the
law
was
designed
to
work
but
since
everybody
has
been
saying
how
it
not
going
to
happen
think
it
important
for
us
to
and
acknowledge
this
is
working
the
way
it
supposed
to
we
seen
similar
good
news
by
the
way
not
just
here
in
california
but
in
and
washington
in
states
that
are
working
hard
to
implement
this
law
properly
we
seeing
it
work
for
people
for
families
for
consumers
now
that
not
to
say
that
everything
is
going
to
go
perfectly
right
away
when
you
implementing
program
this
large
there
will
be
some
there
are
going
to
be
some
hiccups
but
no
matter
what
every
single
consumer
will
be
covered
by
the
new
benefits
and
protections
under
this
law
permanently
so
the
bottom
line
is
you
can
listen
to
bunch
of
political
talk
out
there
negative
and
fear
geared
towards
the
next
election
or
alternatively
you
can
actually
look
at
happening
in
states
like
california
right
now
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
through
these
exchanges
not
only
are
the
percent
of
people
who
already
have
health
insurance
getting
better
protections
and
receiving
rebates
and
being
able
to
keep
their
kids
on
their
health
insurance
until
they
and
getting
free
preventive
care
but
if
you
do
have
health
insurance
and
you
trying
to
get
it
through
the
individual
market
and
it
too
expensive
or
it
too
restricted
you
now
have
these
where
they
going
to
offer
you
better
deal
because
of
choice
and
competition
and
if
even
at
those
lower
rates
and
better
insurance
that
you
getting
through
these
you
still
afford
it
you
going
to
be
getting
tax
cuts
and
tax
credits
through
the
affordable
care
act
that
will
help
you
afford
it
and
that
how
we
going
to
make
sure
that
millions
of
people
who
do
currently
have
health
insurance
or
are
getting
really
bad
deal
on
their
health
insurance
are
finally
going
to
get
it
but
and
here
my
final
point
to
take
advantage
of
these
folks
are
going
to
need
to
sign
up
so
you
can
find
out
how
to
sign
up
at
or
here
in
california
you
can
sign
up
at
because
quality
care
is
not
something
that
should
be
privilege
it
should
be
right
in
the
greatest
country
on
earth
we
got
to
make
sure
that
every
single
person
that
needs
health
care
can
get
it
and
we
got
to
make
sure
that
we
do
it
in
the
most
efficient
way
possible
one
last
point
going
to
make
on
this
because
there
are
lot
of
people
who
currently
get
health
insurance
through
their
employers
the
percent
who
are
already
out
there
and
they
may
be
saying
well
if
this
law
is
so
great
why
is
it
that
my
premium
still
went
up
well
part
of
what
happening
across
the
country
is
in
some
cases
for
example
employers
may
be
shifting
more
costs
through
higher
premiums
or
higher
or
higher
and
so
there
may
still
be
folks
who
are
out
there
feeling
increased
costs
not
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
but
because
those
costs
are
being
passed
on
to
workers
or
insurance
companies
in
some
cases
even
with
these
laws
in
place
they
still
jacking
up
prices
unnecessarily
so
this
does
solve
the
whole
problem
but
it
moves
us
in
the
right
direction
also
the
reason
why
we
have
to
keep
on
implementing
changes
in
how
our
health
care
system
works
to
continually
drive
better
efficiency
higher
quality
lower
cost
starting
to
do
that
health
care
cost
inflation
has
gone
up
at
the
lowest
rate
over
the
last
three
years
that
seen
in
many
many
years
so
making
progress
in
actually
reducing
overall
health
care
costs
while
improving
quality
but
going
to
have
to
continue
to
push
on
that
front
as
well
that
also
part
of
what
doing
in
the
affordable
care
act
but
the
main
message
want
for
and
people
all
across
the
country
starting
on
october
if
in
the
individual
market
you
can
get
better
deal
if
small
business
that
providing
health
insurance
to
your
employees
you
can
get
better
deal
through
these
exchanges
got
to
sign
up
or
here
in
california
at
all
right
so
thank
you
very
much
question
president
president
going
to
take
one
question
and
then
remember
people
are
going
to
have
opportunities
to
also
answer
questions
when
with
the
chinese
president
today
so
do
want
the
whole
day
to
just
be
bleeding
press
conference
but
going
to
take
question
question
president
could
you
please
react
to
the
reports
of
secret
government
surveillance
of
phones
and
internet
and
can
you
also
assure
americans
that
the
government
your
government
does
have
some
massive
secret
database
of
all
their
personal
information
and
activities
president
yes
when
came
into
this
office
made
two
commitments
that
are
more
important
than
any
commitment
made
number
one
to
keep
the
american
people
safe
and
number
two
to
uphold
the
constitution
and
that
includes
what
consider
to
be
constitutional
right
to
privacy
and
an
observance
of
civil
liberties
now
the
programs
that
have
been
discussed
over
the
last
couple
days
in
the
press
are
secret
in
the
sense
that
they
classified
but
they
not
secret
in
the
sense
that
when
it
comes
to
telephone
calls
every
member
of
congress
has
been
briefed
on
this
program
with
respect
to
all
these
programs
the
relevant
intelligence
committees
are
fully
briefed
on
these
programs
these
are
programs
that
have
been
by
broad
bipartisan
majorities
repeatedly
since
and
so
think
at
the
outset
it
important
to
understand
that
your
duly
elected
representatives
have
been
consistently
informed
on
exactly
what
we
doing
now
let
me
take
the
two
issues
separately
when
it
comes
to
telephone
calls
nobody
is
listening
to
your
telephone
calls
not
what
this
program
is
about
as
was
indicated
what
the
intelligence
community
is
doing
is
looking
at
phone
numbers
and
durations
of
calls
they
are
not
looking
at
people
names
and
they
not
looking
at
content
but
by
sifting
through
this
they
may
identify
potential
leads
with
respect
to
folks
who
might
engage
in
terrorism
if
these
folks
if
the
intelligence
community
then
actually
wants
to
listen
to
phone
call
they
got
to
go
back
to
federal
judge
just
like
they
would
in
criminal
investigation
so
want
to
be
very
clear
some
of
the
hype
that
we
been
hearing
over
the
last
day
or
so
nobody
is
listening
to
the
content
of
people
phone
calls
this
program
by
the
way
is
fully
overseen
not
just
by
congress
but
by
the
court
court
specially
put
together
to
evaluate
classified
programs
to
make
sure
that
the
executive
branch
or
government
generally
is
not
abusing
them
and
that
it
being
carried
out
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
rule
of
law
and
so
not
only
does
that
court
the
initial
gathering
of
data
but
want
to
repeat
if
anybody
in
government
wanted
to
go
further
than
just
that
data
and
want
to
for
example
listen
to
phone
call
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
federal
judge
and
indicate
why
in
fact
they
were
doing
further
probing
now
with
respect
to
the
internet
and
this
does
not
apply
to
citizens
and
it
does
not
apply
to
people
living
in
the
united
states
and
again
in
this
instance
not
only
is
congress
fully
apprised
of
it
but
what
is
also
true
is
that
the
court
has
to
it
so
in
summary
what
you
got
is
two
programs
that
were
originally
by
congress
have
been
repeatedly
by
congress
bipartisan
majorities
have
approved
on
them
congress
is
continually
briefed
on
how
these
are
conducted
there
are
whole
range
of
safeguards
involved
and
federal
judges
are
overseeing
the
entire
program
throughout
we
also
setting
up
we
also
set
up
an
audit
process
when
came
into
office
to
make
sure
that
we
after
the
fact
making
absolutely
certain
that
all
the
safeguards
are
being
properly
observed
now
having
said
all
that
you
remember
when
made
that
couple
of
weeks
ago
about
the
need
for
us
to
shift
out
of
perpetual
war
mindset
specifically
said
that
one
of
the
things
that
we
going
to
have
to
discuss
and
debate
is
how
are
we
striking
this
balance
between
the
need
to
keep
the
american
people
safe
and
our
concerns
about
privacy
because
there
are
some
involved
welcome
this
debate
and
think
it
healthy
for
our
democracy
think
it
sign
of
maturity
because
probably
five
years
ago
six
years
ago
we
might
not
have
been
having
this
debate
and
think
it
interesting
that
there
are
some
folks
on
the
left
but
also
some
folks
on
the
right
who
are
now
worried
about
it
who
were
very
worried
about
it
when
there
was
republican
president
think
that
good
that
we
having
this
discussion
but
think
it
important
for
everybody
to
understand
and
think
the
american
people
understand
that
there
are
some
involved
came
in
with
healthy
about
these
programs
my
team
evaluated
them
we
scrubbed
them
thoroughly
we
actually
expanded
some
of
the
oversight
increased
some
of
safeguards
but
my
assessment
and
my
team
assessment
was
that
they
help
us
prevent
terrorist
attacks
and
the
modest
encroachments
on
the
privacy
that
are
involved
in
getting
phone
numbers
or
duration
without
name
attached
and
not
looking
at
content
that
on
net
it
was
worth
us
doing
some
other
folks
may
have
different
assessment
on
that
but
think
it
important
to
that
you
have
percent
security
and
also
then
have
percent
privacy
and
zero
inconvenience
we
going
to
have
to
make
some
choices
as
society
and
what
can
say
is
that
in
evaluating
these
programs
they
make
difference
in
our
capacity
to
anticipate
and
prevent
possible
terrorist
activity
and
the
fact
that
under
very
strict
supervision
by
all
three
branches
of
government
and
that
they
do
not
involve
listening
to
people
phone
calls
do
not
involve
reading
the
of
citizens
or
residents
absent
further
action
by
federal
court
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
what
we
would
do
for
example
in
criminal
investigation
think
on
balance
we
have
established
process
and
procedure
that
the
american
people
should
feel
comfortable
about
but
again
these
programs
are
subject
to
congressional
oversight
and
congressional
and
congressional
debate
and
if
there
are
members
of
congress
who
feel
differently
then
they
should
speak
up
and
we
happy
to
have
that
debate
okay
all
right
and
we
have
chance
to
talk
further
over
the
course
of
the
next
couple
of
days
question
do
you
welcome
the
leaks
sir
do
you
welcome
the
leaks
do
you
welcome
the
debate
president
do
welcome
leaks
because
there
reason
why
these
programs
are
classified
think
that
there
is
suggestion
that
somehow
any
classified
program
is
secret
program
which
means
it
somehow
suspicious
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
our
modern
history
there
are
whole
range
of
programs
that
have
been
classified
because
when
it
comes
to
for
example
fighting
terror
our
goal
is
to
stop
folks
from
doing
us
harm
and
if
every
step
that
taking
to
try
to
prevent
terrorist
act
is
on
the
front
page
of
the
newspapers
or
on
television
then
presumably
the
people
who
are
trying
to
do
us
harm
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
around
our
preventive
measures
that
why
these
things
are
classified
but
that
also
why
we
set
up
congressional
oversight
these
are
the
folks
you
all
vote
for
as
your
representatives
in
congress
and
they
being
fully
briefed
on
these
programs
and
if
in
fact
there
was
there
were
abuses
taking
place
presumably
those
members
of
congress
could
raise
those
issues
very
aggressively
they
empowered
to
do
so
we
also
have
federal
judges
that
we
put
in
place
who
are
not
subject
to
political
pressure
got
lifetime
tenure
as
federal
judges
and
they
empowered
to
look
over
our
shoulder
at
the
executive
branch
to
make
sure
that
these
programs
being
abused
so
we
have
system
in
which
some
information
is
classified
and
we
have
system
of
checks
and
balances
to
make
sure
that
not
abused
and
if
in
fact
this
information
ends
up
just
being
dumped
out
without
regard
to
risks
to
the
program
risks
to
the
people
involved
in
some
cases
on
other
leaks
risks
to
personnel
in
very
dangerous
situation
then
very
hard
for
us
to
be
as
effective
in
protecting
the
american
people
that
not
to
suggest
that
you
just
say
trust
me
doing
the
right
thing
we
know
who
the
bad
guys
are
and
the
reason
that
not
how
it
works
is
because
got
congressional
oversight
and
judicial
oversight
and
if
people
trust
not
only
the
executive
branch
but
also
do
trust
congress
and
do
trust
federal
judges
to
make
sure
that
abiding
by
the
constitution
due
process
and
rule
of
law
then
going
to
have
some
problems
here
but
my
observation
is
is
that
the
people
who
are
involved
in
national
security
they
take
this
work
very
seriously
they
cherish
our
constitution
the
last
thing
be
doing
is
taking
programs
like
this
to
listen
to
phone
calls
and
by
the
way
with
respect
to
my
concerns
about
privacy
issues
will
leave
this
office
at
some
point
sometime
in
the
last
next
three
and
half
years
and
after
that
will
be
private
citizen
and
suspect
that
on
list
of
people
who
might
be
targeted
so
that
somebody
could
read
their
or
listen
to
their
phone
calls
probably
be
pretty
high
on
that
list
it
not
as
if
do
have
personal
interest
in
making
sure
my
privacy
is
protected
but
know
that
the
people
who
are
involved
in
these
programs
they
operate
like
professionals
and
these
things
are
very
narrowly
circumscribed
they
very
focused
and
in
the
abstract
you
can
complain
about
big
brother
and
how
this
is
potential
program
run
amuck
but
when
you
actually
look
at
the
details
then
think
we
struck
the
right
balance
thank
you
very
much
guys
that
it
thank
you
hello
well
thank
you
governor
for
your
kind
introduction
and
the
great
support
that
gives
this
academy
to
secretary
admiral
general
thank
you
all
for
your
incredible
leadership
of
our
extraordinary
navy
and
marine
corps
teams
to
vice
admiral
miller
thank
you
for
the
outstanding
work
that
you
do
to
captain
and
all
the
faculty
and
staff
to
the
moms
and
dads
who
raised
your
sons
and
daughters
to
seek
this
life
of
service
to
the
local
sponsor
families
who
cared
for
them
far
from
home
the
members
of
the
class
of
veterans
guided
these
along
the
way
today
is
also
tribute
to
your
support
and
your
patriotism
and
know
that
the
class
of
joins
me
in
saluting
your
service
as
well
to
the
entire
brigade
of
you
embody
the
highest
virtues
of
this
venerable
institution
and
yet
know
that
some
of
you
at
times
have
enjoyed
yourselves
at
other
local
institutions
like
and
but
today
is
day
of
celebration
and
also
forgiveness
and
so
in
keeping
with
tradition
declare
all
on
restriction
for
minor
conduct
are
hereby
absolved
as
always
admiral
miller
gets
to
decide
some
of
these
guys
are
laughing
little
nervously
about
that
now
obviously
most
of
all
it
is
wonderful
to
be
able
to
celebrate
this
incredible
class
of
this
has
special
meaning
for
me
as
well
because
the
united
states
naval
academy
was
the
very
first
service
academy
that
had
the
privilege
to
address
as
president
on
that
spring
day
four
years
ago
most
of
you
were
still
in
high
school
finishing
your
senior
year
or
at
naps
finishing
up
prep
school
you
were
little
younger
and
was
too
you
had
your
entire
naval
academy
experience
ahead
of
you
was
already
getting
chest
bumps
from
the
graduates
of
soon
after
you
came
to
the
yard
and
you
got
quite
welcome
the
joy
of
wonderful
haircuts
stylish
eyeglasses
and
all
that
year
if
you
got
something
wrong
your
kindly
corrected
you
at
high
volume
at
very
close
range
when
brought
our
daughter
here
for
visit
she
got
somewhat
different
reception
she
was
just
in
elementary
school
but
it
seemed
like
the
navy
was
already
doing
some
recruiting
because
as
she
went
through
hall
she
came
to
one
room
and
saw
the
name
on
the
door
class
of
so
you
never
know
today
each
of
you
can
take
enormous
pride
for
met
the
mission
of
this
academy
proven
yourselves
morally
living
concept
of
and
integrity
and
this
includes
treating
one
another
with
respect
and
the
strength
of
every
member
of
your
team
the
most
diverse
class
to
graduate
in
naval
academy
history
and
among
the
many
proud
young
women
graduating
today
will
serve
on
submarines
proven
yourselves
mentally
now
know
that
some
think
of
this
as
just
small
engineering
school
on
the
not
only
met
its
rigorous
standards
helped
this
academy
earn
new
distinction
the
public
liberal
arts
school
in
america
and
proven
yourselves
physically
climb
of
two
minutes
five
seconds
now
that
they
put
the
grease
back
on
no
one
will
ever
match
your
time
more
importantly
last
month
welcomed
coach
ken
and
the
team
back
to
the
white
house
because
you
beat
air
force
you
beat
army
and
you
brought
the
trophy
back
to
so
class
of
in
your
four
years
by
the
bay
met
every
test
before

today
is
the
day
that
been
counting
down
to

so
long

take
your
oath

boards
and
gold

be
placed
on
your
shoulders

as

each
of
you
on
becoming
our
newest
officers

the
united
states
navy
second
lieutenants
in
the
united
states
marine
corps
and
soon
you
will
join
the
fleet
lead
marines
and
just
as
changed
over
the
past
four
years
so
too
have
the
challenges
facing
our
military
before
you
arrived
here
our
nation
was
engaged
in
two
wars
leadership
was
entrenched
in
their
safe
havens
many
of
our
alliances
were
strained
and
our
standing
in
the
world
had
suffered
and
over
the
past
four
years
strengthened
our
alliances
and
restored
image
in
the
world
the
war
in
iraq
is
over
and
we
welcomed
our
troops
home
thanks
to
our
brave
personnel
including
our
incredible
navy
seals
we
delivered
justice
to
bin
laden
in
the
transition
is
our
troops
are
coming
home
and
by
the
end
of
next
year
our
war
in
will
come
to
an
end
and
today
we
salute
all
the
americans
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
in
these
wars
including
graduates
of
this
academy
we
them
all
now
and
forever
yesterday
spoke
about
the
way
forward
in
the
fight
to
keep
our
country
secure
for
even
as
we
decimated
the
leadership
we
still
face
threats
from
affiliates
and
from
individuals
caught
up
in
its
ideology
even
as
we
move
beyond
deploying
large
ground
armies
abroad
we
still
need
to
conduct
precise
targeted
strikes
against
terrorists
before
they
kill
our
citizens
and
even
as
we
stay
vigilant
in
the
face
of
terrorism
and
stay
true
to
our
constitution
and
our
values
we
need
to
stay
ready
for
the
full
range
of
threats
from
nations
seeking
weapons
of
mass
destruction
to
criminals
seeking
to
unleash
weapons
of
mass
destruction
in
these
tough
fiscal
times
we
also
have
to
make
hard
choices
at
home
including
in
our
armed
forces
but
want
you
all
to
know
as
you
enter
in
what
know
will
be
extraordinary
years
of
service
let
me
say
as
clearly
as
can
the
united
states
of
america
will
always
maintain
our
military
superiority
and
as
your
going
to
keep
fighting
to
give
you
the
equipment
and
support
required
to
meet
the
missions
we
ask
of
you
and
also
to
make
sure
that
you
are
getting
the
pay
and
the
benefits
and
the
support
that
you
deserve
keep
fighting
for
the
capabilities
and
technologies
you
need
to
prevail
and
shipbuilding
plan
that
puts
us
on
track
to
achieve
fleet
with
capabilities
that
exceed
the
power
of
the
next
dozen
navies
combined
and
keep
fighting
to
end
those
foolish
budget
cuts
known
as
the
which
is
threatening
our
readiness
with
deficits
falling
at
the
fastest
rate
in
decades
time
for
congress
to
budget
in
smarter
way
that
protects
priorities
preserves
investments
in
our
future
and
keeps
our
military
strong
because
we
have
the
military
in
history
and
am
determined
to
keep
it
that
way
and
congress
should
be
too
we
need
you
to
project
power
across
the
oceans
from
the
pacific
to
the
persian
gulf
percent
on
watch
we
need
you
to
partner
with
other
navies
and
from
africa
to
the
we
need
you
to
respond
with
compassion
in
times
of
disaster
as
when
you
helped
respond
to
hurricane
sandy
and
in
all
your
work
in
your
lifetime
of
service
we
need
you
to
uphold
the
highest
standards
of
integrity
and
character
with
the
time
have
left
and
know
little
wet
but
the
superintendent
told
me
that
marines
and
folks
in
the
navy
do
mind
little
water
with
the
time
have
left
what
want
to
discuss
today
no
secret
that
in
recent
decades
many
americans
have
lost
confidence
in
many
of
the
institutions
that
help
shape
our
society
and
our
democracy
but
suggest
to
you
today
that
institutions
do
not
fail
in
vacuum
institutions
are
made
up
of
people
individuals
and
seen
how
the
actions
of
few
can
undermine
the
integrity
of
those
institutions
every
day
men
and
women
of
talent
and
skill
work
in
the
financial
institutions
that
fund
new
businesses
and
put
new
families
put
families
in
new
homes
and
help
students
go
to
college
but
also
seen
how
the
misdeeds
of
some
wild
or
putting
profits
before
people
sparked
financial
crisis
and
deepened
the
recession
that
cost
millions
of
americans
their
jobs
every
day
elected
officials
like
those
on
this
stage
but
also
all
across
the
nation
devote
themselves
to
improving
our
communities
and
our
country
but
all
too
often
seen
politics
where
compromise
is
rejected
as
dirty
word
and
policies
are
driven
by
special
interests
rather
than
the
national
interest
and
that
breeds
cynicism
that
threatens
our
democracy
every
day
our
civil
servants
do
their
jobs
with
professionalism
protecting
our
national
security
and
delivering
the
services
that
so
many
americans
expect
but
as
seen
again
in
recent
days
it
only
takes
the
misconduct
of
few
to
further
erode
the
trust
in
their
government
unacceptable
to
me
and
know
unacceptable
to
you
and
against
this
backdrop
what
said
here
four
years
ago
remains
true
today
our
military
remains
the
most
trusted
institution
in
america
when
others
have
shirked
their
responsibilities
our
armed
forces
have
met
every
mission
given
them
when
others
have
been
distracted
by
petty
arguments
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
come
together
as
one
american
team
and
yet
we
must
acknowledge
that
even
here
even
in
our
military
seen
how
the
misconduct
of
some
can
have
effects
that
ripple
far
and
wide
in
our
digital
age
single
image
from
the
battlefield
of
troops
falling
short
of
their
standards
can
go
viral
and
endanger
our
forces
and
undermine
our
efforts
to
achieve
security
and
peace
likewise
those
who
commit
sexual
assault
are
not
only
committing
crime
they
threaten
the
trust
and
discipline
that
make
our
military
strong
why
we
have
to
be
determined
to
stop
these
crimes
because
got
no
place
in
the
greatest
military
on
earth
so
class
of
say
all
this
because
about
to
assume
the
burden
of
leadership
as
officers
you
will
be
trusted
with
the
most
awesome
of
responsibilities
the
lives
of
the
men
and
women
under
your
command
and
when
your
service
is
complete
many
of
you
will
go
on
to
help
lead
your
communities
companies
you
will
lead
this
country
and
if
we
want
to
restore
the
trust
that
the
american
people
deserve
to
have
in
their
institutions
all
of
us
have
to
do
our
part
and
those
of
us
in
leadership
myself
included
have
to
constantly
strive
to
remain
worthy
of
the
public
trust
as
you
go
forward
in
your
careers
we
need
you
to
carry
forth
the
values
that
learned
at
this
institution
because
our
nation
needs
them
now
more
than
ever
we
need
your
that
inner
compass
that
guides
you
not
when
the
path
is
easy
and
obvious
but
when
hard
and
uncertain
that
tells
you
the
difference
between
that
which
is
right
and
that
which
is
wrong
perhaps
it
will
be
moment
when
you
think
nobody
is
watching
but
never
forget
that
like
character
is
what
you
do
when
nobody
is
looking
more
likely
it
will
be
when
in
the
spotlight
leading
others
the
men
and
women
who
are
looking
up
to
you
to
set
an
example
never
ask
them
to
do
what
you
ask
of
yourself
live
with
integrity
and
speak
with
honesty
and
take
responsibility
and
demand
accountability
we
need
your
and
we
need
your
courage
yes
the
daring
that
tells
you
to
move
toward
danger
when
every
of
your
being
says
to
turn
the
other
way
but
even
more
than
physical
courage
we
need
your
moral
courage
the
strength
to
do
right
especially
when
unpopular
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
at
the
end
of
your
career
you
want
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
say
with
confidence
and
with
pride
fulfilled
my
oath
did
my
duty
stayed
true
to
my
values
we
need
your
and
courage
and
we
need
your
commitment
that
sense
of
purpose
that
says
will
try
even
harder
will
do
even
better
in
what
expect
of
myself
in
the
way
interact
with
others
including
those
of
different
backgrounds
it
no
accident
that
our
military
is
the
most
respected
institution
in
america
and
one
of
the
most
diverse
institutions
in
america
so
the
dignity
in
every
human
being
treat
one
another
with
respect
remember
that
when
we
harness
the
talents
of
every
man
and
every
woman
from
every
race
and
every
religion
and
every
creed
no
nation
can
ever
match
us
and
finally
we
need
your
resolve
the
same
spirit
reflected
in
your
class
motto
to
if
you
seek
an
example
you
do
need
to
look
far
because
not
long
ago
two
sat
where
you
sat
from
the
class
of
and
they
inspire
us
today
here
at
the
academy
was
the
captain
of
the
swim
team
he
deployed
to
and
while
rushing
to
the
aid
of
his
teammates
he
stepped
on
an
and
lost
both
his
eyes
with
the
support
of
family
and
friends
learned
to
feel
his
way
and
move
again
and
before
long
he
was
back
in
the
swimming
pool
where
he
said
then
just
one
year
later
competed
at
the
london
and
won
three
medals
including
two
golds
and
when
and
welcomed
our
to
the
white
house
joined
us
standing
tall
right
in
front
and
he
said
adversity
is
decision
you
can
let
that
beat
you
or
you
can
make
the
decision
to
move
here
at
the
academy
matt
was
on
the
rowing
team
he
deployed
to
with
his
marine
special
team
and
as
they
entered
compound
an
exploded
and
matt
lost
both
his
legs
he
endured
long
and
painful
recovery
but
with
his
new
legs
he
learned
to
walk
again
he
he
trained
and
then
he
passed
his
physical
tests
and
deployed
to
again
double
amputee
back
in
the
fight
and
matt
recently
completed
his
tour
he
is
back
home
and
is
looking
ahead
to
many
years
of
service
reflecting
on
his
journey
his
mission
to
return
to
his
unit
he
said
he
was
determined
long
it
was
going
to
so
class
of
can
not
promise
you
life
of
comfort
and
ease
for
you
have
chosen
an
ancient
path
the
profession
of
arms
which
carries
all
the
perils
of
our
modern
world
and
just
as
classes
before
you
could
not
know
that
they
would
find
themselves
at
coral
sea
or
midway
or
or
we
can
not
know
sitting
here
today
where
your
service
will
carry
you
but
do
know
this
as
you
say
farewell
to
hall
as
you
make
your
way
down
walk
one
last
time
becoming
the
newest
link
in
chain
as
look
into
your
eyes
today
see
the
same
confidence
and
the
same
professionalism
the
same
fidelity
to
our
values
of
those
served
before
you
the
and
and
and
and
yes
the
and
the
americans
who
surrendered
to
nothing
and
absolutely
confident
that
you
will
uphold
the
highest
of
standards
and
that
your
courage
and
and
your
commitment
will
see
us
through
and
that
you
will
always
prove
yourselves
worthy
of
the
trust
our
nation
is
placing
in
you
today
so
congratulations
class
of
god
bless
our
navy
and
god
bless
our
marine
corps
god
bless
our
armed
services
god
bless
these
united
states
of
america
it
is
great
to
return
to
the
national
university
here
at
fort
americans
have
served
in
uniform
since
standing
guard
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
republic
and
contemplating
the
future
of
warfare
here
in
the
century
for
over
two
centuries
the
united
states
has
been
bound
together
by
founding
documents
that
defined
who
we
are
as
americans
and
served
as
our
compass
through
every
type
of
change
matters
of
war
and
peace
are
no
different
americans
are
deeply
ambivalent
about
war
but
having
fought
for
our
independence
we
know
price
must
be
paid
for
freedom
from
the
civil
war
to
our
struggle
against
fascism
on
through
the
long
twilight
struggle
of
the
cold
war
battlefields
have
changed
and
technology
has
evolved
but
our
commitment
to
constitutional
principles
has
weathered
every
war
and
every
war
has
come
to
an
end
with
the
collapse
of
the
berlin
wall
new
dawn
of
democracy
took
hold
abroad
and
decade
of
peace
and
prosperity
arrived
here
at
home
and
for
moment
it
seemed
the
century
would
be
tranquil
time
and
then
on
september
we
were
shaken
out
of
complacency
thousands
were
taken
from
us
as
clouds
of
fire
and
metal
and
ash
descended
upon
morning
this
was
different
kind
of
war
no
armies
came
to
our
shores
and
our
military
was
not
the
principal
target
instead
group
of
terrorists
came
to
kill
as
many
civilians
as
they
could
and
so
our
nation
went
to
war
we
have
now
been
at
war
for
well
over
decade
review
the
full
history
what
is
clear
is
that
we
quickly
drove
out
of
but
then
shifted
our
focus
and
began
new
war
in
iraq
and
this
carried
significant
consequences
for
our
fight
against
our
standing
in
the
world
and
to
this
day
our
interests
in
vital
region
meanwhile
we
strengthened
our
defenses
hardening
targets
tightening
transportation
security
giving
law
enforcement
new
tools
to
prevent
terror
most
of
these
changes
were
sound
some
caused
inconvenience
but
some
like
expanded
surveillance
raised
difficult
questions
about
the
balance
that
we
strike
between
our
interests
in
security
and
our
values
of
privacy
and
in
some
cases
believe
we
compromised
our
basic
values
by
using
torture
to
interrogate
our
enemies
and
detaining
individuals
in
way
that
ran
counter
to
the
rule
of
law
so
after
took
office
we
stepped
up
the
war
against
but
we
also
sought
to
change
its
course
we
relentlessly
targeted
leadership
we
ended
the
war
in
iraq
and
brought
nearly
troops
home
we
pursued
new
strategy
in
and
increased
our
training
of
afghan
forces
we
unequivocally
banned
torture
affirmed
our
commitment
to
civilian
courts
worked
to
align
our
policies
with
the
rule
of
law
and
expanded
our
consultations
with
congress
today
bin
laden
is
dead
and
so
are
most
of
his
top
lieutenants
there
have
been
no
attacks
on
the
united
states
and
our
homeland
is
more
secure
fewer
of
our
troops
are
in
way
and
over
the
next
months
they
will
continue
to
come
home
our
alliances
are
strong
and
so
is
our
standing
in
the
world
in
sum
we
are
safer
because
of
our
efforts
now
make
no
mistake
our
nation
is
still
threatened
by
terrorists
from
to
boston
we
have
been
tragically
reminded
of
that
truth
but
we
have
to
that
the
threat
has
shifted
and
evolved
from
the
one
that
came
to
our
shores
on
with
decade
of
experience
now
to
draw
from
this
is
the
moment
to
ask
ourselves
hard
questions
about
the
nature
of
threats
and
how
we
should
confront
them
and
these
questions
matter
to
every
american
for
over
the
last
decade
our
nation
has
spent
well
over
trillion
dollars
on
war
helping
to
explode
our
deficits
and
constraining
our
ability
to
here
at
home
our
and
their
families
have
sacrificed
far
more
on
our
behalf
nearly
americans
have
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
many
more
have
left
part
of
themselves
on
the
battlefield
or
brought
the
shadows
of
battle
back
home
from
our
use
of
drones
to
the
detention
of
terrorist
suspects
the
decisions
that
we
are
making
now
will
define
the
type
of
nation
and
world
that
we
leave
to
our
children
so
america
is
at
crossroads
we
must
define
the
nature
and
scope
of
this
struggle
or
else
it
will
define
us
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
james
warning
that
nation
could
preserve
its
freedom
in
the
midst
of
continual
neither
nor
any
president
can
promise
the
total
defeat
of
terror
we
will
never
erase
the
evil
that
lies
in
the
hearts
of
some
human
beings
nor
stamp
out
every
danger
to
our
open
society
but
what
we
can
do
what
we
must
do
is
dismantle
networks
that
pose
direct
danger
to
us
and
make
it
less
likely
for
new
groups
to
gain
foothold
all
the
while
maintaining
the
freedoms
and
ideals
that
we
defend
and
to
define
that
strategy
we
have
to
make
decisions
based
not
on
fear
but
on
wisdom
that
begins
with
understanding
the
current
threat
that
we
face
today
the
core
of
in
and
pakistan
is
on
the
path
to
defeat
their
remaining
operatives
spend
more
time
thinking
about
their
own
safety
than
plotting
against
us
they
did
not
direct
the
attacks
in
or
boston
not
carried
out
successful
attack
on
our
homeland
since
instead
what
seen
is
the
emergence
of
various
affiliates
from
yemen
to
iraq
from
somalia
to
north
africa
the
threat
today
is
more
diffuse
with
affiliates
in
the
arabian
peninsula
the
most
active
in
plotting
against
our
homeland
and
while
none
of
efforts
approach
the
scale
of
they
have
continued
to
plot
acts
of
terror
like
the
attempt
to
blow
up
an
airplane
on
day
in
unrest
in
the
arab
world
has
also
allowed
extremists
to
gain
foothold
in
countries
like
libya
and
syria
but
here
too
there
are
differences
from
in
some
cases
we
continue
to
confront
networks
like
that
engage
in
acts
of
terror
to
achieve
political
goals
other
of
these
groups
are
simply
collections
of
local
militias
or
extremists
interested
in
seizing
territory
and
while
we
are
vigilant
for
signs
that
these
groups
may
pose
transnational
threat
most
are
focused
on
operating
in
the
countries
and
regions
where
they
are
based
and
that
means
we
face
more
threats
like
what
we
saw
in
or
the
oil
facility
in
algeria
in
which
local
operatives
perhaps
in
loose
affiliation
with
regional
networks
launch
periodic
attacks
against
western
diplomats
companies
and
other
soft
targets
or
resort
to
kidnapping
and
other
criminal
enterprises
to
fund
their
operations
and
finally
we
face
real
threat
from
individuals
here
in
the
united
states
whether
shooter
at
temple
in
plane
flying
into
building
in
texas
or
the
extremists
who
killed
people
at
the
federal
building
in
oklahoma
city
america
has
confronted
many
forms
of
violent
extremism
in
our
history
deranged
or
alienated
individuals
often
citizens
or
legal
residents
can
do
enormous
damage
particularly
when
inspired
by
larger
notions
of
violent
jihad
and
that
pull
towards
extremism
appears
to
have
led
to
the
shooting
at
fort
hood
and
the
bombing
of
the
boston
marathon
so
the
current
threat
lethal
yet
less
capable
affiliates
threats
to
diplomatic
facilities
and
businesses
abroad
extremists
this
is
the
future
of
terrorism
we
have
to
take
these
threats
seriously
and
do
all
that
we
can
to
confront
them
but
as
we
shape
our
response
we
have
to
that
the
scale
of
this
threat
closely
resembles
the
types
of
attacks
we
faced
before
in
the
we
lost
americans
to
terrorism
at
our
embassy
in
beirut
at
our
marine
barracks
in
lebanon
on
cruise
ship
at
sea
at
disco
in
berlin
and
on
pan
am
flight
flight
over
in
the
we
lost
americans
to
terrorism
at
the
world
trade
at
our
military
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
and
at
our
embassy
in
kenya
these
attacks
were
all
brutal
they
were
all
deadly
and
we
learned
that
left
unchecked
these
threats
can
grow
but
if
dealt
with
smartly
and
proportionally
these
threats
need
not
rise
to
the
level
that
we
saw
on
the
eve
of
moreover
we
have
to
that
these
threats
arise
in
vacuum
most
though
not
all
of
the
terrorism
we
faced
is
by
common
ideology
belief
by
some
extremists
that
islam
is
in
conflict
with
the
united
states
and
the
west
and
that
violence
against
western
targets
including
civilians
is
justified
in
pursuit
of
larger
cause
of
course
this
ideology
is
based
on
lie
for
the
united
states
is
not
at
war
with
islam
and
this
ideology
is
rejected
by
the
vast
majority
of
muslims
who
are
the
most
frequent
victims
of
terrorist
attacks
nevertheless
this
ideology
persists
and
in
an
age
when
ideas
and
images
can
travel
the
globe
in
an
instant
our
response
to
terrorism
depend
on
military
or
law
enforcement
alone
we
need
all
elements
of
national
power
to
win
battle
of
wills
battle
of
ideas
so
what
want
to
discuss
here
today
is
the
components
of
such
comprehensive
strategy
first
we
must
finish
the
work
of
defeating
and
its
associated
forces
in
we
will
complete
our
transition
to
afghan
responsibility
for
that
security
our
troops
will
come
home
our
combat
mission
will
come
to
an
end
and
we
will
work
with
the
afghan
government
to
train
security
forces
and
sustain
force
which
ensures
that
can
never
again
establish
safe
haven
to
launch
attacks
against
us
or
our
allies
beyond
we
must
define
our
effort
not
as
boundless
war
on
terror
but
rather
as
series
of
persistent
targeted
efforts
to
dismantle
specific
networks
of
violent
extremists
that
threaten
america
in
many
cases
this
will
involve
partnerships
with
other
countries
already
thousands
of
soldiers
have
lost
their
lives
fighting
extremists
in
yemen
we
are
supporting
security
forces
that
have
reclaimed
territory
from
in
somalia
we
helped
coalition
of
african
nations
push
out
of
its
strongholds
in
providing
military
aid
to
intervention
to
push
back
in
the
and
help
the
people
of
reclaim
their
future
much
of
our
best
cooperation
results
in
the
gathering
and
sharing
of
intelligence
the
arrest
and
prosecution
of
terrorists
and
how
somali
terrorist
apprehended
off
the
coast
of
yemen
is
now
in
prison
in
new
york
how
we
worked
with
european
allies
to
disrupt
plots
from
denmark
to
germany
to
the
united
kingdom
how
intelligence
collected
with
saudi
arabia
helped
us
stop
cargo
plane
from
being
blown
up
over
the
atlantic
these
partnerships
work
but
despite
our
strong
preference
for
the
detention
and
prosecution
of
terrorists
sometimes
this
approach
is
foreclosed
and
its
affiliates
try
to
gain
foothold
in
some
of
the
most
distant
and
unforgiving
places
on
earth
they
take
refuge
in
remote
tribal
regions
they
hide
in
caves
and
walled
compounds
they
train
in
empty
deserts
and
rugged
mountains
in
some
of
these
places
such
as
parts
of
somalia
and
yemen
the
state
only
has
the
most
tenuous
reach
into
the
territory
in
other
cases
the
state
lacks
the
capacity
or
will
to
take
action
and
also
not
possible
for
america
to
simply
deploy
team
of
special
forces
to
capture
every
terrorist
even
when
such
an
approach
may
be
possible
there
are
places
where
it
would
pose
profound
risks
to
our
troops
and
local
civilians
where
terrorist
compound
can
not
be
breached
without
triggering
firefight
with
surrounding
tribal
communities
for
example
that
pose
no
threat
to
us
times
when
putting
boots
on
the
ground
may
trigger
major
international
crisis
to
put
it
another
way
our
operation
in
pakistan
against
bin
laden
can
not
be
the
norm
the
risks
in
that
case
were
immense
the
likelihood
of
capture
although
that
was
our
preference
was
remote
given
the
certainty
that
our
folks
would
confront
resistance
the
fact
that
we
did
not
find
ourselves
confronted
with
civilian
casualties
or
embroiled
in
an
extended
firefight
was
testament
to
the
meticulous
planning
and
professionalism
of
our
special
forces
but
it
also
depended
on
some
luck
and
it
was
supported
by
massive
infrastructure
in
and
even
then
the
cost
to
our
relationship
with
pakistan
and
the
backlash
among
the
public
over
encroachment
on
their
territory
was
so
severe
that
we
are
just
now
beginning
to
rebuild
this
important
partnership
so
it
is
in
this
context
that
the
united
states
has
taken
lethal
targeted
action
against
and
its
associated
forces
including
with
remotely
piloted
aircraft
commonly
referred
to
as
drones
as
was
true
in
previous
armed
conflicts
this
new
technology
raises
profound
questions
about
who
is
targeted
and
why
about
civilian
casualties
and
the
risk
of
creating
new
enemies
about
the
legality
of
such
strikes
under
and
international
law
about
accountability
and
morality
so
let
me
address
these
questions
to
begin
with
our
actions
are
effective
take
my
word
for
it
in
the
intelligence
gathered
at
bin
compound
we
found
that
he
wrote
could
lose
the
reserves
to
air
strikes
we
can
not
fight
air
strikes
with
other
communications
from
operatives
confirm
this
as
well
dozens
of
highly
skilled
commanders
trainers
bomb
makers
and
operatives
have
been
taken
off
the
battlefield
plots
have
been
disrupted
that
would
have
targeted
international
aviation
transit
systems
european
cities
and
our
troops
in
simply
put
these
strikes
have
saved
lives
moreover
actions
are
legal
we
were
attacked
on
within
week
congress
overwhelmingly
the
use
of
force
under
domestic
law
and
international
law
the
united
states
is
at
war
with
the
and
their
associated
forces
we
are
at
war
with
an
that
right
now
would
kill
as
many
americans
as
they
could
if
we
did
not
stop
them
first
so
this
is
just
war
war
waged
proportionally
in
last
resort
and
in
and
yet
as
our
fight
enters
new
phase
legitimate
claim
of
can
not
be
the
end
of
the
discussion
to
say
military
tactic
is
legal
or
even
effective
is
not
to
say
it
is
wise
or
moral
in
every
instance
for
the
same
human
progress
that
gives
us
the
technology
to
strike
half
world
away
also
demands
the
discipline
to
constrain
that
power
or
risk
abusing
it
and
why
over
the
last
four
years
my
administration
has
worked
vigorously
to
establish
framework
that
governs
our
use
of
force
against
terrorists
insisting
upon
clear
guidelines
oversight
and
accountability
that
is
now
codified
in
presidential
policy
guidance
that
signed
yesterday
in
the
afghan
war
we
must
and
will
continue
to
support
our
troops
until
the
transition
is
complete
at
the
end
of
and
that
means
we
will
continue
to
take
strikes
against
high
value
targets
but
also
against
forces
that
are
massing
to
support
attacks
on
coalition
forces
but
by
the
end
of
we
will
no
longer
have
the
same
need
for
force
protection
and
the
progress
made
against
core
will
reduce
the
need
for
unmanned
strikes
beyond
the
afghan
we
only
target
and
its
associated
forces
and
even
then
the
use
of
drones
is
heavily
constrained
america
does
not
take
strikes
when
we
have
the
ability
to
capture
individual
terrorists
our
preference
is
always
to
detain
interrogate
and
prosecute
america
can
not
take
strikes
wherever
we
choose
our
actions
are
bound
by
consultations
with
partners
and
respect
for
state
sovereignty
america
does
not
take
strikes
to
punish
individuals
we
act
against
terrorists
who
pose
continuing
and
imminent
threat
to
the
american
people
and
when
there
are
no
other
governments
capable
of
effectively
addressing
the
threat
and
before
any
strike
is
taken
there
must
be
that
no
civilians
will
be
killed
or
injured
the
highest
standard
we
can
set
now
this
last
point
is
critical
because
much
of
the
criticism
about
drone
strikes
both
here
at
home
and
abroad
understandably
on
reports
of
civilian
casualties
wide
gap
between
assessments
of
such
casualties
and
reports
nevertheless
it
is
hard
fact
that
strikes
have
resulted
in
civilian
casualties
risk
that
exists
in
every
war
and
for
the
families
of
those
civilians
no
words
or
legal
construct
can
justify
their
loss
for
me
and
those
in
my
chain
of
command
those
deaths
will
haunt
us
as
long
as
we
live
just
as
we
are
haunted
by
the
civilian
casualties
that
have
occurred
throughout
conventional
fighting
in
and
iraq
but
as
must
weigh
these
heartbreaking
tragedies
against
the
alternatives
to
do
nothing
in
the
face
of
terrorist
networks
would
invite
far
more
civilian
casualties
not
just
in
our
cities
at
home
and
our
facilities
abroad
but
also
in
the
very
places
like
and
and
where
terrorists
seek
foothold
remember
that
the
terrorists
we
are
after
target
civilians
and
the
death
toll
from
their
acts
of
terrorism
against
muslims
dwarfs
any
estimate
of
civilian
casualties
from
drone
strikes
so
doing
nothing
is
not
an
option
where
foreign
governments
can
not
or
will
not
effectively
stop
terrorism
in
their
territory
the
primary
alternative
to
targeted
lethal
action
would
be
the
use
of
conventional
military
options
as
already
said
even
small
special
operations
carry
enormous
risks
conventional
or
missiles
are
far
less
precise
than
drones
and
are
likely
to
cause
more
civilian
casualties
and
more
local
outrage
and
invasions
of
these
territories
lead
us
to
be
viewed
as
occupying
armies
unleash
torrent
of
unintended
consequences
are
difficult
to
contain
result
in
large
numbers
of
civilian
casualties
and
ultimately
empower
those
who
thrive
on
violent
conflict
so
it
is
false
to
assert
that
putting
boots
on
the
ground
is
less
likely
to
result
in
civilian
deaths
or
less
likely
to
create
enemies
in
the
muslim
world
the
results
would
be
more
deaths
more
black
hawks
down
more
confrontations
with
local
populations
and
an
inevitable
mission
creep
in
support
of
such
raids
that
could
easily
escalate
into
new
wars
yes
the
conflict
with
like
all
armed
conflict
invites
tragedy
but
by
narrowly
targeting
our
action
against
those
who
want
to
kill
us
and
not
the
people
they
hide
among
we
are
choosing
the
course
of
action
least
likely
to
result
in
the
loss
of
innocent
life
our
efforts
must
be
measured
against
the
history
of
putting
american
troops
in
distant
lands
among
hostile
populations
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
civilians
died
in
war
where
the
boundaries
of
battle
were
blurred
in
iraq
and
despite
the
extraordinary
courage
and
discipline
of
our
troops
thousands
of
civilians
have
been
killed
so
neither
conventional
military
action
nor
waiting
for
attacks
to
occur
offers
moral
safe
and
neither
does
sole
reliance
on
law
enforcement
in
territories
that
have
no
functioning
police
or
security
services
and
indeed
have
no
functioning
law
now
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
risks
are
not
real
any
military
action
in
foreign
lands
risks
creating
more
enemies
and
impacts
public
opinion
overseas
moreover
our
laws
constrain
the
power
of
the
president
even
during
wartime
and
have
taken
an
oath
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
very
precision
of
drone
strikes
and
the
necessary
secrecy
often
involved
in
such
actions
can
end
up
shielding
our
government
from
the
public
scrutiny
that
troop
deployment
invites
it
can
also
lead
president
and
his
team
to
view
drone
strikes
as
for
terrorism
and
for
this
reason
insisted
on
strong
oversight
of
all
lethal
action
after
took
office
my
administration
began
briefing
all
strikes
outside
of
iraq
and
to
the
appropriate
committees
of
congress
let
me
repeat
that
not
only
did
congress
the
use
of
force
it
is
briefed
on
every
strike
that
america
takes
every
strike
that
includes
the
one
instance
when
we
targeted
an
american
citizen
the
chief
of
external
operations
for
this
week
the
declassification
of
this
action
and
the
deaths
of
three
other
americans
in
drone
strikes
to
facilitate
transparency
and
debate
on
this
issue
and
to
dismiss
some
of
the
more
outlandish
claims
that
have
been
made
for
the
record
do
not
believe
it
would
be
constitutional
for
the
government
to
target
and
kill
any
citizen
with
drone
or
with
shotgun
without
due
process
nor
should
any
president
deploy
armed
drones
over
soil
but
when
citizen
goes
abroad
to
wage
war
against
america
and
is
actively
plotting
to
kill
citizens
and
when
neither
the
united
states
nor
our
partners
are
in
position
to
capture
him
before
he
carries
out
plot
his
citizenship
should
no
more
serve
as
shield
than
sniper
shooting
down
on
an
innocent
crowd
should
be
protected
from
swat
team
who
was
he
was
continuously
trying
to
kill
people
he
helped
oversee
the
plot
to
detonate
explosive
devices
on
two
cargo
planes
he
was
involved
in
planning
to
blow
up
an
airliner
in
when
the
day
bomber
went
to
yemen
in
hosted
him
approved
his
suicide
operation
helped
him
tape
martyrdom
video
to
be
shown
after
the
attack
and
his
last
instructions
were
to
blow
up
the
airplane
when
it
was
over
american
soil
would
have
detained
and
prosecuted
if
we
captured
him
before
he
carried
out
plot
but
we
and
as
president
would
have
been
derelict
in
my
duty
had
not
the
strike
that
took
him
out
of
course
the
targeting
of
any
american
raises
constitutional
issues
that
are
not
present
in
other
strikes
which
is
why
my
administration
submitted
information
about
to
the
department
of
justice
months
before
was
killed
and
briefed
the
congress
before
this
strike
as
well
but
the
high
threshold
that
set
for
taking
lethal
action
applies
to
all
potential
terrorist
targets
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
are
american
citizens
this
threshold
respects
the
inherent
dignity
of
every
human
life
alongside
the
decision
to
put
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
in
way
the
decision
to
use
force
against
individuals
or
groups
even
against
sworn
enemy
of
the
united
states
is
the
hardest
thing
do
as
president
but
these
decisions
must
be
made
given
my
responsibility
to
protect
the
american
people
going
forward
asked
my
administration
to
review
proposals
to
extend
oversight
of
lethal
actions
outside
of
that
go
beyond
our
reporting
to
congress
each
option
has
virtues
in
theory
but
poses
difficulties
in
practice
for
example
the
establishment
of
special
court
to
evaluate
and
lethal
action
has
the
benefit
of
bringing
third
branch
of
government
into
the
process
but
raises
serious
constitutional
issues
about
presidential
and
judicial
authority
another
idea
been
suggested
the
establishment
of
an
independent
oversight
board
in
the
executive
branch
avoids
those
problems
but
may
introduce
layer
of
bureaucracy
into
national
security
without
inspiring
additional
public
confidence
in
the
process
but
despite
these
challenges
look
forward
to
actively
engaging
congress
to
explore
these
and
other
options
for
increased
oversight
believe
however
that
the
use
of
force
must
be
seen
as
part
of
larger
discussion
we
need
to
have
about
comprehensive
strategy
because
for
all
the
focus
on
the
use
of
force
force
alone
can
not
make
us
safe
we
can
not
use
force
everywhere
that
radical
ideology
takes
root
and
in
the
absence
of
strategy
that
reduces
the
of
extremism
perpetual
war
through
drones
or
special
forces
or
troop
deployments
will
prove
and
alter
our
country
in
troubling
ways
so
the
next
element
of
our
strategy
involves
addressing
the
underlying
grievances
and
conflicts
that
feed
extremism
from
north
africa
to
south
asia
as
learned
this
past
decade
this
is
vast
and
complex
undertaking
we
must
be
humble
in
our
expectation
that
we
can
quickly
resolve
problems
like
poverty
and
sectarian
hatred
moreover
no
two
countries
are
alike
and
some
will
undergo
chaotic
change
before
things
get
better
but
our
security
and
our
values
demand
that
we
make
the
effort
this
means
patiently
supporting
transitions
to
democracy
in
places
like
egypt
and
tunisia
and
libya
because
the
peaceful
of
individual
aspirations
will
serve
as
rebuke
to
violent
extremists
we
must
strengthen
the
opposition
in
syria
while
isolating
extremist
elements
because
the
end
of
tyrant
must
not
give
way
to
the
tyranny
of
terrorism
we
are
actively
working
to
promote
peace
between
israelis
and
because
it
is
right
and
because
such
peace
could
help
reshape
attitudes
in
the
region
and
we
must
help
countries
economies
upgrade
education
and
encourage
entrepreneurship
because
american
leadership
has
always
been
elevated
by
our
ability
to
connect
with
hopes
and
not
simply
their
fears
and
success
on
all
these
fronts
requires
sustained
engagement
but
it
will
also
require
resources
know
that
foreign
aid
is
one
of
the
least
popular
expenditures
that
there
is
true
for
democrats
and
republicans
seen
the
polling
even
though
it
amounts
to
less
than
one
percent
of
the
federal
budget
in
fact
lot
of
folks
think
percent
if
you
ask
people
on
the
streets
less
than
one
percent
still
wildly
unpopular
but
foreign
assistance
can
not
be
viewed
as
charity
it
is
fundamental
to
our
national
security
and
fundamental
to
any
sensible
strategy
to
battle
extremism
moreover
foreign
assistance
is
tiny
fraction
of
what
we
spend
fighting
wars
that
our
assistance
might
ultimately
prevent
for
what
we
spent
in
month
in
iraq
at
the
height
of
the
war
we
could
be
training
security
forces
in
libya
maintaining
peace
agreements
between
israel
and
its
feeding
the
hungry
in
yemen
building
schools
in
pakistan
and
creating
reservoirs
of
goodwill
that
extremists
that
has
to
be
part
of
our
strategy
moreover
america
can
not
carry
out
this
work
if
we
have
diplomats
serving
in
some
very
dangerous
places
over
the
past
decade
we
have
strengthened
security
at
our
embassies
and
am
implementing
every
recommendation
of
the
accountability
review
board
which
found
unacceptable
failures
in
called
on
congress
to
fully
fund
these
efforts
to
bolster
security
and
harden
facilities
improve
intelligence
and
facilitate
quicker
response
time
from
our
military
if
crisis
emerges
but
even
after
we
take
these
steps
some
irreducible
risks
to
our
diplomats
will
remain
this
is
the
price
of
being
the
most
powerful
nation
particularly
as
wave
of
change
washes
over
the
arab
world
and
in
balancing
the
between
security
and
active
diplomacy
firmly
believe
that
any
retreat
from
challenging
regions
will
only
increase
the
dangers
that
we
face
in
the
long
run
and
that
why
we
should
be
grateful
to
those
diplomats
who
are
willing
to
serve
targeted
action
against
terrorists
effective
partnerships
diplomatic
engagement
and
assistance
through
such
comprehensive
strategy
we
can
significantly
reduce
the
chances
of
attacks
on
the
homeland
and
mitigate
threats
to
americans
overseas
but
as
we
guard
against
dangers
from
abroad
we
can
not
neglect
the
daunting
challenge
of
terrorism
from
within
our
borders
as
said
earlier
this
threat
is
not
new
but
technology
and
the
internet
increase
its
frequency
and
in
some
cases
its
lethality
today
person
can
consume
hateful
propaganda
commit
themselves
to
violent
agenda
and
learn
how
to
kill
without
leaving
their
home
to
address
this
threat
two
years
ago
my
administration
did
comprehensive
review
and
engaged
with
law
enforcement
and
the
best
way
to
prevent
violent
extremism
inspired
by
violent
is
to
work
with
the
muslim
american
community
which
has
consistently
rejected
terrorism
to
identify
signs
of
and
partner
with
law
enforcement
when
an
individual
is
drifting
towards
violence
and
these
partnerships
can
only
work
when
we
that
muslims
are
fundamental
part
of
the
american
family
in
fact
the
success
of
american
muslims
and
our
determination
to
guard
against
any
encroachments
on
their
civil
liberties
is
the
ultimate
rebuke
to
those
who
say
that
at
war
with
islam
thwarting
plots
presents
particular
challenges
in
part
because
of
our
proud
commitment
to
civil
liberties
for
all
who
call
america
home
why
in
the
years
to
come
we
will
have
to
keep
working
hard
to
strike
the
appropriate
balance
between
our
need
for
security
and
preserving
those
freedoms
that
make
us
who
we
are
that
means
reviewing
the
authorities
of
law
enforcement
so
we
can
intercept
new
types
of
communication
but
also
build
in
privacy
protections
to
prevent
abuse
that
means
that
even
after
boston
we
do
not
deport
someone
or
throw
somebody
in
prison
in
the
absence
of
evidence
that
means
putting
careful
constraints
on
the
tools
the
government
uses
to
protect
sensitive
information
such
as
the
state
secrets
doctrine
and
that
means
finally
having
strong
privacy
and
civil
liberties
board
to
review
those
issues
where
our
efforts
and
our
values
may
come
into
tension
the
justice
investigation
of
national
security
leaks
offers
recent
example
of
the
challenges
involved
in
striking
the
right
balance
between
our
security
and
our
open
society
as
believe
we
must
keep
information
secret
that
protects
our
operations
and
our
people
in
the
field
to
do
so
we
must
enforce
consequences
for
those
who
break
the
law
and
breach
their
commitment
to
protect
classified
information
but
free
press
is
also
essential
for
our
democracy
who
we
are
and
troubled
by
the
possibility
that
leak
investigations
may
chill
the
investigative
journalism
that
holds
government
accountable
journalists
should
not
be
at
legal
risk
for
doing
their
jobs
our
focus
must
be
on
those
who
break
the
law
and
why
called
on
congress
to
pass
media
shield
law
to
guard
against
government
overreach
and
raised
these
issues
with
the
attorney
general
who
shares
my
concerns
so
he
has
agreed
to
review
existing
department
of
justice
guidelines
governing
investigations
that
involve
reporters
and
convene
group
of
media
to
hear
their
concerns
as
part
of
that
review
and
directed
the
attorney
general
to
report
back
to
me
by
july
now
all
these
issues
remind
us
that
the
choices
we
make
about
war
can
impact
in
sometimes
unintended
ways
the
openness
and
freedom
on
which
our
way
of
life
depends
and
that
is
why
intend
to
engage
congress
about
the
existing
to
use
military
force
or
to
determine
how
we
can
continue
to
fight
terrorism
without
keeping
america
on
perpetual
wartime
footing
the
is
now
nearly
years
old
the
afghan
war
is
coming
to
an
end
core
is
shell
of
its
former
self
groups
like
must
be
dealt
with
but
in
the
years
to
come
not
every
collection
of
thugs
that
labels
themselves
will
pose
credible
threat
to
the
united
states
unless
we
discipline
our
thinking
our
definitions
our
actions
we
may
be
drawn
into
more
wars
we
need
to
fight
or
continue
to
grant
presidents
unbound
powers
more
suited
for
traditional
armed
conflicts
between
nation
states
so
look
forward
to
engaging
congress
and
the
american
people
in
efforts
to
refine
and
ultimately
repeal
the
mandate
and
will
not
sign
laws
designed
to
expand
this
mandate
further
our
systematic
effort
to
dismantle
terrorist
must
continue
but
this
war
like
all
wars
must
end
what
history
advises
what
our
democracy
demands
and
that
brings
me
to
my
final
topic
the
detention
of
terrorist
suspects
going
to
repeat
one
more
time
as
matter
of
policy
the
preference
of
the
united
states
is
to
capture
terrorist
suspects
when
we
do
detain
suspect
we
interrogate
them
and
if
the
suspect
can
be
prosecuted
we
decide
whether
to
try
him
in
civilian
court
or
military
commission
during
the
past
decade
the
vast
majority
of
those
detained
by
our
military
were
captured
on
the
battlefield
in
iraq
we
turned
over
thousands
of
prisoners
as
we
ended
the
war
in
we
have
detention
facilities
to
the
afghans
as
part
of
the
process
of
restoring
afghan
sovereignty
so
we
bring
law
of
war
detention
to
an
end
and
we
are
committed
to
prosecuting
terrorists
wherever
we
can
the
glaring
exception
to
this
approach
is
the
detention
at
bay
the
original
premise
for
opening
that
detainees
would
not
be
able
to
challenge
their
detention
was
found
unconstitutional
five
years
ago
in
the
meantime
has
become
symbol
around
the
world
for
an
america
that
flouts
the
rule
of
law
our
allies
cooperate
with
us
if
they
think
terrorist
will
end
up
at
during
time
of
budget
cuts
we
spend
million
each
year
to
imprison
people
almost
million
per
prisoner
and
the
department
of
estimates
that
we
must
spend
another
million
to
keep
open
at
time
when
cutting
investments
in
education
and
research
here
at
home
and
when
the
pentagon
is
struggling
with
and
budget
cuts
as
president
have
tried
to
close
transferred
detainees
to
other
countries
before
congress
imposed
restrictions
to
effectively
prevent
us
from
either
transferring
detainees
to
other
countries
or
imprisoning
them
here
in
the
united
states
these
restrictions
make
no
sense
after
all
under
president
bush
some
detainees
were
transferred
from
with
support
when
ran
for
president
the
first
time
john
supported
closing
this
was
bipartisan
issue
no
person
has
ever
escaped
one
of
our
or
military
prisons
here
in
the
united
states
ever
our
courts
have
convicted
hundreds
of
people
for
terrorism
or
including
some
folks
who
are
more
dangerous
than
most
detainees
they
in
our
prisons
and
given
my
relentless
pursuit
of
leadership
there
is
no
justification
beyond
politics
for
congress
to
prevent
us
from
closing
facility
that
should
have
never
have
been
opened
audience
member
excuse
me
president
president
so
let
me
finish
so
today
once
again
audience
member
there
are
people
on
hunger
strike
these
are
desperate
people
president
about
to
address
it
but
you
got
to
let
me
speak
about
to
address
it
audience
member
you
our
president
let
me
address
it
audience
member
you
an
close
bay
president
why
you
let
me
address
it
audience
member
still
prisoners
president
why
you
sit
down
and
will
tell
you
exactly
what
going
to
do
audience
member
that
includes
president
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
you
should
let
me
finish
my
sentence
today
once
again
call
on
congress
to
lift
the
restrictions
on
detainee
transfers
from
have
asked
the
department
of
to
designate
site
in
the
united
states
where
we
can
hold
military
commissions
appointing
new
senior
envoy
at
the
state
department
and
department
whose
sole
responsibility
will
be
to
achieve
the
transfer
of
detainees
to
third
countries
am
lifting
the
moratorium
on
detainee
transfers
to
yemen
so
we
can
review
them
on
basis
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
we
will
transfer
detainees
who
have
been
cleared
to
go
to
other
countries
audience
member
prisoners
already
release
them
today
president
where
appropriate
we
will
bring
terrorists
to
justice
in
our
courts
and
our
military
justice
system
and
we
will
insist
that
judicial
review
be
available
for
every
detainee
audience
member
it
needs
to
be
president
now
let
me
finish
let
me
finish
part
of
free
is
you
being
able
to
speak
but
also
you
listening
and
me
being
able
to
speak
now
even
after
we
take
these
steps
one
issue
will
remain
just
how
to
deal
with
those
detainees
who
we
know
have
participated
in
dangerous
plots
or
attacks
but
who
can
not
be
prosecuted
for
example
because
the
evidence
against
them
has
been
compromised
or
is
inadmissible
in
court
of
law
but
once
we
commit
to
process
of
closing
am
confident
that
this
legacy
problem
can
be
resolved
consistent
with
our
commitment
to
the
rule
of
law
know
the
politics
are
hard
but
history
will
cast
harsh
judgment
on
this
aspect
of
our
fight
against
terrorism
and
those
of
us
who
fail
to
end
it
imagine
future
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
when
the
united
states
of
america
is
still
holding
people
who
have
been
charged
with
no
crime
on
piece
of
land
that
is
not
part
of
our
country
look
at
the
current
situation
where
we
are
detainees
who
are
being
held
on
hunger
strike
willing
to
cut
the
young
lady
who
interrupted
me
some
slack
because
it
worth
being
passionate
about
is
this
who
we
are
is
that
something
our
founders
foresaw
is
that
the
america
we
want
to
leave
our
children
our
sense
of
justice
is
stronger
than
that
we
have
prosecuted
scores
of
terrorists
in
our
courts
that
includes
who
tried
to
blow
up
an
airplane
over
detroit
and
who
put
car
bomb
in
times
square
it
in
court
of
law
that
we
will
try
who
is
accused
of
bombing
the
boston
marathon
the
shoe
bomber
is
as
we
speak
serving
life
sentence
in
maximum
security
prison
here
in
the
united
states
in
sentencing
judge
young
told
him
way
we
treat
the
measure
of
our
own
audience
member
how
about
locking
up
is
that
the
way
we
treat
old
inaudible
can
you
take
the
drones
out
of
the
hands
of
the
can
you
stop
the
signature
strikes
killing
people
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
activities
president
addressing
that
audience
member
thousands
of
muslims
that
got
killed
will
you
compensate
the
innocent
families
that
will
make
us
safer
here
at
home
love
my
country
love
inaudible
president
think
that
and
going
off
script
as
you
might
expect
here
the
voice
of
that
woman
is
worth
paying
attention
to
obviously
do
not
agree
with
much
of
what
she
said
and
obviously
she
listening
to
me
in
much
of
what
said
but
these
are
tough
issues
and
the
suggestion
that
we
can
gloss
over
them
is
wrong
when
that
judge
sentenced
the
shoe
bomber
he
went
on
to
point
to
the
american
flag
that
flew
in
the
courtroom
flag
he
said
fly
there
long
after
this
is
all
forgotten
that
flag
still
stands
for
so
america
faced
down
dangers
far
greater
than
by
staying
true
to
the
values
of
our
founding
and
by
using
our
constitutional
compass
we
have
overcome
slavery
and
civil
war
and
fascism
and
communism
in
just
these
last
few
years
as
president
watched
the
american
people
bounce
back
from
painful
recession
mass
shootings
natural
disasters
like
the
recent
that
devastated
oklahoma
these
events
were
heartbreaking
they
shook
our
communities
to
the
core
but
because
of
the
resilience
of
the
american
people
these
events
could
not
come
close
to
breaking
us
think
of
manning
the
survivor
who
had
severe
burns
over
percent
of
her
body
who
said
my
reality
put
on
it
literally
and
move
think
of
the
new
yorkers
who
filled
times
square
the
day
after
an
attempted
car
bomb
as
if
nothing
had
happened
think
of
the
proud
parents
who
after
their
daughter
was
invited
to
the
white
house
wrote
to
us
have
raised
an
american
muslim
daughter
to
dream
big
and
never
give
up
because
it
does
pay
think
of
all
the
wounded
warriors
rebuilding
their
lives
and
helping
other
vets
to
find
jobs
think
of
the
runner
planning
to
do
the
boston
marathon
who
said
year
going
to
have
more
people
than
ever
determination
is
not
something
to
be
messed
who
the
american
people
are
determined
and
not
to
be
messed
with
and
now
we
need
strategy
and
politics
that
reflects
this
resilient
spirit
our
victory
against
terrorism
be
measured
in
surrender
ceremony
at
battleship
or
statue
being
pulled
to
the
ground
victory
will
be
measured
in
parents
taking
their
kids
to
school
immigrants
coming
to
our
shores
fans
taking
in
veteran
starting
business
bustling
city
street
citizen
shouting
her
concerns
at
president
the
quiet
determination
that
strength
of
character
and
bond
of
fellowship
that
refutation
of
fear
that
is
both
our
sword
and
our
shield
and
long
after
the
current
messengers
of
hate
have
faded
from
the
memory
alongside
the
brutal
despots
and
deranged
madmen
and
ruthless
demagogues
who
litter
history
the
flag
of
the
united
states
will
still
wave
from
cemeteries
to
national
monuments
to
distant
outposts
abroad
and
that
flag
will
still
stand
for
freedom
thank
you
very
everybody
god
bless
you
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
president
hello
thank
you
everybody

is
one
of
the
great
honors
of
my
life

gathering

to
thank
for
his
outstanding
leadership
and
the
board
of
trustees
we
have
congressman
and
bishop
both
proud
alumni
of
this
school
as
well
as
congressman

one
of
my

great
inspiration

us
all

have
your
outstanding
mayor
reed
in
the
house
to
all
the
members
of
the
family
and
most
of
all
congratulations
to
this
distinguished
group
of
men
the
class
of
have
to
say
that
little
hard
to
follow
not
but
skinny
guy
with
funny
name
going
to
be
doing
something
also
have
to
say
that
you
all
are
going
to
get
wet
and
be
out
there
with
you
if
could
but
secret
service
gets
nervous
so
going
to
have
to
stay
here
dry
but
know
that
there
with
you
in
spirit
some
of
you
are
graduating
summa
some
of
you
are
graduating
know
some
of
you
are
just
graduating
you
that
appropriate
because
sunday
see
some
moms
and
grandmas
here
aunts
in
their
sunday
best
although
they
are
upset
about
their
hair
getting
messed
up
would
not
be
sitting
in
the
rain
she
has
taught
me
about
hair
want
to
congratulate
all
of
you
the
parents
the
grandparents
the
brothers
and
sisters
the
family
and
friends
who
supported
these
young
men
in
so
many
ways
this
is
your
day
as
well
just
think
about
it
your
sons
your
brothers
your
nephews
they
spent
the
last
four
years
far
from
home
and
close
to
and
yet
they
are
still
here
today
so
done
something
right
graduates
give
big
round
of
applause
to
your
family
for
everything
that
done
for
you
know
that
some
of
you
had
to
wait
in
long
lines
to
get
into
ceremony
and
would
but
it
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
security
those
graduates
just
wanted
you
to
know
what
like
to
register
for
classes
here
and
this
time
of
year
brings
different
kind
of
stress
every
senior
stopping
by
hall
over
the
past
week
making
sure
your
name
was
actually
on
the
list
of
students
who
met
all
the
graduation
requirements
if
it
was
on
the
list
you
had
to
figure
out
why
was
it
that
library
book
you
lent
to
that
trifling
roommate
who
return
it
was
it
policy
class
did
you
get
enough
crown
forum
credits
on
that
last
point
going
to
exercise
my
power
as
president
to
declare
this
sufficient
crown
forum
credits
for
any
otherwise
eligible
student
to
graduate
that
is
my
graduation
gift
to
you
you
have
special
dispensation
now
graduates
am
humbled
to
stand
here
with
all
of
you
as
an
honorary
man
finally
made
it
and
as
do
mindful
of
an
old
saying
can
always
tell
man
but
you
tell
him
and
that
makes
my
task
little
more
difficult
suppose
but
think
it
also
reflects
the
sense
of
pride
always
been
part
of
this
tradition
benjamin
who
served
as
the
president
of
for
almost
years
understood
that
tradition
better
than
anybody
he
said
and
quote
will
not
be
sufficient
for
college
for
any
college
for
that
matter
to
produce
clever
but
rather
honest
men
men
who
can
be
trusted
in
public
and
private
life
men
who
are
sensitive
to
the
wrongs
the
sufferings
and
the
injustices
of
society
and
who
are
willing
to
accept
responsibility
for
correcting
those
it
was
that
mission
not
just
to
educate
men
but
to
cultivate
good
men
strong
men
upright
men
that
brought
community
leaders
together
just
two
years
after
the
end
of
the
civil
war
they
assembled
list
of
men
free
blacks
and
freed
slaves
who
would
make
up
the
first
prospective
class
of
what
later
became
college
most
of
those
first
students
had
desire
to
become
teachers
and
preachers
to
better
themselves
so
they
could
help
others
do
the
same
century
and
half
later
times
have
changed
but
the
still
endures
some
of
you
probably
came
here
from
communities
where
everybody
looked
like
you
others
may
have
come
here
in
search
of
community
and
suspect
that
some
of
you
probably
felt
little
bit
of
culture
shock
the
first
time
you
came
together
as
class
in
chapel
all
of
sudden
you
the
only
high
school
sports
captain
you
the
only
student
council
president
you
were
suddenly
in
group
of
high
achievers
and
that
meant
you
were
expected
to
do
something
more
the
unique
sense
of
purpose
that
this
place
has
always
infused
the
conviction
that
this
is
training
ground
not
only
for
individual
success
but
for
leadership
that
can
change
the
world
king
was
just
years
old
when
he
enrolled
here
at
he
was
an
unknown
undersized
unassuming
young
freshman
who
lived
at
home
with
his
parents
and
think
fair
to
say
he
the
coolest
kid
on
campus
for
the
suits
he
wore
his
classmates
called
him
but
his
education
at
helped
to
forge
the
intellect
the
discipline
the
compassion
the
soul
force
that
would
transform
america
it
was
here
that
he
was
introduced
to
the
writings
of
gandhi
and
and
the
theory
of
civil
disobedience
it
was
here
that
professors
encouraged
him
to
look
past
the
world
as
it
was
and
fight
for
the
world
as
it
should
be
and
it
was
here
at
as
king
later
wrote
where
that
not
even
of
some
bad
weather
added
on
that
part
know
wet
out
there
but
told
me
you
all
had
choice
and
decided
to
do
it
out
here
anyway
that
man
talking
now
think
about
it
for
black
men
in
the
and
the
the
threat
of
violence
the
constant
humiliations
large
and
small
the
uncertainty
that
you
could
support
family
the
gnawing
doubts
born
of
the
crow
culture
that
told
you
every
day
that
somehow
you
were
inferior
the
temptation
to
shrink
from
the
world
to
accept
your
place
to
avoid
risks
to
be
afraid
that
temptation
was
necessarily
strong
and
yet
here
under
the
tutelage
of
men
like
young
martin
learned
to
be
unafraid
and
he
in
turn
taught
others
to
be
unafraid
and
over
time
he
taught
nation
to
be
unafraid
and
over
the
last
years
thanks
to
the
moral
force
of
king
and
moses
generation
that
overcame
their
fear
and
their
cynicism
and
their
despair
barriers
have
come
tumbling
down
and
new
doors
of
opportunity
have
swung
open
and
laws
and
hearts
and
minds
have
been
changed
to
the
point
where
someone
who
looks
just
like
you
can
somehow
come
to
serve
as
president
of
these
united
states
of
america
so
the
history
we
share
should
give
you
hope
the
future
we
share
should
give
you
hope
graduating
into
an
improving
job
market
living
in
time
when
advances
in
technology
and
communication
put
the
world
at
your
fingertips
your
generation
is
uniquely
poised
for
success
unlike
any
generation
of
african
americans
that
came
before
it
but
that
mean
we
have
work
because
if
honest
with
ourselves
we
know
that
too
few
of
our
brothers
have
the
opportunities
that
had
here
at
in
troubled
all
across
this
country
many
of
them
heavily
african
american
too
few
of
our
citizens
have
role
models
to
guide
them
communities
just
couple
miles
from
my
house
in
chicago
communities
just
couple
miles
from
here
places
where
jobs
are
still
too
scarce
and
wages
are
still
too
low
where
schools
are
underfunded
and
violence
is
pervasive
where
too
many
of
our
men
spend
their
youth
not
behind
desk
in
classroom
but
hanging
out
on
the
streets
or
brooding
behind
jail
cell
my
job
as
president
is
to
advocate
for
policies
that
generate
more
opportunity
for
everybody
policies
that
strengthen
the
middle
class
and
give
more
people
the
chance
to
climb
their
way
into
the
middle
class
policies
that
create
more
good
jobs
and
reduce
poverty
and
educate
more
children
and
give
more
families
the
security
of
health
care
and
protect
more
of
our
children
from
the
horrors
of
gun
violence
that
my
job
those
are
matters
of
public
policy
and
it
is
important
for
all
of
us
black
white
and
brown
to
advocate
for
an
america
where
everybody
has
got
fair
shot
in
life
not
just
some
not
just
few
but
along
with
collective
responsibilities
we
have
individual
responsibilities
there
are
some
things
as
black
men
we
can
only
do
for
ourselves
there
are
some
things
as
men
that
you
are
obliged
to
do
for
those
still
left
behind
as
men
you
now
wield
something
even
more
powerful
than
the
diploma
about
to
collect
and
the
power
of
your
example
so
what
ask
of
you
today
is
the
same
thing
ask
of
every
graduating
class
address
use
that
power
for
something
larger
than
yourself
live
up
to
president
challenge
be
to
the
wrongs
the
sufferings
and
the
injustices
of
and
be
to
accept
responsibility
for
correcting
those
know
that
some
of
you
came
to
from
communities
where
life
was
about
keeping
your
head
down
and
looking
out
for
yourself
maybe
you
feel
like
you
escaped
and
now
you
can
take
your
degree
and
get
that
fancy
job
and
the
nice
house
and
the
nice
car
and
never
look
back
and
get
me
wrong
with
all
those
student
loans
had
to
take
out
know
got
to
earn
some
money
with
doors
open
to
you
that
your
parents
and
grandparents
could
not
even
imagine
no
one
expects
you
to
take
vow
of
poverty
but
will
say
it
betrays
poverty
of
ambition
if
all
you
think
about
is
what
goods
you
can
buy
instead
of
what
good
you
can
do
so
yes
go
get
that
law
degree
but
if
you
do
ask
yourself
if
the
only
option
is
to
defend
the
rich
and
the
powerful
or
if
you
can
also
find
some
time
to
defend
the
powerless
sure
go
get
your
or
start
that
business
we
need
black
businesses
out
there
but
ask
yourselves
what
broader
purpose
your
business
might
serve
in
putting
people
to
work
or
transforming
the
most
successful
know
start
out
intent
just
on
making
money
rather
they
had
vision
of
how
their
product
or
service
would
change
things
and
the
money
followed
some
of
you
may
be
headed
to
medical
school
to
become
doctors
but
make
sure
you
heal
folks
in
communities
who
really
need
it
too
for
generations
certain
groups
in
this
country
especially
african
americans
have
been
desperate
in
need
of
access
to
quality
affordable
health
care
and
as
society
finally
beginning
to
change
that
those
of
you
who
are
under
the
age
of
already
have
the
option
to
stay
on
your
health
care
plan
but
all
of
you
are
heading
into
an
economy
where
many
young
people
expect
not
only
to
have
multiple
jobs
but
multiple
careers
so
starting
october
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
otherwise
known
as
be
able
to
shop
for
quality
affordable
plan
yours
and
travels
with
you
plan
that
will
insure
not
only
your
health
but
your
dreams
if
you
are
sick
or
get
in
an
accident
but
we
going
to
need
some
doctors
to
make
sure
it
works
too
we
got
to
make
sure
everybody
has
good
health
in
this
country
not
just
good
for
you
good
for
this
country
so
you
going
to
have
to
spread
the
word
to
your
fellow
young
people
which
brings
me
to
second
point
just
as
has
taught
you
to
expect
more
of
yourselves
inspire
those
who
look
up
to
you
to
expect
more
of
themselves
we
know
that
too
many
young
men
in
our
community
continue
to
make
bad
choices
and
have
to
say
growing
up
made
quite
few
myself
sometimes
wrote
off
my
own
failings
as
just
another
example
of
the
world
trying
to
keep
black
man
down
had
tendency
sometimes
to
make
excuses
for
me
not
doing
the
right
thing
but
one
of
the
things
that
all
of
you
have
learned
over
the
last
four
years
is
no
longer
any
room
for
excuses
understand
common
fraternity
creed
here
at
are
tools
of
the
incompetent
used
to
build
bridges
to
nowhere
and
monuments
of
well
got
no
time
for
excuses
not
because
the
bitter
legacy
of
slavery
and
segregation
have
vanished
entirely
they
have
not
not
because
racism
and
discrimination
no
longer
exist
we
know
those
are
still
out
there
just
that
in
world
with
millions
of
young
people
from
china
and
india
and
brazil
many
of
whom
started
with
whole
lot
less
than
all
of
you
did
all
of
them
entering
the
global
workforce
alongside
you
nobody
is
going
to
give
you
anything
that
you
have
not
earned
nobody
cares
how
tough
your
upbringing
was
nobody
cares
if
you
suffered
some
discrimination
and
moreover
you
have
to
remember
that
whatever
gone
through
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
hardships
previous
generations
endured
and
they
overcame
them
and
if
they
overcame
them
you
can
overcome
them
too
you
now
hail
from
lineage
and
legacy
of
immeasurably
strong
men
men
who
bore
tremendous
burdens
and
still
laid
the
stones
for
the
path
on
which
we
now
walk
you
wear
the
mantle
of
and
washington
and
and
and
george
washington
carver
and
and
and
yes
martin
luther
king
these
men
were
many
things
to
many
people
and
they
knew
full
well
the
role
that
racism
played
in
their
lives
but
when
it
came
to
their
own
accomplishments
and
sense
of
purpose
they
had
no
time
for
excuses
every
one
of
you
have
grandma
or
an
uncle
or
parent
told
you
that
at
some
point
in
life
as
an
african
american
you
have
to
work
twice
as
hard
as
anyone
else
if
you
want
to
get
by
think
president
put
it
even
better
he
said
you
do
strive
to
do
it
so
well
that
no
man
living
and
no
man
dead
and
no
man
yet
to
be
born
can
do
it
any
and
promise
you
what
was
needed
in
time
that
spirit
of
excellence
and
hard
work
and
dedication
and
no
excuses
is
needed
now
more
than
ever
if
you
think
you
can
just
get
over
in
this
economy
just
because
you
have
degree
in
for
rude
awakening
but
if
you
stay
hungry
if
you
keep
hustling
if
you
keep
on
your
grind
and
get
other
folks
to
do
the
same
nobody
can
stop
you
and
when
talk
about
pursuing
excellence
and
setting
an
example
not
just
talking
about
in
your
professional
life
one
of
graduates
right
here
know
raining
but
going
to
tell
about
started
his
college
career
in
ohio
only
to
find
out
that
his
high
school
sweetheart
back
in
georgia
was
pregnant
so
he
came
back
and
enrolled
in
to
be
closer
to
her
pretty
soon
helping
raise
newborn
and
working
night
shifts
became
too
much
so
he
started
taking
business
classes
at
technical
college
instead
doing
everything
from
delivering
newspapers
to
buffing
hospital
floors
to
support
his
family
and
then
he
enrolled
at
second
time
but
even
with
job
he
keep
up
with
the
cost
of
tuition
so
after
getting
his
degree
from
that
technical
school
this
father
of
three
decided
to
come
back
to
for
third
time
as
says
has
plan
for
my
life
and
not
done
with
me
and
today
is
family
man
and
working
man
and
man
and
what
asking
all
of
you
to
do
keep
setting
an
example
for
what
it
means
to
be
man
be
the
best
husband
to
your
wife
or
your
boyfriend
or
your
partner
be
the
best
father
you
can
be
to
your
children
because
nothing
is
more
important
was
raised
by
heroic
single
mom
wonderful
grandparents
made
incredible
sacrifices
for
me
and
know
there
are
moms
and
grandparents
here
today
who
did
the
same
thing
for
all
of
you
but
sure
wish
had
had
father
who
was
not
only
present
but
involved
know
my
dad
and
so
my
whole
life
tried
to
be
for
and
my
girls
what
my
father
was
not
for
my
mother
and
me
want
to
break
that
cycle
where
father
is
not
at
home
where
father
is
not
helping
to
raise
that
son
or
daughter
want
to
be
better
father
better
husband
better
man
hard
work
that
demands
your
constant
attention
and
frequent
sacrifice
and
promise
you
will
tell
you
not
perfect
got
long
list
of
my
imperfections
even
now
still
still
learning
still
getting
corrected
in
terms
of
how
to
be
fine
husband
and
good
father
but
will
tell
you
this
everything
else
is
unfulfilled
if
we
fail
at
family
if
we
fail
at
that
responsibility
know
that
when
am
on
my
deathbed
someday
will
not
be
thinking
about
any
particular
legislation
passed
will
not
be
thinking
about
policy
promoted
will
not
be
thinking
about
the
gave
will
not
be
thinking
the
prize
received
will
be
thinking
about
that
walk
took
with
my
daughters
be
thinking
about
lazy
afternoon
with
my
wife
be
thinking
about
sitting
around
the
dinner
table
and
seeing
them
happy
and
healthy
and
knowing
that
they
were
loved
and
be
thinking
about
whether
did
right
by
all
of
them
so
be
good
role
model
set
good
example
for
that
young
brother
coming
up
if
you
know
somebody
not
on
point
go
back
and
bring
that
brother
along
those
been
left
behind
who
had
the
same
opportunities
we
have
they
need
to
hear
from
you
got
to
be
engaged
on
the
on
the
basketball
court
at
church
spend
time
and
energy
and
presence
to
give
people
opportunities
and
chance
pull
them
up
expose
them
support
their
dreams
do
put
them
down
got
to
teach
them
just
like
what
we
have
to
learn
what
it
means
to
be
man
to
serve
your
city
like
to
shape
the
culture
like
spike
lee
to
be
like
chester
one
of
the
first
people
to
integrate
the
university
of
georgia
law
school
when
he
got
there
nobody
would
sit
next
to
him
in
class
but
chester
mind
later
on
he
said
was
the
thing
for
me
to
do
someone
needed
to
be
the
and
today
chester
is
here
celebrating
his
reunion
where
is
chester
here
so
if
had
role
models
fathers
brothers
like
that
thank
them
today
and
if
you
commit
yourself
to
being
that
man
to
somebody
else
and
finally
as
you
do
these
things
do
them
not
just
for
yourself
but
do
even
do
them
just
for
the
african
american
community
want
you
to
set
your
sights
higher
at
the
turn
of
the
last
century
spoke
about
the
class
of
highly
educated
socially
conscious
leaders
in
the
black
community
but
not
just
the
african
american
community
that
needs
you
the
country
needs
you
the
world
needs
you
as
men
many
of
you
know
what
like
to
be
an
outsider
know
what
like
to
be
know
what
like
to
feel
the
sting
of
discrimination
and
an
experience
that
lot
of
americans
share
hispanic
americans
know
that
feeling
when
somebody
asks
them
where
they
come
from
or
tell
them
to
go
back
gay
and
lesbian
americans
feel
it
when
stranger
passes
judgment
on
their
parenting
skills
or
the
love
that
they
share
muslim
americans
feel
it
when
stared
at
with
suspicion
because
of
their
faith
any
woman
who
knows
the
injustice
of
earning
less
pay
for
doing
the
same
work
she
knows
what
like
to
be
on
the
outside
looking
in
so
your
experiences
give
you
special
insight
that
leaders
need
if
you
tap
into
that
experience
it
should
endow
you
with
empathy
the
understanding
of
what
like
to
walk
in
somebody
shoes
to
see
through
their
eyes
to
know
what
like
when
you
not
born
on
base
thinking
you
hit
triple
it
should
give
you
the
ability
to
connect
it
should
give
you
sense
of
compassion
and
what
it
means
to
overcome
barriers
and
will
tell
you
class
of
whatever
success
have
achieved
whatever
positions
of
leadership
have
held
have
depended
less
on
ivy
league
degrees
or
sat
scores
or
and
have
instead
been
due
to
that
sense
of
connection
and
empathy
the
special
obligation
felt
as
black
man
like
you
to
help
those
who
need
it
most
people
who
have
the
opportunities
that
had
because
there
but
for
the
grace
of
god
go
might
have
been
in
their
shoes
might
have
been
in
prison
might
have
been
unemployed
might
not
have
been
able
to
support
family
and
that
motivates
me
so
up
to
you
to
widen
your
circle
of
concern
to
care
about
justice
for
everybody
white
black
and
brown
everybody
not
just
in
your
own
community
but
also
across
this
country
and
around
the
world
to
make
sure
everyone
has
voice
and
everybody
gets
seat
at
the
table
that
everybody
no
matter
what
you
look
like
or
where
you
come
from
what
your
last
name
is
it
matter
everybody
gets
chance
to
walk
through
those
doors
of
opportunity
if
they
are
willing
to
work
hard
enough
when
was
four
years
old
stand
up
when
was
four
years
old
social
services
took
him
away
from
his
mama
put
him
in
the
care
of
his
grandparents
by
age
he
was
in
the
foster
care
system
three
years
after
that
enrolled
in
and
today
he
is
graduating
beta
on
his
way
to
harvard
law
school
but
not
stopping
there
as
member
of
the
national
foster
care
youth
and
alumni
policy
council
he
plans
to
use
his
law
degree
to
make
sure
kids
like
him
fall
through
the
cracks
and
it
matter
whether
black
kids
or
brown
kids
or
white
kids
or
native
american
kids
because
understand
what
going
through
and
he
be
fighting
for

everybody
just
finished
speaking
with
secretary
and
senior
officials
at
the
treasury
department
to
discuss
the
investigation
into
personnel
who
improperly
screened
conservative
groups
applying
for
status
and
look
forward
to
taking
some
questions
at
press
conference
but
today
wanted
to
make
sure
to
get
out
to
all
of
you
some
information
about
what
doing
about
this
and
where
we
go
from
here
reviewed
the
treasury
department
report
and
the
misconduct
that
it
uncovered
is
inexcusable
inexcusable
and
americans
are
right
to
be
angry
about
it
and
am
angry
about
it
will
not
tolerate
this
kind
of
in
any
agency
but
especially
in
the
given
the
power
that
it
has
and
the
reach
that
it
has
into
all
of
our
lives
and
as
said
earlier
it
should
not
matter
what
political
stripe
from
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
is
that
the
has
to
operate
with
absolute
integrity
the
government
generally
has
to
conduct
itself
in
way
that
is
true
to
the
public
trust
especially
true
for
the
so
what
going
to
do
first
going
to
hold
the
responsible
parties
accountable
yesterday
directed
secretary
to
follow
up
on
the
audit
to
see
how
this
happened
and
who
is
responsible
and
to
make
sure
that
we
understand
all
the
facts
today
secretary
took
the
first
step
by
requesting
and
accepting
the
resignation
of
the
acting
commissioner
of
the
because
given
the
controversy
surrounding
this
audit
important
to
institute
new
leadership
that
can
help
restore
confidence
going
forward
second
going
to
put
in
place
new
safeguards
to
make
sure
this
kind
of
can
not
happen
again
and
directed
secretary
to
ensure
the
begins
implementing
the
recommendations
right
away
third
we
will
work
with
congress
as
it
performs
its
oversight
role
and
our
administration
has
to
make
sure
that
we
are
working
hand
in
hand
with
congress
to
get
this
thing
fixed
congress
democrats
and
republicans
owe
it
to
the
american
people
to
treat
that
authority
with
the
responsibility
it
deserves
and
in
way
that
smack
of
politics
or
partisan
agendas
because
think
one
thing
that
seen
is
across
the
board
everybody
believes
what
happened
in
as
reported
in
the
report
is
an
outrage
the
good
news
is
fixable
and
in
best
interest
to
work
together
to
fix
it
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
sure
nothing
like
this
happens
again
by
holding
the
responsible
parties
accountable
by
putting
in
place
new
checks
and
new
safeguards
and
going
forward
by
making
sure
that
the
law
is
applied
as
it
should
be
in
fair
and
impartial
way
and
going
to
have
to
make
sure
that
the
laws
are
clear
so
that
we
can
have
confidence
that
they
are
enforced
in
fair
and
impartial
way
and
that
there
is
not
too
much
ambiguity
surrounding
these
laws
so
what
expect
what
the
american
people
deserve
and
what
going
to
do
thank
you

city
one
of
the
great
cities
placer
and
fitting
that
we
gather
at
this
great
museum
which
celebrates
ancient
and
their
achievements
in
arts
and
architecture
medicine
and
mathematics
in
modern
times
blend
of
cultures
and
traditions
found
its
expression
in
the
murals
of
and
the
paintings
of
and
the
poetry
of
and
the
essays
of
and
once
spoke
words
that
capture
the
spirit
of
our
gathering
here
today
in
this
place
that
celebrates
your
past
but
which
this
morning
is
filled
with
so
many
young
people
who
will
shape
future
said
is
not
outside
us
it
is
within
us
it
is
today
and
the
most
ancient
antiquity
it
is
tomorrow
and
the
beginning
of
the
world
it
is
thousand
years
old
and
yet
and
why
wanted
this
opportunity
to
speak
with
all
of
you
today
because
you
live
at
the
intersection
of
history
that
was
referring
to
the
young
people
of
mexico
you
your
heritage
thousands
of
years
old
but
also
part
of
something
new
nation
in
the
process
of
remaking
itself
and
as
our
modern
world
changes
around
us
the
spirit
of
young
people
your
optimism
and
your
idealism
and
your
willingness
to
discard
old
habits
that
are
no
longer
working
that
will
drive
the
world
forward
you
see
the
difference
between
the
world
as
it
is
and
the
world
as
it
could
to
be
between
old
attitudes
that
stifle
progress
and
the
new
thinking
that
allows
us
to
connect
and
collaborate
across
cultures
and
by
the
way
that
includes
how
we
think
about
the
relationship
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
despite
all
the
bonds
and
the
values
that
we
share
despite
all
the
people
who
claim
heritage
on
both
sides
our
attitudes
sometimes
are
trapped
in
old
stereotypes
some
americans
only
see
the
mexico
that
is
depicted
in
sensational
headlines
of
violence
and
border
crossings
and
admit
it
some
mexicans
think
that
america
disrespects
mexico
or
thinks
that
america
is
trying
to
impose
itself
on
mexican
sovereignty
or
just
wants
to
wall
ourselves
off
and
in
both
countries
such
distortions
create
misunderstandings
that
make
it
harder
for
us
to
move
forward
together
so
come
to
mexico
because
think
time
for
us
to
put
the
old
aside
time
to
new
realities
including
the
impressive
progress
of
mexico
it
is
true
that
there
are
mexicans
all
across
this
country
who
are
making
courageous
sacrifices
for
the
security
of
your
country
that
in
the
countryside
and
the
not
far
from
here
there
are
those
who
are
still
struggling
to
give
their
children
better
life
but
also
clear
is
that
new
mexico
is
emerging
see
it
in
the
deepening
of
democracy
citizens
who
are
standing
up
and
saying
that
violence
and
impunity
is
not
acceptable
courageous
press
working
to
hold
leaders
accountable
robust
civil
society
including
brave
defenders
of
human
rights
who
demand
dignity
and
rule
of
law
you
have
political
parties
that
are
competing
vigorously
but
also
transferring
power
peacefully
and
forging
compromise
and
that
all
sign
of
the
extraordinary
progress
that
taken
place
here
in
mexico
and
even
though
we
know
the
work
of
perfecting
democracy
is
never
finished
that
true
in
america
that
true
here
in
mexico
you
go
forward
knowing
the
truth
that
once
spoke
is
the
destiny
of
and
we
are
seeing
that
here
in
mexico
we
seeing
that
here
in
mexico
we
also
seeing
mexico
creating
new
prosperity
trading
with
the
world
becoming
manufacturing
powerhouse
from
to
to
and
across
the
central
highlands
global
leader
in
and
appliances
and
electronics
but
also
of
innovation
producing
the
software
and
the
hardware
of
our
digital
age
one
man
in
spoke
for
an
increasing
number
of
mexicans
no
reason
to
go
abroad
in
search
of
better
life
there
are
good
opportunities
that
what
he
said
and
you
are
an
example
of
that
and
in
fact
see
mexico
lifted
millions
of
people
from
poverty
because
of
the
sacrifices
of
generations
majority
of
mexicans
now
call
themselves
middle
class
with
quality
of
life
that
your
parents
and
grandparents
could
only
dream
of
this
includes
by
the
way
opportunities
for
women
who
are
proving
that
when
you
give
women
chance
they
will
shape
our
destiny
just
as
well
as
men
if
not
better
also
see
in
youth
an
empowered
generation
because
of
technology
think
see
some
of
you
right
now
happening
and
whether
harnessing
social
media
to
preserve
indigenous
languages
or
speaking
up
for
the
future
that
you
want
making
it
clear
that
you
want
your
voice
heard
and
because
of
all
the
dynamic
progress
that
taking
place
here
in
mexico
mexico
is
also
taking
its
rightful
place
in
the
world
on
the
world
stage
mexico
is
standing
up
for
democracy
not
just
here
in
mexico
but
throughout
the
hemisphere
mexico
is
sharing
expertise
with
across
the
when
they
face
earthquakes
or
threats
to
their
citizens
or
go
to
the
polls
to
cast
their
votes
mexico
is
there
helping
its
mexico
has
joined
the
ranks
of
the
largest
economies
it
became
the
first
latin
american
nation
to
host
the
just
as
mexico
is
being
transformed
so
are
the
ties
between
our
two
countries
as
president
been
guided
by
basic
proposition
in
this
relationship
no
senior
partner
or
junior
partner
we
are
two
equal
partners
two
sovereign
nations
we
must
work
together
in
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
and
if
we
do
that
both
mexico
and
the
united
states
will
prosper
and
just
as
worked
with
president
reaffirmed
with
president
that
the
great
partnership
between
our
two
countries
will
not
simply
continue
going
to
grow
stronger
and
become
broader
in
my
time
with
president
come
to
see
his
deep
commitment
to
mexico
and
its
future
and
we
share
the
belief
that
as
leaders
our
guiding
mission
is
to
improve
the
lives
of
our
people
and
so
we
agree
that
the
relationship
between
our
nations
must
be
defined
not
by
the
threats
that
we
face
but
by
the
prosperity
and
the
opportunity
that
we
can
create
together
now
as
equal
partners
both
our
nations
must
our
mutual
responsibilities
so
here
in
mexico
embarked
on
an
ambitious
reform
agenda
to
make
your
economy
more
competitive
and
your
institutions
more
accountable
to
you
the
mexican
people
as
you
pursue
these
reforms
want
you
to
know
that
you
have
strong
support
in
the
united
states
because
we
believe
believe
that
people
all
around
the
world
deserve
the
best
from
their
government
and
whether
looking
for
basic
services
or
trying
to
start
new
business
we
share
your
belief
that
you
should
be
able
to
make
it
through
your
day
without
paying
bribe
and
when
talented
mexicans
like
you
imagine
your
future
you
should
have
every
opportunity
to
succeed
right
here
in
the
country
you
love
and
in
the
united
states
we
our
responsibilities
we
understand
that
much
of
the
root
cause
of
violence
that
been
happening
here
in
mexico
for
which
many
so
mexicans
have
suffered
is
the
demand
for
illegal
drugs
in
the
united
states
and
so
got
to
continue
to
make
progress
on
that
front
been
asked
and
honestly
do
not
believe
that
drugs
is
the
answer
but
do
believe
that
comprehensive
approach
not
just
law
enforcement
but
education
and
prevention
and
treatment
that
what
we
have
to
do
and
going
to
stay
at
it
because
the
lives
of
our
children
and
the
future
of
our
nations
depend
on
it
and
we
also
that
most
of
the
guns
used
to
commit
violence
here
in
mexico
come
from
the
united
states
think
many
of
you
know
that
in
america
our
constitution
guarantees
our
individual
right
to
bear
arms
and
as
president
swore
an
oath
to
uphold
that
right
and
always
will
but
at
the
same
time
as
said
in
the
united
states
will
continue
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
pass
reforms
that
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
and
dangerous
people
that
can
save
lives
here
in
mexico
and
back
home
in
the
united
states
the
right
thing
to
do
so
keep
increasing
the
pressure
on
gun
traffickers
who
bring
illegal
guns
into
mexico
keep
putting
these
criminals
where
they
belong
behind
bars
we
got
work
to
do
on
security
issues
but
we
also
our
responsibility
as
nation
that
believes
that
all
people
are
created
equal
we
believe
our
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
we
treat
one
another
with
dignity
and
respect
and
this
includes
how
the
united
states
has
been
strengthened
by
the
extraordinary
contributions
of
immigrants
from
mexico
and
by
americans
of
mexican
heritage
mexican
americans
enrich
our
communities
including
my
of
chicago
where
you
can
walk
through
like
little
village
dotted
with
murals
of
mexican
patriots
you
can
stop
at
you
can
hear
some
where
we
are
inspired
by
the
deep
faith
of
our
peoples
at
churches
like
our
lady
of
got
in
here
somewhere
and
so
grateful
to
mexican
americans
in
every
segment
of
our
society
for
teaching
our
children
and
running
our
companies
and
serving
with
in
our
military
and
making
breakthroughs
in
science
standing
up
for
social
justice
as
martin
luther
king
told
once
we
are
in
the
fight
for
and
in
fact
without
the
strong
support
of
including
so
many
mexican
americans
would
not
be
standing
today
as
president
of
the
united
states
that
the
truth
and
so
given
that
is
heritage
given
that
we
share
border
with
mexico
given
ties
that
run
back
generations
it
is
critical
that
the
united
states
the
need
to
reform
our
immigration
system
because
we
are
nation
of
laws
but
we
also
nation
of
immigrants
like
every
nation
we
have
responsibility
to
ensure
that
our
laws
are
upheld
but
we
also
know
that
as
nation
of
immigrants
the
immigration
system
we
have
in
the
united
states
right
now
reflect
our
values
it
separates
families
when
we
should
be
reuniting
them
led
to
millions
of
people
to
live
in
the
shadows
it
deprives
us
of
the
talents
of
so
many
young
people
even
though
we
know
that
immigrants
have
always
been
the
engine
of
our
economy
starting
some
of
our
greatest
companies
and
pioneering
new
industries
one
of
the
reasons
acted
to
lift
the
shadow
of
deportation
from
what
we
call
the
dreamers
young
people
brought
to
the
united
states
as
children
and
why
working
with
our
congress
to
pass
immigration
reform
this
year
convinced
we
can
get
it
done
reform
that
continues
to
strengthen
border
security
and
strengthen
legal
immigration
so
citizens
have
to
wait
years
to
bring
their
families
to
the
united
states
reform
that
holds
everyone
accountable
so
immigrants
get
on
the
right
side
of
the
law
and
so
immigrants
are
not
exploited
and
abused
and
most
of
all
reform
that
gives
millions
of
undocumented
individuals
pathway
to
earn
their
citizenship
and
optimistic
that
after
years
of
trying
we
are
going
to
get
it
done
this
year
absolutely
convinced
of
it
obviously
going
to
have
to
work
with
the
mexican
government
to
make
sure
that
we
got
border
but
also
want
to
work
with
the
mexican
government
because
believe
that
the
solution
to
the
challenge
of
illegal
immigration
is
growing
and
prosperous
mexico
that
creates
more
jobs
and
opportunities
for
young
people
here
agree
with
the
mexican
student
who
said
feel
like
we
can
reach
the
same
level
as
anyone
in
the
that
absolutely
true
and
so
firmly
believe
together
we
can
achieve
more
so
with
the
remainder
of
my
time
today
want
to
focus
on
five
areas
where
we
can
do
more
number
one
do
more
to
expand
trade
and
commerce
that
creates
good
jobs
for
our
people
we
already
buy
more
of
your
exports
than
any
country
in
the
world
we
sell
more
of
our
exports
to
mexico
than
we
do
to
brazil
russia
india
and
china
combined
mexican
companies
are
investing
more
in
the
united
states
and
the
largest
foreign
investor
in
mexico
because
we
believe
in
mexico
and
want
to
be
partner
in
your
success
so
guided
by
the
new
economic
dialogue
that
president
and
announced
yesterday
do
more
to
unlock
the
true
potential
of
our
relationship
keep
investing
in
our
roads
and
our
bridges
and
our
border
crossings
so
we
can
trade
faster
and
cheaper
help
our
smaller
businesses
which
employ
most
of
our
workers
access
new
markets
and
new
capital
the
big
markets
right
across
the
border
empower
our
young
entrepreneurs
as
they
create
startup
companies
that
can
transform
how
we
live
and
the
partnership
this
year
so
our
two
nations
can
compete
and
win
in
the
markets
of
the
asia
pacific
if
the
united
states
and
mexico
are
working
together
we
can
sell
whole
lot
of
things
on
the
other
side
of
the
pacific
ocean
where
the
economies
are
taking
off
right
now
that
number
one
number
two
not
just
sell
more
things
to
each
other
build
more
things
together
with
many
of
our
companies
operating
in
both
countries
parts
are
now
being
shipped
back
and
forth
across
the
border
as
assembled
so
every
day
and
mexican
workers
are
building
things
together
whether
crafts
or
whether
cars
or
aircraft
or
computers
or
satellites
think
this
is
only
the
beginning
given
the
skills
of
our
workers
it
makes
even
more
sense
for
companies
around
the
world
to
set
up
shop
in
the
united
states
and
set
up
shop
in
mexico
and
as
mexico
reforms
going
to
be
able
to
do
more
business
together
and
sell
more
goods
around
the
world
and
the
more
that
our
companies
collaborate
the
more
competitive
be
and
the
entire
hemisphere
will
benefit
because
of
those
links
and
chains
that
have
been
created
between
our
two
countries
number
three
as
we
secure
our
economic
future
secure
our
energy
future
including
the
clean
energy
that
we
need
to
combat
climate
change
our
nations
are
blessed
with
boundless
natural
beauty
from
our
coastlines
and
to
your
tropical
forests
but
climate
change
is
happening
the
science
is
undeniable
and
so
is
the
fact
that
our
economies
must
become
greener
in
the
united
states
made
historic
commitments
to
clean
and
renewable
energy
like
solar
and
wind
power
we
made
commitment
to
reduce
the
emissions
of
harmful
carbon
pollution
and
here
in
mexico
leader
in
cutting
carbon
emissions
and
helping
developing
countries
do
the
same
so
together
keep
building
new
energy
partnerships
by
harnessing
all
these
new
sources
and
by
the
way
creating
the
good
jobs
that
come
with
these
new
technologies
and
keep
investing
in
green
buildings
and
technologies
that
make
our
entire
economy
more
efficient
but
also
make
our
planet
cleaner
and
safer
for
future
generations
number
four
and
this
is
part
of
staying
competitive
do
more
together
in
education
so
our
young
people
have
the
knowledge
and
skills
to
succeed
here
in
mexico
made
important
progress
with
more
children
staying
in
school
longer
and
record
numbers
of
students
like
you
getting
university
education
just
imagine
how
much
the
students
of
our
two
countries
could
do
together
how
much
we
could
learn
from
each
other
and
why
president
and
announced
new
partnership
in
higher
education
to
encourage
more
collaboration
between
our
universities
and
our
university
students
going
to
focus
on
science
and
technology
on
engineering
and
mathematics
and
this
is
part
of
my
broader
initiative
called
strong
in
the
we
want
students
from
the
united
states
studying
in
latin
america
including
mexico
and
we
want
latin
american
students
including
mexican
students
to
come
to
study
in
the
united
states
of
america
because
when
we
study
together
and
we
learn
together
we
work
together
and
we
prosper
together
that
what
believe
and
finally
to
help
spark
prosperity
in
both
out
countries
truly
invest
in
innovation
and
research
and
development
together
here
in
mexico
now
global
leader
in
graduating
engineers
and
technicians
one
of
leading
scientists
is
helping
data
from
the
rover
that
we
landed
on
mars
so
together
remember
that
every
dollar
every
that
we
invest
in
research
and
development
returns
so
much
more
to
our
economies
in
jobs
and
opportunity
new
products
new
services
that
why
calling
for
us
to
forge
new
partnerships
in
aerospace
and
it
and
nanotechnology
and
biotechnology
and
robotics
answer
the
hope
of
young
woman
student
at
the
national
polytechnic
institute
who
spoke
for
many
in
your
generation
so
eager
to
make
your
mark
she
said
us
jobs
as
give
us
jobs
as
creators
sometimes
young
people
are
known
as
just
consumers
of
goods
but
we
want
young
people
creating
the
new
products
the
next
big
thing
that
will
change
how
we
live
our
lives
that
the
agenda
that
want
to
pursue
and
understand
that
there
are
those
both
here
in
mexico
and
elsewhere
in
latin
america
but
also
back
home
in
the
united
states
who
are
of
your
progress
who
maybe
doubt
the
capacity
for
us
to
make
the
most
of
this
moment
there
are
always
cynics
who
say
this
is
too
hard
the
headwinds
you
face
are
too
stiff
they
say
mexico
has
been
here
before
we
look
like
we
making
progress
we
looking
at
bright
horizon
on
the
verge
of
great
possibility
but
then
we
get
blown
off
course
and
true
that
nothing
is
inevitable
progress
and
success
is
never
guaranteed
the
future
that
you
dream
of
the
mexico
you
imagine
it
must
be
built
it
must
be
earned
nobody
else
can
do
it
for
you
only
you
can
earn
it
you
are
the
future
as
wrote
in
you
are
the
dream
for
just
as
it
was
patriots
who
answered
the
call
when
father
rang
the
church
bell
two
centuries
ago
you
your
lives
in
free
mexico
are
the
dream
that
they
imagined
and
now
it
falls
to
you
to
keep
alive
those
virtues
for
which
so
many
generations
of
mexicans
struggled
you
are
the
dream
that
can
stand
up
for
justice
and
human
rights
and
human
dignity
here
at
home
and
around
the
world
the
creators
and
the
builders
and
the
climbers
and
the
who
can
deliver
progress
and
prosperity
that
will
lift
up
not
just
the
mexican
people
for
generations
to
come
but
the
entire
world
the
men
and
women
who
will
push
this
nation
upwards
as
mexico
assumes
its
rightful
place
as
you
proudly
sing
heaven
your
eternal
destiny
was
written
by
the
finger
of
you
are
the
dream
this
is
your
moment
and
as
you
reach
for
the
future
always
remember
that
you
have
the
greatest
of
partners
the
greatest
if
friends
the
nation
that
is
rooting
for
your
success
more
than
anybody
else
your
the
united
states
of
america
viva
viva
thank
you
very
much
thank
you
thank
you
everybody
how
do
you
like
my
new
entrance
music
rush
warned
you
about
this
second
term
baby
changing
things
around
here
little
bit
actually
my
were
little
worried
about
the
new
rap
entrance
music
they
are
little
more
traditional
they
suggested
that
should
start
with
some
jokes
at
my
own
expense
just
take
myself
down
peg
was
like
guys
after
four
and
half
years
how
many
pegs
are
there
left
want
to
thank
the
white
house
correspondents
doing
an
outstanding
job
we
are
grateful
for
the
great
work
done
to
all
the
dignitaries
who
are
here
everybody
on
the
dais
especially
want
to
say
thank
you
to
general
ray
who
does
outstanding
service
on
behalf
of
our
country
and
all
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
every
single
day
and
of
course
our
extraordinary
first
lady
everybody
loves
on
the
cover
of
vogue
high
poll
numbers
but
worry
recently
got
my
own
magazine
cover
now
look
get
it
these
days
look
in
the
mirror
and
have
to
admit
not
the
strapping
young
muslim
socialist
that
used
to
be
time
passes
you
get
little
and
yet
even
after
all
this
time
still
make
mistakes
like
out
in
california
at
fundraiser
having
nice
time
happen
to
mention
that
is
the
attorney
general
in
the
country
as
you
might
imagine
got
trouble
when
got
back
home
who
knew
holder
was
so
sensitive
and
then
the
easter
egg
roll
which
is
supposed
to
be
just
nice
fun
event
with
the
kids
go
out
on
the
basketball
court
took
shots
made
two
of
them
right
two
hits
misses
the
executives
at
asked
your
secret
so
yes
maybe
have
lost
step
but
some
things
are
beyond
my
control
for
example
this
whole
controversy
about
going
to
cuba
unbelievable
got
problems
and
now
is
one
another
rap
reference
bill
let
you
know
of
course
everybody
has
got
plenty
of
advice
said
could
solve
all
my
problems
if
were
just
more
like
in
american
and
know
is
here
tonight
your
secret
man
could
it
be
that
you
were
an
actor
in
an
aaron
liberal
might
that
have
something
to
do
with
it
know
check
in
with
me
maybe
something
else
anyway
that
this
job
can
take
toll
on
you
understand
second
term
you
need
burst
of
new
energy
try
some
new
things
and
my
team
and
talked
about
it
we
were
willing
to
try
anything
so
we
borrowed
one
of
tricks
thought
this
looked
pretty
good
but
no
bounce
want
to
give
to
our
was
just
talking
to
and
understand
that
when
the
association
was
considering
for
this
gig
they
were
faced
with
that
dilemma
do
you
offer
it
to
him
now
or
wait
for
five
years
and
then
give
it
to
jimmy
that
was
little
harsh
love
and
of
course
the
white
house
press
corps
is
here
know
has
taken
some
knocks
lately
but
the
fact
is
admire
their
commitment
to
cover
all
sides
of
story
just
in
case
one
of
them
happens
to
be
accurate
some
of
my
former
have
switched
over
to
the
dark
side
for
example
david
now
works
for
which
is
nice
change
of
pace
since
used
to
work
for
david
the
history
channel
is
not
here
guess
they
were
embarrassed
about
the
whole
thing
of
course
that
never
kept
fox
news
from
showing
up
they
actually
thought
the
comparison
was
not
fair
to
satan
but
the
problem
is
is
that
the
media
landscape
is
changing
so
rapidly
you
keep
up
with
it
mean
remember
when
was
just
something
did
in
college
around
true
recently
though
found
new
source
for
political
news
these
guys
are
great
think
everybody
here
should
check
it
out
they
tell
it
like
it
is
called
can
not
get
enough
of
it
the
fact
is
really
do
respect
the
press
that
the
press
and
have
different
jobs
to
do
my
job
is
to
be
president
your
job
is
to
keep
me
humble
frankly
think
doing
my
job
better
but
part
of
the
problem
is
everybody
is
so
cynical
mean
constantly
feeding
cynicism
suspicion
conspiracies
you
remember
few
months
ago
my
administration
put
out
photograph
of
me
going
shooting
at
camp
david
you
remember
that
and
quite
number
of
people
insisted
that
this
had
been
but
tonight
have
something
to
confess
you
were
right
guys
can
we
show
them
the
actual
photo
we
were
just
trying
to
tone
it
down
little
bit
that
was
an
awesome
day
there
are
other
new
players
in
the
media
landscape
as
well
like
super
did
you
know
that
spent
million
dollars
of
his
own
money
last
year
on
negative
got
to
really
dislike
me
to
spend
that
kind
of
money
mean
money
you
could
buy
an
island
and
call
it
for
that
kind
of
money
would
have
been
better
off
offering
me
million
dollar
to
drop
out
of
the
race
probably
have
taken
it
but
have
thought
about
it
would
have
taken
it
you
think
joking
know
republicans
are
still
sorting
out
what
happened
in
but
one
thing
they
all
agree
on
is
they
need
to
do
better
job
reaching
out
to
minorities
and
look
call
me
but
can
think
of
one
minority
they
could
start
with
hello
think
of
me
as
trial
run
you
know
see
how
it
goes
if
they
come
to
me
will
come
to
them
recently
had
dinner
been
well
had
dinner
with
number
of
the
republican
senators
and
admit
it
easy
proposed
toast
it
died
in
committee
of
course
even
after
done
all
this
some
folks
still
think
spend
enough
time
with
congress
why
you
get
drink
with
they
ask
really
why
you
get
drink
with
sorry
get
frustrated
sometimes
am
not
giving
up
in
fact
taking
my
charm
offensive
on
the
road
texas
with
ted
kentucky
concert
with
rand
paul
and
with
my
charm
offensive
has
helped
me
learn
some
interesting
things
about
what
going
on
in
congress
it
turns
out
absolutely
nothing
but
the
point
of
my
charm
offensive
is
simple
we
need
to
make
progress
on
some
important
issues
take
the
republicans
fell
in
love
with
this
thing
and
now
they
stop
talking
about
how
much
they
hate
it
it
like
we
trapped
in
taylor
swift
album
one
senator
who
has
reached
across
the
aisle
recently
is
but
know
about
mean
the
guy
has
not
even
finished
single
term
in
the
senate
and
he
thinks
he
ready
to
be
president
kids
these
days
on
the
other
hand
have
run
my
last
campaign
on
thursday
as
mentioned
went
to
the
opening
of
the
bush
presidential
library
in
dallas
it
was
wonderful
event
and
that
inspired
me
to
get
started
on
my
own
legacy
which
will
actually
begin
by
building
another
edifice
right
next
to
the
bush
library
can
we
show
that
please
also
hard
at
work
on
plans
for
the
library
and
some
have
suggested
that
we
put
it
in
my
birthplace
but
rather
keep
it
in
the
united
states
did
anybody
not
see
that
joke
coming
show
of
hands
only
maybe
now
speaking
of
presidents
and
their
legacies
want
to
acknowledge
wonderful
friend
and
daniel
who
are
here
tonight
we
had
screening
of
their
most
recent
film
lincoln
which
was
an
extraordinary
film
am
little
nervous
though
about
next
project
saw
look
on
well
let
just
check
it
out
roll
the
tape
tape
rolls
it
remarkable
transformation
do
really
sound
like
that
though
honey
marx
once
said
and
senator
marx
not
the
other
guy
marx
once
told
an
audience
before
speak
have
something
important
to
say
and
along
those
same
lines
want
to
close
on
more
serious
note
obviously
there
has
been
no
shortage
of
news
to
cover
over
these
past
few
weeks
and
these
have
been
some
very
hard
days
for
too
many
of
our
citizens
even
as
we
gather
here
tonight
our
thoughts
are
not
far
from
the
people
of
boston
and
the
people
of
west
texas
there
are
families
in
the
who
are
coping
with
some
terrible
floods
so
we
had
some
difficult
days
but
even
when
the
days
seemed
darkest
we
have
seen
humanity
shine
at
its
brightest
we
seen
first
responders
and
national
guardsmen
who
have
dashed
into
danger
law
enforcement
officers
who
lived
their
oath
to
serve
and
to
protect
and
everyday
americans
who
are
opening
their
homes
and
their
hearts
to
perfect
strangers
and
we
also
saw
journalists
at
their
best
especially
those
who
took
the
time
to
wade
upstream
through
the
torrent
of
digital
to
chase
down
leads
and
verify
facts
and
painstakingly
put
the
pieces
together
to
inform
and
to
educate
and
to
tell
stories
that
demanded
to
be
told
if
anyone
wonders
for
example
whether
newspapers
are
thing
of
the
past
all
you
needed
to
do
was
to
pick
up
or
log
on
to
papers
like
the
boston
globe
when
their
communities
and
the
wider
world
needed
them
most
they
were
there
making
sense
of
events
that
might
at
first
blush
seem
beyond
our
comprehension
and
what
great
journalism
is
and
what
great
journalists
do
and
why
for
example
new
nickname
around
the
newsroom
is
big
and
in
these
past
few
weeks
as
gotten
chance
to
meet
many
of
the
first
responders
and
the
police
officers
and
volunteers
who
raced
to
help
when
hardship
hits
was
reminded
as
always
reminded
when
meet
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
whether
they
in
war
or
here
back
home
or
at
reed
in
reminded
that
all
these
folks
they
do
it
to
be
they
do
it
to
be
celebrated
they
do
it
because
they
love
their
families
and
they
love
their
and
they
love
their
country
and
so
these
men
and
women
should
inspire
all
of
us
in
this
room
to
live
up
to
those
same
standards
to
be
worthy
of
their
trust
to
do
our
jobs
with
the
same
fidelity
and
the
same
integrity
and
the
same
sense
of
purpose
and
the
same
love
of
country
because
if
we
only
focused
on
profits
or
ratings
or
polls
then
we
contributing
to
the
cynicism
that
so
many
people
feel
right
now
and
so
those
of
us
in
this
room
tonight
we
are
incredibly
lucky
and
the
fact
is
we
can
do
better
all
of
us
those
of
us
in
public
office
those
of
us
in
the
press
those
who
produce
entertainment
for
our
kids
those
with
power
those
with
influence
all
of
us
including
myself
we
can
strive
to
value
those
things
that
suspect
led
most
of
us
to
do
the
work
that
we
do
in
the
first
place
because
we
believed
in
something
that
was
true
and
we
believed
in
service
and
the
idea
that
we
can
have
lasting
positive
impact
on
the
lives
of
the
people
around
us
and
our
obligation
task
we
should
gladly
embrace
on
behalf
of
all
of
those
folks
who
are
counting
on
us
on
behalf
of
this
country
given
us
so
much
so
thank
you
all
to
the
white
house

the
great
work
you
do

gathered

the
community
of
and
most
of
all
the
family
and
the
friends
and
of
west
texas
can
not
match
the
power
of
the
voices
you
just
heard
on
that
video
and
no
words
adequately
describe
the
courage
that
was
displayed
on
that
deadly
night
what
can
do
is
offer
the
love
and
support
and
prayers
of
the
nation
the
book
of
psalms
tells
us
for
you
god
have
tested
us
you
have
tried
us
we
went
through
fire
and
through
water
yet
you
have
brought
us
out
to
place
of
abundance
we
went
through
fire
and
through
water
yet
you
have
brought
us
out
to
place
of
for
this
state
and
for
our
country
these
have
been
trying
and
difficult
days
we
gather
here
in
texas
to
mourn
the
brave
men
who
went
through
fire
and
all
those
who
have
been
taken
from
us
we
remain
mindful
of
our
fellow
americans
in
flooded
states
to
the
north
who
endure
the
high
waters
we
pray
for
those
in
boston
who
have
been
tested
and
the
wounded
whose
greatest
tests
still
lie
ahead
but
know
this
while
the
eyes
of
the
world
may
have
been
fixed
on
places
far
away
our
hearts
have
also
been
here
in
your
time
of
tribulation
and
even
amidst
such
sorrow
and
so
much
pain
we
abundance
we
give
thanks
for
the
courage
and
the
compassion
and
the
incredible
grace
of
the
people
of
west
we
grateful
for
mayor
and
mayor
and
all
those
who
have
shown
such
leadership
during
this
tragedy
and
to
the
families
and
grappling
with
unbearable
loss
we
are
here
to
say
you
are
not
alone
you
are
not
forgotten
we
may
not
all
live
here
in
texas
but
we
too
we
americans
too
and
we
stand
with
you
and
we
do
not
forget
and
we
be
there
even
after
the
cameras
leave
and
after
the
attention
turns
elsewhere
your
country
will
remain
ever
ready
to
help
you
recover
and
rebuild
and
reclaim
your
community
now
until
last
week
think
fair
to
say
that
few
outside
this
state
had
ever
heard
of
west
and
suspect
the
way
most
people
in
west
like
it
now
it
is
true
that
weary
and
now
the
wider
world
know
they
can
rely
on
the
czech
stop
for
brief
respite
in
the
middle
of
long
stretch
of
highway
want
to
say
by
the
way
all
the
former
presidents
in
dallas
send
their
thoughts
and
prayers
george
and
bush
spoke
longingly
about
the
and
the
even
better
company
as
driven
through
west
and
what
what
they
understood
and
what
all
of
you
understand
is
what
makes
west
special
is
not
the
attention
coming
from
places
what
makes
west
special
what
what
puts
it
on
the
map
is
what
makes
it
familiar
the
people
who
live
there
you
can
count
on
places
that
changed
things
that
are
solid
and
true
and
lasting
most
of
the
people
in
west
know
everybody
in
west
many
of
you
are
probably
descended
from
some
of
those
first
settlers
hardy
immigrants
who
crossed
an
ocean
and
kept
on
going
so
for
you
no
such
thing
as
stranger
when
someone
in
need
you
reach
out
to
them
and
you
support
them
and
you
do
what
it
takes
to
help
them
carry
on
and
what
happened
last
when
fire
alarm
sounded
across
quiet
texas
evening
as
heard
the
call
went
out
to
volunteers
not
professionals
people
who
just
love
to
serve
people
who
want
to
help
their
call
went
out
to
farmers
and
car
salesmen
and
welders
and
funeral
home
directors
the
city
secretary
and
the
mayor
it
went
out
to
folks
who
are
tough
enough
and
selfless
enough
to
put
in
full
work
and
then
be
ready
for
more
and
together
you
answered
the
call
you
dropped
your
left
your
families
jumped
in
fire
trucks
and
rushed
to
the
flames
and
when
you
got
to
the
scene
you
forgot
fear
and
you
fought
that
blaze
as
hard
as
you
could
knowing
the
danger
buying
time
so
others
could
escape
and
then
about
minutes
after
the
first
alarm
the
earth
shook
and
the
sky
went
dark
and
west
changed
forever
today
our
prayers
are
with
the
families
of
all
who
lost
the
proud
sons
and
daughters
of
west
whose
memories
will
live
on
in
our
hearts
parents
who
loved
their
kids
and
leaders
who
served
their
communities
they
were
young
and
old
from
different
backgrounds
and
different
walks
of
life
few
were
just
going
about
their
business
an
awful
lot
ran
towards
the
scene
of
disaster
trying
to
help
one
was
described
as
the
kind
of
guy
whose
phone
was
always
ringing
with
folks
in
need
of
help
help
he
always
provided
just
who
these
folks
were
our
thoughts
are
with
those
who
face
long
road
the
wounded
the
heartbroken
the
families
who
lost
their
homes
and
possessions
in
an
instant
going
to
need
their
friends
in
west
but
also
going
to
need
their
friends
in
texas
and
their
friends
all
across
this
country
still
need
you
to
answer
that
call
they
will
need
those
things
that
are
lasting
and
true
for
as
scripture
teaches
us
friend
loves
at
all
times
and
brother
is
born
for
adversity
to
the
people
of
west
just
as
seen
the
love
you
share
in
better
times
as
friends
and
brothers
and
sisters
these
hard
days
have
shown
your
ability
to
stand
tall
in
times
of
unimaginable
adversity
you
saw
it
in
leaders
like
mayor
who
lost
close
friends
and
you
saw
it
in
the
hospital
staff
who
spent
the
night
treating
people
that
they
knew
toiling
through
their
tears
as
they
did
what
had
to
be
done
we
saw
it
in
the
folks
who
helped
evacuate
an
entire
nursing
home
including
one
man
who
drove
an
elderly
resident
to
safety
and
then
came
back
to
do
it
again
twice
we
saw
it
in
the
people
so
generous
that
when
the
red
cross
set
up
shelter
for
folks
who
go
back
to
their
homes
not
that
many
people
showed
up
because
most
had
already
been
offered
place
to
stay
with
their
friends
and
family
and
complete
strangers
drove
from
hundreds
of
miles
to
donate
supplies
firefighters
from
surrounding
communities
manned
the
stations
so
surviving
volunteers
could
recover
from
their
wounds
right
here
at
students
stood
in
line
for
hours
to
give
blood
and
nearby
school
district
opened
its
doors
to
the
students
who
go
back
to
their
classrooms
putting
welcome
signs
on
lockers
and
in
the
hallways
so
that
the
thing
about
this
tragedy
this
small
family
is
bigger
now
it
extends
beyond
the
boundaries
of
west
and
in
the
days
ahead
this
love
and
support
will
be
more
important
than
ever
because
there
will
be
moments
of
doubt
and
pain
and
the
temptation
to
wonder
how
this
community
will
ever
fully
recover
and
the
families
who
have
lost
such
remarkable
men
of
the
sort
that
we
saw
in
that
video
there
are
going
to
be
times
where
they
simply
do
understand
how
this
could
have
happened
but
today
see
in
the
people
of
west
in
your
eyes
that
what
makes
west
special
is
going
to
go
away
and
instead
of
changing
who
you
are
this
tragedy
has
simply
revealed
who
always
been
the
courage
of
who
works
as
cashier
just
around
the
corner
from
the
fire
station
she
said
going
to
be
tough
for
the
families
but
going
to
rebound
because
and
that
courage
will
bring
west
back
the
love
of
who
used
to
live
in
west
but
now
lives
in
and
last
week
she
drove
all
the
way
back
had
to
be
here
she
said
have
to
be
here
for
that
love
will
keep
west
going
the
faith
of
someone
like
pastor
john
that
will
sustain
the
good
people
of
west
for
as
long
as
it
takes
his
church
was
damaged
in
the
explosion
so
on
sunday
the
congregation
assembled
outside
what
happened
was
awful
he
told
them
god
is
bigger
than
all
of
this
god
is
bigger
than
all
of
this
and
he
is
here
with
you
in
west
he
is
bigger
than
all
of
this
and
he
is
here
with
you
going
forward
not
just
your
town
that
needs
your
courage
and
your
love
and
your
faith
america
does
too
we
need
towns
where
if
you
know
what
your
kids
are
up
to
then
chances
are
your
do
too
and
they
tell
on
those
kids
in
second
america
needs
towns
that
holds
fundraisers
to
help
folks
pay
the
medical
bills
and
then
take
the
time
to
drop
off
meal
because
they
know
family
is
under
stress
america
needs
communities
where
always
somebody
to
call
if
your
car
gets
stuck
or
your
house
gets
flooded
we
need
people
who
so
love
their
as
themselves
that
willing
to
lay
down
their
lives
for
them
america
needs
towns
like
west
what
makes
this
country
great
is
towns
like
west
for
you
god
have
tested
us
you
have
tried
us
we
went
through
fire
and
through
water
yet
you
have
brought
us
out
to
place
of
abundance
you
have
been
tested
west
you
have
been
tried
you
have
gone
through
fire
but
you
are
and
always
will
be
surrounded
by
an
abundance
of
love
you
saw
it
in
the
voices
on
those
videos
you
see
it
in
the
firefighters
and
first
responders
who
are
here
all
across
america
people
are
praying
for
you
and
thinking
of
you
and
when
they
see
the
faces
of
those
families
they
understand
that
these
are
not
strangers
these
are
and
why
we
know
that
we
will
get
through
this
god
bless
west
may
god
grant
his
peace
on
those
that
lost
his
comfort
to
their
families
may
he
continue
to
bless
this
great
state
of
texas
and
may
he
continue
to
bless
these
united
states
of
america
to
president
bush
and
bush
to
president
and
secretary
to
president
george
bush
and
bush
to
president
and
carter
to
current
and
former
world
leaders
and
all
the
distinguished
guests
here
today
and
are
to
be
with
you
to
mark
this
historic
occasion
this
is
party
and
worthy
of
what
here
to
do
today
the
life
and
legacy
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
george
bush
when
all
the
living
former
presidents
are
together
also
special
day
for
our
democracy
been
called
the
most
exclusive
club
and
we
do
have
pretty
nice
clubhouse
but
the
truth
is
our
club
is
more
like
support
group
the
last
time
we
all
got
together
was
just
before
took
office
and
needed
that
because
as
each
of
these
leaders
will
tell
you
no
matter
how
much
you
may
think
ready
to
assume
the
office
of
the
presidency
impossible
to
truly
understand
the
nature
of
the
job
until
yours
until
sitting
at
that
desk
and
why
every
president
gains
greater
appreciation
for
all
of
those
who
served
before
them
for
the
leaders
from
both
parties
who
taken
on
the
momentous
challenges
and
felt
the
enormous
weight
of
the
nation
on
their
shoulders
and
for
me
that
appreciation
very
much
extends
to
president
bush
the
first
thing
found
in
that
desk
the
day
took
office
was
letter
from
george
and
one
that
demonstrated
his
compassion
and
his
generosity
for
he
knew
that
would
come
to
learn
what
he
had
learned
that
being
president
above
all
is
humbling
job
there
are
moments
where
you
make
mistakes
there
are
times
where
you
wish
you
could
turn
back
the
clock
and
what
know
is
true
about
president
bush
and
hope
my
successor
will
say
about
me
is
that
we
love
this
country
and
we
do
our
best
now
in
the
past
president
bush
has
said
impossible
to
pass
judgment
on
his
presidency
while
still
alive
so
maybe
this
is
little
bit
premature
but
even
now
there
are
certain
things
that
we
know
for
certain
we
know
about
the
son
who
was
raised
by
two
strong
loving
parents
in
midland
famous
famously
inheriting
as
he
says
my
eyes
and
my
mouth
the
young
boy
who
once
came
home
after
trip
to
museum
and
proudly
presented
his
horrified
mother
with
small
dinosaur
he
had
smuggled
home
in
his
pocket
bet
that
went
over
great
with
we
know
about
the
young
man
who
met
the
love
of
his
life
at
dinner
party
ditching
his
plans
to
go
to
bed
early
and
instead
talking
with
the
brilliant
and
charming
late
into
the
night
we
know
about
the
father
who
raised
two
remarkable
caring
beautiful
daughters
even
after
they
tried
to
discourage
him
from
running
for
president
saying
dad
not
as
cool
as
you
think
you
are
president
can
relate
and
now
we
see
president
bush
the
grandfather
just
beginning
to
spoil
his
granddaughter
so
we
know
president
bush
the
man
and
what
president
said
is
absolutely
true
to
know
the
man
is
to
like
the
man
because
comfortable
in
his
own
skin
he
knows
who
he
is
he
put
on
any
he
takes
his
job
seriously
but
he
take
himself
too
seriously
he
is
good
man
but
we
also
know
something
about
george
bush
the
leader
as
we
walk
through
this
library
obviously
reminded
of
the
incredible
strength
and
resolve
that
came
through
that
as
he
stood
amid
the
rubble
and
the
ruins
of
ground
zero
promising
to
deliver
justice
to
those
who
had
sought
to
destroy
our
way
of
life
we
remember
the
compassion
that
he
showed
by
leading
the
global
fight
against
and
malaria
helping
to
save
millions
of
lives
and
reminding
people
in
some
of
the
poorest
corners
of
the
globe
that
america
cares
and
that
here
to
help
we
remember
his
commitment
to
reaching
across
the
aisle
to
unlikely
allies
like
ted
kennedy
because
he
believed
that
we
had
to
reform
our
schools
in
ways
that
help
every
child
learn
not
just
some
that
we
have
to
repair
broken
immigration
system
and
that
this
progress
is
only
possible
when
we
do
it
together
seven
years
ago
president
bush
restarted
an
important
conversation
by
speaking
with
the
american
people
about
our
history
as
nation
of
laws
and
nation
of
immigrants
and
even
though
comprehensive
immigration
reform
has
taken
little
longer
than
any
of
us
expected
am
hopeful
that
this
year
with
the
help
of
speaker
and
some
of
the
senators
and
members
of
congress
who
are
here
today
that
we
bring
it
home
for
our
families
and
our
economy
and
our
security
and
for
this
incredible
country
that
we
love
and
if
we
do
that
it
will
be
in
large
part
thanks
to
all
the
hard
work
of
president
george
bush
and
finally
president
bears
no
greater
decision
and
no
more
solemn
burden
than
serving
as
of
the
greatest
military
that
the
world
has
ever
known
as
president
bush
himself
has
said
america
must
and
will
keep
its
word
to
the
men
and
women
who
have
given
us
so
much
so
even
as
we
americans
may
at
times
disagree
on
matters
of
foreign
policy
we
share
profound
respect
and
reverence
for
the
men
and
women
of
our
military
and
their
families
and
we
are
united
in
our
determination
to
comfort
the
families
of
the
fallen
and
to
care
for
those
who
wear
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
on
the
flight
back
from
russia
after
negotiating
with
at
the
height
of
the
cold
war
president
kennedy
secretary
found
small
slip
of
paper
on
which
the
president
had
written
saying
know
there
is
god
and
see
storm
coming
if
he
has
place
for
me
believe
am
ready
no
one
can
be
completely
ready
for
this
office
but
america
needs
leaders
who
are
willing
to
face
the
storm
head
on
even
as
they
pray
for
god
strength
and
wisdom
so
that
they
can
do
what
they
believe
is
right
and
what
the
leaders
with
whom
share
this
stage
have
all
done
what
president

chose
to
do
why
to
be
part
of
today

that
is
set
before

monday
morning
the
sun
rose
over
boston

sunlight
glistened
off
the
dome
in
the
common
and
the
public
garden
spring
was
in
bloom
on
this
day
like
so
many
before

jumped
onto
the

see
the
at
in
runners
laced
up
their
shoes
and
set
out
on
test
of
dedication
and
grit
and
the
human
spirit
and
across
this
city
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lined
the
streets
to
hand
the
runners
cups
of
water
and
to
cheer
them
on
it
was
beautiful
day
to
be
in
boston
day
that
explains
why
poet
once
wrote
that
this
town
is
not
just
capital
not
just
place
boston
he
said
the
perfect
state
of
and
then
in
an
instant
the
beauty
was
shattered
celebration
became
tragedy
and
so
we
come
together
to
pray
and
mourn
and
measure
our
loss
but
we
also
come
together
today
to
reclaim
that
state
of
grace
to
reaffirm
that
the
spirit
of

city
is
undaunted

beloved
city
too
boston
may
be
your
but
we
claim
it
too
one
of
iconic
cities
one
of
the
great
cities
and
one
of
the
reasons
the
world
knows
boston
so
well
is
that
boston
opens
its
heart
to
the
world
over
successive
generations
welcomed
again
and
again

to
our
shores
immigrants

every
race
and
every
religion
every
shape
and
every
size
multitude

by
all
those
flags
that
flew
over
the
finish
line
so
whether
folks
come
here
to
boston
for
just
day
or
they
stay
here
for
years
they
leave
with
piece
of
this
town
tucked
firmly
into
their
hearts
so
boston
is
your
but
we
claim
it
little
bit
too
know
this
because
piece
of
boston
in
me
you
welcomed
me
as
young
law
student
across
the
river
welcomed
too
you
welcomed
me
during
convention
when
was
still
state
senator
and
very
few
people
could
pronounce
my
name
right
like
you
and
have
walked
these
streets
like
you
we
know
these
and
like
you
in
this
moment
of
grief
we
join
you
in
saying
my
for
millions
of
us
what
happened
on
monday
is
personal
personal
today
our
prayers
are
with
the
family
of
they
here
today
their
daughter
was
always
smiling
those
who
knew
her
said
that
with
her
red
hair
and
her
freckles
and
her
willingness
to
speak
her
mind
she
was
beautiful
sometimes
she
could
be
little
noisy
and
everybody
loved
her
for
it
she
would
have
turned
next
month
as
her
mother
said
through
her
tears
make
any
our
prayers
are
with
the
family
of
china
who
sent
their
daughter
to
so
that
she
could
experience
all
this
city
has
to
offer
she
was
student
far
from
home
and
in
the
heartache
of
her
family
and
friends
on
both
sides
of
great
ocean
reminded
of
the
humanity
that
we
all
share
our
prayers
are
with
the
family
of
to
and
their
young
daughter
as
they
fight
to
recover
and
our
hearts
are
broken
for
martin
with
his
big
smile
and
bright
eyes
his
last
hours
were
as
perfect
as
an
boy
could
hope
for
with
his
family
eating
ice
cream
at
sporting
event
and
left
with
two
enduring
images
of
this
little
boy
forever
smiling
for
his
beloved
and
forever
expressing
wish
he
made
on
blue
poster
board
more
hurting
people
no
more
hurting
people
peace
our
prayers
are
with
the
injured
so
many
wounded
some
gravely
from
their
beds
some
are
surely
watching
us
gather
here
today
and
if
you
are
know
this
as
you
begin
this
long
journey
of
recovery
your
city
is
with
you
your
commonwealth
is
with
you
your
country
is
with
you
we
will
all
be
with
you
as
you
learn
to
stand
and
walk
and
yes
run
again
of
that
have
no
doubt
you
will
run
again
you
will
run
again
because
what
the
people
of
boston
are
made
of
your
resolve
is
the
greatest
rebuke
to
whoever
committed
this
heinous
act
if
they
sought
to
intimidate
us
to
us
to
shake
us
from
those
values
that
described
the
values
that
make
us
who
we
are
as
americans
well
it
should
be
pretty
clear
by
now
that
they
picked
the
wrong
city
to
do
it
not
here
in
boston
not
here
in
boston
shown
us
boston
that
in
the
face
of
evil
americans
will
lift
up
good
in
the
face
of
cruelty
we
will
choose
compassion
in
the
face
of
those
who
would
visit
death
upon
innocents
we
will
choose
to
save
and
to
comfort
and
to
heal
choose
friendship
choose
love
scripture
teaches
us
has
not
given
us
spirit
of
fear
and
timidity
but
of
power
love
and
and
the
spirit
displayed
in
recent
days
when
doctors
and
nurses
police
and
firefighters
and
and
guardsmen
run
towards
explosions
to
treat
the
wounded
discipline
when
exhausted
runners
including
our
troops
and
veterans
who
never
expected
to
see
such
carnage
on
the
streets
back
home
become
first
responders
themselves
tending
to
the
injured
real
power
when
carry
victims
in
their
arms
deliver
water
and
blankets
line
up
to
give
blood
open
their
homes
to
total
strangers
give
them
rides
back
to
reunite
with
their
families
love
the
message
we
send
to
those
who
carried
this
out
and
anyone
who
would
do
harm
to
our
people
yes
we
will
find
you
and
yes
you
will
face
justice
we
will
find
you
we
will
hold
you
accountable
but
more
than
that
our
fidelity
to
our
way
of
life
to
our
free
and
open
society
will
only
grow
stronger
for
god
has
not
given
us
spirit
of
fear
and
timidity
but
one
of
power
and
love
and
like
bill
years
old
the
runner
in
the
orange
tank
top
who
we
all
saw
get
knocked
down
by
the
blast
we
may
be
momentarily
knocked
off
our
feet
but
pick
ourselves
up
keep
going
we
will
finish
the
race
in
the
words
of
pushed
his
disabled
son
rick
in
boston
marathons
let
something
like
this
stop
this
stop
us
and
what
taught
us
boston
what
reminded
us
to
push
on
to
persevere
to
not
grow
weary
to
not
get
faint
even
when
it
hurts
even
when
our
heart
aches
we
summon
the
strength
that
maybe
we
even
know
we
had
and
we
carry
on
we
finish
the
race
we
finish
the
race
and
we
do
that
because
of
who
we
are
and
we
do
that
because
we
know
that
somewhere
around
the
bend
stranger
has
cup
of
water
around
the
bend
somebody
is
there
to
boost
our
spirits
on
that
toughest
mile
just
when
we
think
that
hit
wall
someone
will
be
there
to
cheer
us
on
and
pick
us
up
if
we
fall
we
know
that
and
what
the
perpetrators
of
such
senseless
violence
these
small
stunted
individuals
who
would
destroy
instead
of
build
and
think
somehow
that
makes
them
important
what
they
understand
our
faith
in
each
other
our
love
for
each
other
our
love
for
country
our
common
creed
that
cuts
across
whatever
superficial
differences
there
may
be
that
is
our
power
our
strength
why
bomb
beat
us
why
we
down
why
we
cower
in
fear
we
carry
on
we
race
we
strive
we
build
and
we
work
and
we
love
and
we
raise
our
kids
to
do
the
same
and
we
come
together
to
celebrate
life
and
to
walk
our
cities
and
to
cheer
for
our
teams
when
the
and
and
patriots
or
are
champions
again
to
the
chagrin
of
new
york
and
chicago
fans
the
crowds
will
gather
and
watch
parade
go
down
street
and
this
time
next
year
on
the
third
monday
in
april
the
world
will
return
to
this
great
american
city
to
run
harder
than
ever
and
to
cheer
even
louder
for
the
boston
marathon
bet
on
it
tomorrow
the
sun
will
rise
over
boston
tomorrow
the
sun
will
rise
over
this
country
that
we
love
this
special
place
this
state
of
grace
scripture
tells
us
to
run
with
endurance
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
as
we
do
may
god
hold
close
those
been
taken
from
us
too
soon
may
he
comfort
their
families
and
may
he
continue
to
watch
over
these
united
states
of
america
good
evening
everybody
tonight
our
nation
is
in
debt
to
the
people
of
boston
and
the
people
of
after
vicious
attack
on
their
city
responded
with
resolve
and
determination
they
did
their
part
as
citizens
and
partners
in
this
investigation
boston
police
and
state
police
and
local
police
across
the
commonwealth
of
responded
with
professionalism
and
bravery
over
five
long
days
and
tonight
because
of
their
determined
efforts
we
closed
an
important
chapter
in
this
tragedy
been
briefed
earlier
this
evening
by
director
after
the
attacks
on
monday
directed
the
full
resources
of
the
federal
government
to
be
made
available
to
help
state
and
local
authorities
in
the
investigation
and
to
increase
security
as
needed
over
the
past
week
close
coordination
among
federal
state
and
local
officials
sharing
information
moving
swiftly
to
track
down
leads
has
been
critical
to
this
effort
they
all
worked
as
they
should
as
team
and
we
are
extremely
grateful
for
that
we
owe
tremendous
debt
of
gratitude
to
all
our
outstanding
law
enforcement
professionals
these
men
and
women
get
up
every
day
they
put
on
that
uniform
they
risk
their
lives
to
keep
us
safe
and
as
this
week
showed
they
do
always
know
what
to
expect
so
our
thoughts
are
with
those
who
were
wounded
in
pursuit
of
the
suspects
and
we
pray
for
their
full
recovery
we
also
send
our
prayers
to
the
collier
family
who
grieve
the
loss
of
their
son
and
brother
he
was
born
to
be
police
officer
said
his
chief
at
he
was
just
years
old
and
as
his
family
has
said
he
died
bravely
in
the
line
of
duty
doing
what
he
committed
his
life
to
doing
serving
and
protecting
others
so
we
grateful
to
him
obviously
tonight
there
are
still
many
unanswered
questions
among
them
why
did
young
men
who
grew
up
and
studied
here
as
part
of
our
communities
and
our
country
resort
to
such
violence
how
did
they
plan
and
carry
out
these
attacks
and
did
they
receive
any
help
the
families
of
those
killed
so
senselessly
deserve
answers
the
wounded
some
of
whom
now
have
to
learn
how
to
stand
and
walk
and
live
again
deserve
answers
and
so
instructed
the
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
our
intelligence
community
to
continue
to
deploy
all
the
necessary
resources
to
support
the
investigation
to
collect
intelligence
and
to
protect
our
citizens
we
will
determine
what
happened
we
will
investigate
any
associations
that
these
terrorists
may
have
had
and
we
continue
to
do
whatever
we
have
to
do
to
keep
our
people
safe
one
thing
we
do
know
is
that
whatever
hateful
agenda
drove
these
men
to
such
heinous
acts
will
not
can
not
prevail
whatever
they
thought
they
could
ultimately
achieve
they
already
failed
they
failed
because
the
people
of
boston
refused
to
be
intimidated
they
failed
because
as
americans
we
refused
to
be
they
failed
because
we
will
not
waver
from
the
character
and
the
compassion
and
the
values
that
define
us
as
country
nor
will
we
break
the
bonds
that
hold
us
together
as
americans
that
american
spirit
includes
staying
true
to
the
unity
and
diversity
that
makes
us
strong
like
no
other
nation
in
the
world
in
this
age
of
instant
reporting
and
tweets
and
there
temptation
to
latch
on
to
any
bit
of
information
sometimes
to
jump
to
conclusions
but
when
tragedy
like
this
happens
with
public
safety
at
risk
and
the
stakes
so
high
it
important
that
we
do
this
right
that
why
we
have
investigations
that
why
we
relentlessly
gather
the
facts
that
why
we
have
courts
and
that
why
we
take
care
not
to
rush
to
judgment
not
about
the
motivations
of
these
individuals
certainly
not
about
entire
groups
of
people
after
all
one
of
the
things
that
makes
america
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
but
also
one
of
the
things
that
makes
boston
such
great
city
is
that
we
welcome
people
from
all
around
the
world
people
of
every
faith
every
ethnicity
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
so
as
we
continue
to
learn
more
about
why
and
how
this
tragedy
happened
let
make
sure
that
we
sustain
that
spirit
tonight
we
think
of
all
the
wounded
still
struggling
to
recover
certainly
we
think
of
we
think
of
and
we
think
of
little
martin
their
lives
reflected
all
the
diversity
and
beauty
of
our
country
and
they
were
sharing
the
great
american
experience
together
finally
let
me
say
that
even
as
so
much
attention
has
been
focused
on
the
tragic
events
in
boston
understandably
we
also
seen
community
in
texas
devastated
by
terrible
explosion
and
want
them
to
know
that
they
are
not
forgotten
our
thoughts
our
prayers
are
with
the
people
of
west
texas
where
so
many
good
people
lost
their
lives
some
lost
their
homes
many
are
injured
many
are
still
missing
talked
to
governor
perry
and
mayor
and
pledged
that
the
people
of
west
will
have
the
resources
that
they
need
to
recover
and
rebuild
and
want
everybody
in
texas
to
know
that
we
will
follow
through
with
those
commitments
all
in
all
this
has
been
tough
week
but
we
seen
the
character
of
our
country
once
more
and
as
president
confident
that
we
have
the
courage
and
the
resilience
and
the
spirit
to
overcome
these
challenges
and
to
go
forward
as
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all
thank
you
very
much
everybody
few
months
ago
in
response
to
too
many
tragedies
including
the
shootings
of
united
states
here
today
and
the
murder
of
innocent
schoolchildren
and
their
teachers
this
country
took
up
the
cause
of
protecting
more
of
our
people
from
gun
violence
families
that
know
unspeakable
grief
summoned
the
courage
to
petition
their
elected
leaders
not
just
to
the
memory
of
their
children
but
to
protect
the
lives
of
all
our
children
and
few
minutes
ago
minority
in
the
united
states
senate
decided
it
worth
it
they
blocked
gun
reforms
even
while
these
families
looked
on
from
the
senate
gallery
by
now
well
known
that
percent
of
the
american
people
support
universal
background
checks
that
make
it
harder
for
dangerous
person
to
buy
gun
talking
about
convicted
felons
people
convicted
of
domestic
violence
people
with
severe
mental
illness
ninety
percent
of
americans
support
that
idea
most
americans
think
that
already
the
law
and
few
minutes
ago
percent
of
democrats
in
the
senate
just
voted
for
that
idea
but
not
going
to
happen
because
percent
of
republicans
in
the
senate
just
voted
against
that
idea
majority
of
senators
voted
yes
to
protecting
more
of
our
citizens
with
smarter
background
checks
but
by
this
continuing
distortion
of
senate
rules
minority
was
able
to
block
it
from
moving
forward
going
to
speak
plainly
and
honestly
about
happened
here
because
the
american
people
are
trying
to
figure
out
how
can
something
have
percent
support
and
yet
not
happen
we
had
democrat
and
republican
both
gun
owners
both
fierce
defenders
of
our
second
amendment
with
grades
from
the
come
together
and
worked
together
to
write
compromise
on
background
checks
and
want
to
thank
and
pat
for
their
courage
in
doing
that
that
was
not
easy
given
their
traditional
strong
support
for
second
amendment
rights
as
they
said
nobody
could
honestly
claim
that
the
package
they
put
together
infringed
on
our
second
amendment
rights
all
it
did
was
extend
the
same
background
check
rules
that
already
apply
to
guns
purchased
from
dealer
to
guns
purchased
at
gun
shows
or
over
the
internet
so
percent
of
guns
are
already
purchased
through
background
check
system
this
would
have
covered
lot
of
the
guns
that
are
currently
outside
that
system
their
legislation
showed
respect
for
gun
owners
and
it
showed
respect
for
the
victims
of
gun
violence
and
by
the
way
is
both
gun
owner
and
victim
of
gun
violence
she
is
westerner
and
moderate
and
she
supports
these
background
checks
in
fact
even
the
used
to
support
expanded
background
checks
the
current
leader
of
the
used
to
support
these
background
checks
so
while
this
compromise
contain
everything
wanted
or
everything
that
these
families
wanted
it
did
represent
progress
it
represented
moderation
and
common
sense
why
percent
of
the
american
people
supported
it
but
instead
of
supporting
this
compromise
the
gun
lobby
and
its
allies
lied
about
the
bill
they
claimed
that
it
would
create
some
sort
of
big
brother
gun
registry
even
though
the
bill
did
the
opposite
this
legislation
in
fact
outlawed
any
registry
plain
and
simple
right
there
in
the
text
but
that
matter
and
unfortunately
this
pattern
of
spreading
untruths
about
this
legislation
served
purpose
because
those
lies
upset
an
intense
minority
of
gun
owners
and
that
in
turn
intimidated
lot
of
senators
and
talked
to
several
of
these
senators
over
the
past
few
weeks
and
all
good
people
know
all
of
them
were
shocked
by
tragedies
like
and
also
understand
that
they
come
from
states
that
are
strongly
and
have
consistently
said
that
there
are
regional
differences
when
it
comes
to
guns
and
that
both
sides
have
to
listen
to
each
other
but
the
fact
is
most
of
these
senators
could
not
offer
any
good
reason
why
we
want
to
make
it
harder
for
criminals
and
those
with
severe
mental
illnesses
to
buy
gun
there
were
no
coherent
arguments
as
to
why
we
do
this
it
came
down
to
politics
the
worry
that
that
vocal
minority
of
gun
owners
would
come
after
them
in
future
elections
they
worried
that
the
gun
lobby
would
spend
lot
of
money
and
paint
them
as
amendment
and
obviously
lot
of
republicans
had
that
fear
but
democrats
had
that
fear
too
and
so
they
caved
to
the
pressure
and
they
started
looking
for
an
excuse
any
excuse
to
vote
no
one
common
argument
heard
was
that
this
legislation
prevent
all
future
massacres
and
true
as
said
from
the
start
no
single
piece
of
legislation
can
stop
every
act
of
violence
and
evil
we
learned
that
tragically
just
two
days
ago
but
if
action
by
congress
could
have
saved
one
person
one
child
few
hundred
few
thousand
if
it
could
have
prevented
those
people
from
losing
their
lives
to
gun
violence
in
the
future
while
preserving
our
second
amendment
rights
we
had
an
obligation
to
try
and
this
legislation
met
that
test
and
too
many
senators
failed
theirs
heard
some
say
that
blocking
this
step
would
be
victory
and
my
question
is
victory
for
who
victory
for
what
all
that
happened
today
was
the
preservation
of
the
loophole
that
lets
dangerous
criminals
buy
guns
without
background
check
that
make
our
kids
safer
victory
for
not
doing
something
that
percent
of
americans
percent
of
republicans
the
vast
majority
of
your
constituents
wanted
to
get
done
it
begs
the
question
who
are
we
here
to
represent
heard
folks
say
that
having
the
families
of
victims
lobby
for
this
legislation
was
somehow
misplaced
prop
somebody
called
them
emotional
blackmail
some
outlet
said
are
they
serious
do
we
really
think
that
thousands
of
families
whose
lives
have
been
shattered
by
gun
violence
have
right
to
weigh
in
on
this
issue
do
we
think
their
emotions
their
loss
is
not
relevant
to
this
debate
so
all
in
all
this
was
pretty
shameful
day
for
washington
but
this
effort
is
not
over
want
to
make
it
clear
to
the
american
people
we
can
still
bring
about
meaningful
changes
that
reduce
gun
violence
so
long
as
the
american
people
give
up
on
it
even
without
congress
my
administration
will
keep
doing
everything
it
can
to
protect
more
of
our
communities
going
to
address
the
barriers
that
prevent
states
from
participating
in
the
existing
background
check
system
going
to
give
law
enforcement
more
information
about
lost
and
stolen
guns
so
it
can
do
its
job
going
to
help
to
put
in
place
emergency
plans
to
protect
our
children
in
their
schools
but
we
can
do
more
if
congress
gets
its
act
together
and
if
this
congress
refuses
to
listen
to
the
american
people
and
pass
gun
legislation
then
the
real
impact
is
going
to
have
to
come
from
the
voters
to
all
the
people
who
supported
this
legislation
law
enforcement
and
responsible
gun
owners
democrats
and
republicans
urban
moms
rural
hunters
whoever
you
are
you
need
to
let
your
representatives
in
congress
know
that
you
are
disappointed
and
that
if
they
act
this
time
you
will
remember
come
election
time
to
the
wide
majority
of
households
who
supported
this
legislation
you
need
to
let
your
leadership
and
lobbyists
in
washington
know
they
represent
your
views
on
this
one
the
point
is
those
who
care
deeply
about
preventing
more
and
more
gun
violence
will
have
to
be
as
passionate
and
as
and
as
vocal
as
those
who
blocked
these
steps
to
help
keep
our
kids
safe
ultimately
you
outnumber
those
who
argued
the
other
way
but
they
better
they
better
financed
been
at
it
longer
and
they
make
sure
to
stay
focused
on
this
one
issue
during
election
time
and
that
the
reason
why
you
can
have
something
that
percent
of
americans
support
and
you
get
it
through
the
senate
or
the
house
of
representatives
so
to
change
washington
you
the
american
people
are
going
to
have
to
sustain
some
passion
about
this
and
when
necessary
got
to
send
the
right
people
to
washington
and
that
requires
strength
and
it
requires
persistence
and
that
the
one
thing
that
these
families
should
have
inspired
in
all
of
us
still
do
know
how
they
have
been
able
to
muster
up
the
strength
to
do
what
doing
over
the
last
several
weeks
last
several
months
and
see
this
as
just
round
one
when
happened
met
with
these
families
and
spoke
to
the
community
and
said
something
must
be
different
right
now
going
to
have
to
change
that
what
the
whole
country
said
everybody
talked
about
how
we
were
going
to
change
something
to
make
sure
this
did
happen
again
just
like
everybody
talked
about
how
we
needed
to
do
something
after
aurora
everybody
talked
about
we
needed
change
something
after
and
assuming
that
the
emotions
that
all
felt
since
the
emotions
that
all
felt
since
and
aurora
and
chicago
the
pain
we
share
with
these
families
and
families
all
across
the
country
lost
loved
one
to
gun
violence
assuming
that
not
temporary
thing
assuming
our
expressions
of
grief
and
our
commitment
to
do
something
different
to
prevent
these
things
from
happening
are
not
empty
words
believe
going
to
be
able
to
get
this
done
sooner
or
later
we
are
going
to
get
this
right
the
memories
of
these
children
demand
it
and
so
do
the
american
people
thank
you
very
much
everybody
good
morning
everybody
just
been
briefed
by
my
national
security
team
including
director
attorney
general
holder
secretary
and
my
and
homeland
security
monaco
on
the
attacks
in
boston
we
continue
to
and
deploy
all
appropriate
law
enforcement
resources
to
protect
our
citizens
and
to
investigate
and
to
respond
to
this
attack
obviously
our
first
thoughts
this
morning
are
with
the
victims
their
families
and
the
city
of
boston
we
know
that
two
explosions
gravely
wounded
dozens
of
americans
and
took
the
lives
of
others
including
boy
this
was
heinous
and
cowardly
act
and
given
what
we
now
know
about
what
took
place
the
is
investigating
it
as
an
act
of
terrorism
any
time
bombs
are
used
to
target
innocent
civilians
it
is
an
act
of
terror
what
we
yet
know
however
is
who
carried
out
this
attack
or
why
whether
it
was
planned
and
executed
by
terrorist
foreign
or
domestic
or
was
the
act
of
malevolent
individual
that
what
we
do
yet
know
and
clearly
at
the
beginning
of
our
investigation
it
will
take
time
to
follow
every
lead
and
determine
what
happened
but
we
will
find
out
we
will
find
whoever
harmed
our
citizens
and
we
will
bring
them
to
justice
we
also
know
this
the
american
people
refuse
to
be
because
what
the
world
saw
yesterday
in
the
aftermath
of
the
explosions
were
stories
of
heroism
and
kindness
and
generosity
and
love
exhausted
runners
who
kept
running
to
the
nearest
hospital
to
give
blood
and
those
who
stayed
to
tend
to
the
wounded
some
tearing
off
their
own
clothes
to
make
the
first
responders
who
ran
into
the
chaos
to
save
lives
the
men
and
women
who
are
still
treating
the
wounded
at
some
of
the
best
hospitals
in
the
world
and
the
medical
students
who
hurried
to
help
saying
we
heard
we
all
came
the
priests
who
opened
their
churches
and
ministered
to
the
hurt
and
the
fearful
and
the
good
people
of
boston
who
opened
their
homes
to
the
victims
of
this
attack
and
those
shaken
by
it
so
if
you
want
to
know
who
we
are
what
america
is
how
we
respond
to
evil
it
selflessly
compassionately
unafraid
in
the
coming
days
we
will
pursue
every
effort
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened
and
we
will
continue
to
remain
vigilant
directed
my
administration
to
take
appropriate
security
measures
to
protect
the
american
people
and
this
is
good
time
for
all
of
us
to
remember
that
we
all
have
part
to
play
in
alerting
authorities
if
you
see
something
suspicious
speak
up
have
extraordinary
confidence
in
the
men
and
women
of
the
the
boston
police
department
and
the
other
agencies
that
responded
so
heroically
and
effectively
in
the
aftermath
of
events
very
grateful
for
the
leadership
of
governor
and
mayor
and
know
that
even
as
we
protect
our
people
and
aggressively
pursue
this
investigation
the
people
of
boston
will
continue
to
respond
in
the
same
proud
and
heroic
way
that
they
have
thus
far
and
their
fellow
americans
will
be
right
there
with
them

you
very
much
and
you
can
expect
further
briefings
from
our
law
enforcement
officials
as
the
day
goes
on
when
we
have
more
details
they
will
be
disclosed
what
indicated
to
you
is
what
we
know
now
we
know
it
was
bombs
that
were
set
off
we
know
that
obviously
they
did
some
severe
damage
we
do
not
know
who
did
them
we
do
not
know
whether
this
was
an
act
of
an
or
an
individual
or
individuals
we
have
sense
of
motive
yet
so
everything
else
at
this
point
is
speculation
but

earlier
today
was
briefed
by
my
homeland
security
team
on
the
events
in
boston
continuing
to
monitor
and
respond
to
the
situation
as
it
unfolds
and
directed
the
full
resources
of
the
federal
to
help
state
and
local
authorities

our
people

security
around
the
united
states
as
necessary
and
investigate
what

the
american
people
will
say
prayer
for
boston
tonight
and
and
send
our
deepest
thoughts
and
prayers
to
the
families
of
the
victims
in
the
wake
of
this
senseless
loss
we
yet
have
all
the
answers
but
we
do
know
that
multiple
people
have
been
wounded
some
gravely
in
explosions
at
the
boston
marathon
spoken
to
director
and
secretary
of
homeland
security
and
the
appropriate
resources
to
investigate
and
to
respond
updated
leaders
of
congress
in
both
parties
and
we
reaffirmed
that
on
days
like
this
there
are
no
republicans
or
democrats
we
are
americans
united
in
concern
for
our
fellow
citizens
also
spoken
with
governor
and
mayor
and
made
it
clear
that
they
have
every
single
federal
resource
necessary
to
care
for
the
victims
and
counsel
the
families
and
above
all
made
clear
to
them
that
all
americans
stand
with
the
people
of
boston
boston
police
firefighters
and
first
responders
as
well
as
the
national
guard
responded
heroically
and
continue
to
do
so
as
we
speak
reminder
that
so
many
americans
serve
and
sacrifice
on
our
behalf
every
single
day
without
regard
to
their
own
safety
in
dangerous
and
difficult
circumstances
and
we
salute
all
those
who
assisted
in
responding
so
quickly
and
professionally
to
this
tragedy
we
still
do
not
know
who
did
this
or
why
and
people
jump
to
conclusions
before
we
have
all
the
facts
but
make
no
mistake
we
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
and
we
will
find
out
who
did
this
we
find
out
why
they
did
this
any
responsible
individuals
any
responsible
groups
will
feel
the
full
weight
of
justice
today
is
holiday
in
day
day
that
celebrates
the
free
and
fiercely
independent
spirit
that
this
great
american
city
of
boston
has
reflected
from
the
earliest
days
of
our
nation
and
day
that
draws
the
world
to
streets
in
spirit
of
friendly
competition
boston
is
tough
and
resilient
town
so
are
its
people
supremely
confident
that
will
pull
together
take
care
of
each
other
and
move
forward
as
one
proud
city
and
as
they
do
the
american
people
will
be
with
them
every
single
step
of
the
way
you
should
anticipate
that
as
we
get
more
information
our
teams
will
provide
you
briefings
we
still
in
the
investigation
stage
at
this
point
but
just
want
to
reiterate

out
who
did
this
and
we
will
hold
them
accountable

thank
you
chaplain
this
year
we
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
end
of
the
korean
war
time
when
thousands
of
our
prisoners
of
war
finally
came
home
after
years
of
starvation
and
hardship
and
in
some
cases
torture
and
among
the
homecomings
one
stood
out
group
of
our
emerged
carrying
large
wooden
crucifix
nearly
four
feet
tall
they
had
spent
months
on
it
secretly
collecting
firewood
carving
it
the
cross
and
the
body
using
radio
wire
for
crown
of
thorns
it
was
tribute
to
their
friend
their
chaplain
their
fellow
prisoner
who
had
touched
their
souls
and
saved
their
lives
father
this
is
an
amazing
story
father
has
been
called
shepherd
in
combat
boots
his
fellow
soldiers
who
felt
his
grace
and
his
mercy
called
him
saint
blessing
from
god
today
we
bestow
another
title
on
him
recipient
of
our
highest
military
decoration
the
medal
of
after
more
than
six
decades
of
working
to
make
this
medal
reality
know
one
of
father
comrades
spoke
for
lot
of
folks
here
when
he
said
about
time
father
as
they
called
him
was
just
years
old
when
he
died
in
that
hellish
prison
camp
his
parents
and
his
only
sibling
his
brother
are
no
longer
with
us
but
we
are
extremely
proud
to
welcome
members
of
the
family
his
nephews
his
niece
their
children
two
of
whom
currently
serve
in
this
country
national
guard
and
we
are
very
proud
of
them
we
also
joined
by
members
of
the
congressional
delegation
leaders
from
across
our
armed
forces
and
representatives
from
the
catholic
church
which
father
as
servant
of
god
and
we
are
truly
humbled
to
be
joined
by
men
who
served
alongside
him
veterans
and
former
from
the
korean
war
now
obviously
never
met
father
but
have
sense
of
the
man
he
was
because
in
his
story
see
reflections
of
my
own
grandparents
and
their
values
the
people
who
helped
to
raise
me
and
my
grandfather
were
both
born
in
about
the
same
time
both
were
raised
in
small
towns
outside
of
they
were
part
of
that
greatest
generation
surviving
the
depression
joining
the
army
serving
in
world
war
and
they
embodied
those
heartland
values
of
honesty
and
hard
work
decency
and
humility
quiet
determined
to
do
their
part
for
father
this
meant
becoming
an
army
chaplain
serving
god
and
country
after
the
communist
invasion
of
south
korea
he
was
among
the
first
american
troops
that
hit
the
beaches
and
pushed
their
way
north
through
hard
mountains
and
bitter
cold
in
his
understated
way
he
wrote
home
saying
this
outdoor
life
is
quite
the
thing
and
prefer
to
live
in
house
once
in
while
but
he
had
hope
saying
it
looks
like
the
war
will
end
soon
when
chinese
forces
entered
the
war
with
massive
surprise
attack
perhaps
soldiers
pouring
down
on
few
thousand
americans
in
the
chaos
dodging
bullets
and
explosions
father
raced
between
foxholes
out
past
the
front
lines
and
into
land
dragging
the
wounded
to
safety
when
his
commanders
ordered
an
evacuation
he
chose
to
stay
gathering
the
injured
tending
to
their
wounds
when
the
enemy
broke
through
and
the
combat
was
he
carried
on
comforting
the
injured
and
the
dying
offering
some
measure
of
peace
as
they
left
this
earth
when
enemy
forces
bore
down
it
seemed
like
the
end
that
these
wounded
americans
more
than
dozen
of
them
would
be
gunned
down
but
father
spotted
wounded
chinese
officer
he
pleaded
with
this
chinese
officer
and
convinced
him
to
call
out
to
his
fellow
chinese
the
shooting
stopped
and
they
negotiated
safe
surrender
saving
those
american
lives
then
as
father
was
being
led
away
he
saw
another
american
wounded
unable
to
walk
laying
in
ditch
an
enemy
soldier
was
standing
over
him
rifle
aimed
at
his
head
ready
to
shoot
and
father
marched
over
and
pushed
the
enemy
soldier
aside
and
then
as
the
soldier
watched
stunned
father
carried
that
wounded
american
away
this
is
the
we
today
an
american
soldier
who
fire
gun
but
who
wielded
the
mightiest
weapon
of
all
love
for
his
brothers
so
pure
that
he
was
willing
to
die
so
that
they
might
live
and
yet
the
incredible
story
of
father
does
not
end
there
he
carried
that
injured
american
for
miles
as
their
captors
forced
them
on
death
march
when
father
grew
tired
help
the
wounded
soldier
hop
on
one
leg
when
other
prisoners
stumbled
he
picked
them
up
when
they
wanted
to
quit
knowing
that
stragglers
would
be
shot
he
begged
them
to
keep
walking
in
the
camps
that
winter
deep
in
valley
men
could
freeze
to
death
in
their
sleep
father
offered
them
his
own
clothes
they
starved
on
tiny
rations
of
millet
and
corn
and
he
somehow
past
the
guards
foraged
in
nearby
fields
and
returned
with
rice
and
in
desperation
some
men
hoarded
food
he
convinced
them
to
share
their
bodies
were
ravaged
by
dysentery
he
grabbed
some
rocks
pounded
metal
into
pots
and
boiled
clean
water
they
lived
in
filth
he
washed
their
clothes
and
he
cleansed
their
wounds
the
guards
ridiculed
his
devotion
to
his
and
the
almighty
they
took
his
clothes
and
made
him
stand
in
the
freezing
cold
for
hours
yet
he
never
lost
his
faith
if
anything
it
only
grew
stronger
at
night
he
slipped
into
huts
to
lead
prisoners
in
prayer
saying
the
rosary
administering
the
sacraments
offering
three
simple
words
god
bless
you
one
of
them
later
said
that
with
his
very
presence
he
could
just
for
moment
turn
mud
hut
into
cathedral
that
spring
he
went
further
he
held
an
easter
service
just
met
with
the
family
they
showed
me
something
extraordinary
the
actual
stole
the
purple
vestment
that
father
wore
when
he
celebrated
mass
inside
that
prison
camp
as
the
sun
rose
that
easter
sunday
he
put
on
that
purple
stole
and
led
dozens
of
prisoners
to
the
ruins
of
an
old
church
in
the
camp
and
he
read
from
prayer
missal
that
they
had
kept
hidden
he
held
up
small
crucifix
that
he
had
made
from
sticks
and
as
the
guards
watched
father
and
all
those
prisoners
men
of
different
faith
perhaps
some
men
of
no
faith
sang
the
prayer
and
america
the
beautiful
they
sang
so
loud
that
other
prisoners
across
the
camp
not
only
heard
them
they
joined
in
too
filling
that
valley
with
song
and
with
prayer
that
faith
that
they
might
be
delivered
from
evil
that
they
could
make
it
home
was
perhaps
the
greatest
gift
to
those
men
that
even
amidst
such
hardship
and
despair
there
could
be
hope
amid
their
misery
in
the
temporal
they
could
see
those
truths
that
are
eternal
that
even
in
such
hell
there
could
be
touch
of
the
divine
looking
back
one
of
them
said
that
that
is
what
kept
lot
of
us
alive
yet
for
father
the
horrific
conditions
took
their
toll
thin
frail
he
began
to
limp
with
blood
clot
in
his
leg
and
then
came
dysentery
then
pneumonia
when
the
guards
saw
their
chance
to
finally
rid
themselves
of
this
priest
and
the
hope
he
inspired
they
came
for
him
and
over
the
protests
and
tears
of
the
men
who
loved
him
the
guards
sent
him
to
death
house
with
no
food
or
water
to
be
left
to
die
and
yet
even
then
his
faith
held
firm
going
to
where
always
wanted
to
go
he
told
his
brothers
and
when
get
up
there
say
prayer
for
all
of
you
and
then
as
was
taken
away
he
did
something
remarkable
he
blessed
the
guards
forgive
them
he
said
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
two
days
later
in
that
house
of
death
father
breathed
his
last
breath
his
body
was
taken
away
his
grave
unmarked
his
remains
to
this
day
the
war
and
the
awful
captivity
would
drag
on
for
another
two
years
but
these
men
held
on
steeled
by
the
memory
and
moral
example
of
the
man
they
called
father
and
on
their
first
day
of
freedom
in
his
they
carried
that
beautiful
wooden
crucifix
with
them
some
of
these
men
are
here
today
including
herb
miller
the
soldier
that
father
saved
in
that
ditch
and
then
carried
all
those
miles
many
are
now
in
their
but
make
no
mistake
they
are
among
the
strongest
men
that
america
has
ever
produced
and
would
ask
all
of
our
courageous
from
the
korean
war
to
stand
if
they
able
and
accept
the
gratitude
of
grateful
nation
told
that
in
their
darkest
hours
in
the
camp
in
that
valley
these
men
turned
to
psalm
as
we
prepare
for
the
presentation
of
the
medal
of
to
father
nephew
ray
want
to
leave
you
with
the
words
of
that
psalm

sustained
these
men

those
years
ago

the
shadow
of
death

thank
you

and
want
to
thank
the
people
of
for
everything
you
done
to
the
memories
of
the
victims
because
you
part
of
their
family
as
well
one
of
your
recent
alumni
was
therapist
at
sandy
hook
two
alumni
of
your
performing
arts
school
jimmy
and
lost
their
daughter
ana
an
incredible
vibrant
young
girl
who
looked
up
to
them
and
learned
from
them
and
inherited
their
talents
by
singing
before
she
could
talk
so
every
family
in
this
state
was
shaken
by
the
tragedy
of
that
morning
every
family
in
this
country
was
shaken
we
hugged
our
kids
more
tightly
we
asked
what
could
we
do
as
society
to
help
prevent
tragedy
like
that
from
happening
again
and
as
society
we
decided
that
we
have
to
change
we
must
we
must
change
noticed
that
and
others
refer
to
that
day
as
for
these
families
it
was
day
that
changed
everything
and
know
many
of
you
in
wondered
if
the
rest
of
us
would
live
up
to
the
promise
we
made
in
those
dark
days
if
we
change
too
or
if
once
the
television
trucks
left
once
the
candles
flickered
out
once
the
teddy
bears
were
carefully
gathered
up
that
the
country
would
somehow
move
on
to
other
things
over
the
weekend
heard
wheeler
who
lost
her
son
ben
that
day
say
that
the
four
months
since
the
tragedy
might
feel
like
brief
moment
for
some
but
for
her
it
feels
like
it
been
years
since
she
saw
ben
and
she
determined
not
to
let
what
happened
that
day
just
fade
away
we
not
going
anywhere
she
said
we
are
here
and
we
are
going
to
be
here
and
know
that
she
speaks
for
everybody
in
everybody
who
was
impacted
and
we
want
you
to
know
that
we
here
with
you
we
will
not
walk
away
from
the
promises
we
made
we
are
as
determined
as
ever
to
do
what
must
be
done
in
fact
here
to
ask
you
to
help
me
show
that
we
can
get
it
done
we
not
forgetting
we
forget
your
families
still
grieve
in
ways
most
of
us
comprehend
but
so
many
of
you
have
used
that
grief
to
make
difference
not
just
to
your
own
children
but
to
protect
the
lives
of
all
of
our
children
so
many
of
you
have
and
and
petitioned
your
elected
officials
with
love
and
logic
as
put
it
as
citizens
determined
to
right
something
gone
wrong
and
last
week
here
in
your
elected
leaders
responded
the
legislature
led
by
many
of
the
legislators
here
today
passed
new
measures
to
protect
more
of
our
children
and
our
communities
from
gun
violence
and
governor
signed
that
legislation
into
law
so
want
to
be
clear
you
the
families
of
people
across
you
helped
make
that
happen
your
voices
your
determination
made
that
happen
obviously
the
elected
leaders
did
an
extraordinary
job
moving
it
forward
but
it
could
have
happened
if
they
were
hearing
from
people
in
their
respective
districts
people
all
across
the
state
that
the
power
of
your
voice
and
by
the
way
is
not
alone
in
the
past
few
months
new
york
have
all
passed
new
gun
safety
reforms
as
well
these
are
all
states
that
share
an
awful
familiarity
with
gun
violence
whether
it
the
horror
of
mass
killings
or
the
street
crime
that
too
common
in
too
many
all
of
these
states
also
share
strong
tradition
of
hunting
and
sport
shooting
and
gun
ownership
it
been
part
of
the
fabric
of
people
lives
for
generations
and
every
single
one
of
those
states
including
here
in
decided
that
yes
we
can
protect
more
of
our
citizens
from
gun
violence
while
still
protecting
our
second
amendment
rights
those
two
things
do
contradict
each
other
we
can
pass
laws
that
protect
our
kids
and
protect
our
rights
so
has
shown
the
way
and
now
is
the
time
for
congress
to
do
the
same
now
is
the
time
for
congress
to
do
the
same
this
week
is
the
time
for
congress
to
do
the
same
now
back
in
january
just
few
months
after
the
tragedy
in
announced
series
of
executive
actions
to
reduce
gun
violence
and
keep
our
kids
safe
and
put
forward
proposals
much
like
those
that
passed
here
in
for
congress
to
consider
and
you
remember
in
my
state
of
the
union
address
urged
congress
to
give
those
proposals
vote
and
that
moment
is
now
as
soon
as
this
week
congress
will
begin
debating
these
proposals
to
reduce
gun
violence
your
senators
and
they
here
your
representatives
john
they
are
all
pushing
to
pass
this
legislation
but
much
of
congress
is
going
to
only
act
if
they
hear
from
you
the
american
people
so
here
what
we
have
to
do
audience
member
love
you
president
the
president
appreciate
that
here
what
we
got
to
do
we
have
to
tell
congress
it
time
to
require
background
check
for
anyone
who
wants
to
buy
gun
so
that
people
who
are
dangerous
to
themselves
and
others
can
not
get
their
hands
on
gun
let
make
that
happen
we
have
to
tell
congress
it
time
to
crack
down
on
gun
trafficking
so
that
folks
will
think
twice
before
buying
gun
as
part
of
scheme
to
arm
someone
who
pass
background
check
let
get
that
done
we
have
to
tell
congress
it
time
to
restore
the
ban
on
assault
weapons
and
limit
for
magazines
to
make
it
harder
for
gunman
to
fire
bullets
into
his
victims
in
less
than
five
minutes
let
put
that
to
vote
we
have
to
tell
congress
it
time
to
strengthen
school
safety
and
help
people
struggling
with
mental
health
problems
get
the
treatment
they
need
before
it
too
late
let
do
that
for
our
kids
and
for
our
communities
now
know
that
some
of
these
proposals
inspire
more
debate
than
others
but
each
of
them
has
the
support
of
the
majority
of
the
american
people
all
of
them
are
common
sense
all
of
them
deserve
vote
all
of
them
deserve
vote
consider
background
checks
over
the
past
years
background
checks
have
kept
more
than
million
dangerous
people
from
getting
their
hands
on
gun
group
of
police
officers
in
told
me
last
week
that
thanks
to
background
checks
they
been
able
to
stop
convicted
murderers
folks
under
restraining
orders
for
committing
violent
domestic
abuse
from
buying
gun
in
some
cases
they
actually
arrested
the
person
as
they
were
coming
to
purchase
the
gun
so
we
know
that
background
checks
can
work
but
the
problem
is
loopholes
in
the
current
law
let
so
many
people
avoid
background
checks
altogether
that
not
safe
it
does
make
sense
if
you
citizen
and
you
go
through
background
check
to
buy
gun
would
you
expect
other
people
to
play
by
the
same
rules
if
you
gun
seller
would
you
want
to
know
you
not
selling
your
gun
to
someone
who
likely
to
commit
crime
should
we
make
it
harder
not
easier
for
somebody
who
is
convicted
of
domestic
abuse
to
get
his
hands
on
gun
it
turns
out
percent
of
americans
think
so
ninety
percent
of
americans
support
universal
background
checks
think
about
that
how
often
do
percent
of
americans
agree
on
anything
and
yet
percent
agree
on
this
republicans
democrats
folks
who
own
guns
folks
who
do
own
guns
percent
of
republicans
more
than
percent
of
gun
owners
more
than
percent
of
households
it
is
common
sense
and
yet
there
is
only
one
thing
that
can
stand
in
the
way
of
change
that
just
about
everybody
agrees
on
and
that
politics
in
washington
you
would
think
that
with
those
numbers
congress
would
rush
to
make
this
happen
that
what
you
would
think
if
our
democracy
is
working
the
way
it
supposed
to
and
percent
of
the
american
people
agree
on
something
in
the
wake
of
tragedy
you
think
this
would
not
be
heavy
lift
and
yet
some
folks
back
in
washington
are
already
floating
the
idea
that
they
may
use
political
stunts
to
prevent
votes
on
any
of
these
reforms
think
about
that
they
not
just
saying
they
vote
no
on
ideas
that
almost
all
americans
support
they
saying
they
do
everything
they
can
to
even
prevent
any
votes
on
these
provisions
they
saying
your
opinion
does
matter
and
that
not
right
audience
the
president
that
is
not
right
audience
we
want
vote
the
president
we
need
vote
audience
we
want
vote
we
want
vote
the
president
we
need
vote
audience
we
want
vote
the
president
now
also
heard
some
in
the
washington
press
suggest
that
what
happens
to
gun
violence
legislation
in
congress
this
week
will
either
be
political
victory
or
defeat
for
me
this
is
not
about
me
this
is
not
about
politics
this
is
about
doing
the
right
thing
for
all
the
families
who
are
here
that
have
been
torn
apart
by
gun
violence
it
about
them
and
all
the
families
going
forward
so
we
can
prevent
this
from
happening
again
that
what
it
about
it
about
the
law
enforcement
officials
putting
their
lives
at
risk
that
what
this
is
about
this
is
not
about
politics
this
is
not
about
politics
this
is
about
these
families
and
families
all
across
the
country
who
are
saying
let
make
it
little
harder
for
our
kids
to
get
gunned
down
when
said
in
my
state
of
the
union
address
that
these
proposals
deserve
vote
that
families
of
and
aurora
and
and
former
member
of
congress
that
they
all
deserved
vote
virtually
every
member
of
that
chamber
stood
up
and
applauded
and
now
they
going
to
start
denying
your
families
vote
when
the
cameras
are
off
and
when
the
lobbyists
have
worked
what
they
do
you
deserve
better
than
that
you
deserve
vote
now
look
we
knew
from
the
beginning
of
this
debate
that
change
would
not
be
easy
we
knew
that
there
would
be
powerful
interests
that
are
very
good
at
confusing
the
subject
that
are
good
at
amplifying
conflict
and
extremes
that
are
good
at
drowning
out
rational
debate
good
at
up
irrational
fears
all
of
which
stands
in
the
way
of
progress
but
if
our
history
teaches
us
anything
then
it
up
to
us
the
people
to
stand
up
to
those
who
say
we
or
we
stand
up
for
the
change
that
we
need
and
believe
that
that
what
the
american
people
are
looking
for
when
first
ran
for
this
office
said
that
did
not
believe
the
country
was
as
divided
as
our
politics
would
suggest
and
still
believe
that
know
sometimes
when
you
watch
cable
news
or
talk
radio
or
you
browse
the
internet
you
think
man
everybody
just
hates
each
other
everybody
is
just
at
each
other
throats
but
that
not
how
most
americans
think
about
these
issues
there
are
good
people
on
both
sides
of
every
issue
so
if
we
going
to
move
forward
we
just
talk
past
one
another
we
got
to
listen
to
one
another
that
what
governor
and
all
these
legislative
leaders
did
that
why
they
were
able
to
pass
bipartisan
legislation
got
stacks
of
letters
from
gun
owners
who
want
me
to
know
that
they
care
passionately
about
their
right
to
bear
arms
do
want
them
infringed
upon
and
appreciate
every
one
of
those
letters
learned
from
them
but
lot
of
those
letters
what
they
also
said
is
they
not
just
gun
owners
they
also
parents
or
police
officers
or
veterans
and
they
agree
that
we
stand
by
and
keep
letting
these
tragedies
happen
that
with
our
rights
come
some
responsibilities
and
obligations
to
our
communities
and
ourselves
and
most
of
all
to
our
children
we
just
think
about
us
we
got
to
think
about
we
the
people
was
in
told
story
about
she
came
back
from
trip
to
rural
we
were
out
there
campaigning
sometimes
it
would
be
miles
between
farms
let
alone
towns
and
she
said
you
know
coming
back
can
understand
why
somebody
would
want
gun
for
protection
if
somebody
drove
up
into
the
driveway
and
you
were
home
the
sheriff
lived
miles
away
might
want
that
security
so
she
can
understand
what
it
might
be
like
in
terms
of
somebody
wanting
that
kind
of
security
on
the
other
hand
also
talked
to
hunter
last
week
who
said
all
my
experiences
with
guns
have
been
positive
but
also
that
for
others
all
their
experiences
with
guns
have
been
negative
and
when
he
said
that
thought
about
the
mom
met
from
suburban
chicago
whose
son
was
killed
in
random
shooting
and
this
mom
told
me
hate
it
when
people
tell
me
that
my
son
was
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
he
was
on
his
way
to
school
he
was
exactly
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
he
was
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
he
still
got
shot
the
kids
at
sandy
hook
were
where
they
were
supposed
to
be
so
were
those
in
aurora
so
were
those
worshippers
in
oak
creek
so
was
she
was
at
supermarket
listening
to
the
concerns
of
her
constituents
they
were
exactly
where
they
were
supposed
to
be
they
were
also
exercising
their
rights
to
assemble
peaceably
to
worship
freely
and
safely
they
were
exercising
the
rights
of
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
so
surely
we
can
reconcile
those
two
things
surely
america
does
have
to
be
divided
between
rural
and
urban
and
democrat
and
republican
when
it
comes
to
something
like
this
if
you
an
american
who
wants
to
do
something
to
prevent
more
families
from
knowing
the
immeasurable
anguish
that
these
families
here
have
known
then
we
have
to
act
now
is
the
time
to
get
engaged
now
is
the
time
to
get
involved
now
is
the
time
to
push
back
on
fear
and
frustration
and
misinformation
now
is
the
time
for
everybody
to
make
their
voices
heard
from
every
state
house
to
the
corridors
of
congress
and
asking
everyone
listening
today
find
out
where
your
member
of
congress
stands
on
this
if
they
not
part
of
the
percent
of
americans
who
agree
on
background
checks
then
ask
them
why
not
why
would
you
want
to
make
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
to
do
their
job
why
would
you
want
to
make
it
harder
for
dangerous
person
to
get
his
or
her
hands
on
gun
what
more
important
to
you
our
children
or
an
from
the
gun
lobby
heard
talk
about
what
her
life
has
been
like
since
was
taken
from
her
in
december
and
one
thing
she
said
struck
me
she
said
every
night
beg
for
him
to
come
to
me
in
my
dreams
so
that
can
see
him
again
and
during
the
day
just
focus
on
what
need
to
do
to
him
and
make
change
now
if
can
summon
the
courage
to
do
that
how
can
the
rest
of
us
do
any
less
how
can
we
do
any
less
if
there
is
even
one
thing
we
can
do
to
protect
our
kids
do
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
if
there
is
even
one
step
we
can
take
to
keep
somebody
from
murdering
dozens
of
innocents
in
the
span
of
minutes
should
we
be
taking
that
step
if
there
is
just
one
thing
we
can
do
to
keep
one
father
from
having
to
bury
his
child
is
that
worth
fighting
for
got
to
tell
you
had
tough
days
in
the
presidency
said
this
before
the
day
happened
was
the
toughest
day
of
my
presidency
but
got
to
tell
you
if
we
do
respond
to
this
that
will
be
tough
day
for
me
too
because
we
got
to
expect
more
from
ourselves
and
we
got
to
expect
more
from
congress
we
got
to
believe
that
every
once
in
while
we
set
politics
aside
and
we
just
do
what
right
we
got
to
believe
that
and
if
you
believe
that
asking
you
to
stand
up
if
you
believe
in
the
right
to
bears
arms
like
do
but
think
we
should
prevent
an
irresponsible
few
from
inflicting
harm
stand
up
stand
up
if
you
believe
that
the
families
of
and
aurora
and
and
virginia
tech
and
the
thousands
of
americans
who
have
been
gunned
down
in
the
last
four
months
deserve
vote
we
all
have
to
stand
up
if
you
want
the
people
you
send
to
washington
to
have
just
an
iota
of
the
courage
that
the
educators
at
sandy
hook
showed
when
danger
arrived
on
their
doorstep
then
we
all
going
to
have
to
stand
up
and
if
we
do
if
we
come
together
and
raise
our
voices
together
and
demand
this
change
together
convinced
cooperation
and
common
sense
will
prevail
we
will
find
sensible
intelligent
ways
to
make
this
country
stronger
and
safer
for
our
children
so
let
do
the
right
thing
let
do
right
by
our
kids
let
do
right
by
these
families
let
get
this
done
thank
you
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
well
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
in
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
in
denver
want
to
thank
chief
white
for
that
introduction
got
some
outstanding
elected
officials
who
are
here
today
and
want
to
acknowledge
them
first
of
all
wonderful
governor
john
is
here
here
somewhere
know
because
just
talked
to
him
there
he
is
next
to
him
an
outstanding
lieutenant
governor
one
of
the
finest
young
senators
in
the
country
is
here
terrific
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
and
your
own
mayor
is
here
want
to
say
thank
you
to
the
denver
police
for
having
me
here
and
more
importantly
for
the
outstanding
work
that
all
of
you
do
each
and
every
day
to
serve
your
communities
and
protect
your
citizens
before
came
out
here
had
chance
to
sit
down
with
some
local
law
enforcement
attorney
general
holder
and
some
of
the
leaders
just
mentioned
the
wonderful
mayor
of
aurora
here
sportsmen
parents
loved
ones
of
the
victims
of
the
shootings
in
and
aurora
and
we
talked
about
what
we
can
do
to
protect
more
of
our
citizens
from
gun
violence
and
from
the
beginning
of
this
effort
wanted
law
enforcement
front
and
in
shaping
this
discussion
and
the
reforms
that
emerge
from
it
because
law
enforcement
lives
this
every
day
law
enforcement
are
the
first
to
see
the
terrible
consequences
of
any
kind
of
violence
certainly
gun
violence
lives
lost
families
broken
communities
that
are
changed
forever
very
often
in
the
line
of
fire
the
law
enforcement
knows
what
works
and
what
and
so
we
wanted
that
experience
and
that
advice
and
it
was
also
important
for
us
to
hear
from
mayors
like
because
been
on
the
front
lines
having
to
deal
with
these
issues
under
incredibly
sad
circumstances
and
come
to
denver
today
in
particular
because
is
proving
model
of
possible
now
been
just
over
days
since
the
murder
of
innocent
children
and
six
brave
educators
in
an
event
that
shocked
this
country
and
think
parents
all
across
the
country
to
say
got
to
do
something
more
to
protect
our
kids
but
consider
this
over
those
days
or
so
more
than
times
as
many
americans
have
fallen
victim
to
gun
violence
more
than
of
our
fellow
citizens
struck
down
often
because
they
were
just
going
about
their
daily
round
they
doing
anything
special
just
doing
what
folks
do
every
day
shopping
going
to
school
every
day
that
we
wait
to
do
something
about
it
even
more
of
our
fellow
citizens
are
stolen
from
our
lives
by
bullet
from
gun
now
the
good
news
is
has
already
chosen
to
do
something
about
it
look
this
is
state
that
has
suffered
the
tragedy
of
two
of
the
worst
mass
shootings
in
our
history
years
ago
this
month
in
and
just
last
year
in
aurora
but
this
is
also
state
that
treasures
its
second
amendment
rights
the
state
of
proud
hunters
and
sportsmen
and
by
the
way
the
governor
wanted
me
to
remind
everybody
that
there
is
outstanding
elk
hunting
here
in
strong
tradition
of
gun
ownership
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
and
part
of
the
fabric
of
lives
and
they
treat
gun
ownership
with
reverence
and
respect
and
so
here
because
believe
there
does
have
to
be
conflict
in
reconciling
these
realities
there
have
to
be
conflict
between
protecting
our
citizens
and
protecting
our
second
amendment
rights
got
stacks
of
letters
in
my
office
from
proud
gun
owners
whether
for
sport
or
protection
or
collection
who
tell
me
how
deeply
they
cherish
their
rights
want
them
infringed
upon
but
they
still
want
us
to
do
something
to
stop
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
and
appreciate
every
one
of
those
letters
and
learned
from
them
and
think
that
has
shown
that
practical
progress
is
possible
thanks
to
the
leadership
of
governor
and
some
of
the
state
legislators
who
are
here
today
when
was
talking
to
he
mentioned
that
aurora
is
very
much
purple
city
got
majority
republican
city
council
majority
of
the
state
legislators
are
democrat
but
they
came
together
understanding
that
out
of
this
tragedy
there
had
to
be
something
that
made
sense
and
so
seen
enacted
tougher
background
checks
that
infringe
on
the
rights
of
responsible
gun
owners
but
will
help
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
now
in
january
just
few
weeks
after
put
forward
series
of
proposals
along
the
same
lines
as
passed
here
in
to
reduce
gun
violence
and
keep
our
kids
safe
in
my
state
of
the
union
address
urged
congress
to
give
these
proposals
vote
and
by
the
way
before
we
even
asked
for
vote
had
already
signed
numerous
executive
orders
doing
what
we
could
administratively
to
make
sure
that
guns
do
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
wrong
people
but
what
said
then
is
still
true
if
we
really
going
to
tackle
this
problem
seriously
then
we
got
to
get
congress
to
take
the
next
step
and
as
soon
as
next
week
they
will
be
voting
as
soon
as
next
week
every
senator
will
get
to
vote
on
whether
or
not
we
should
require
background
checks
for
anyone
who
wants
to
purchase
gun
now
some
say
well
we
already
have
background
checks
and
they
right
over
the
past
years
those
background
checks
have
kept
more
than
million
dangerous
people
from
buying
gun
but
the
loopholes
that
currently
exist
in
the
law
have
allowed
way
too
many
criminals
and
folks
who
be
getting
guns
it
has
allowed
them
to
avoid
background
checks
entirely
that
makes
it
harder
for
law
enforcement
to
do
its
job
it
not
safe
it
not
smart
and
by
the
way
it
not
fair
to
responsible
gun
owners
who
are
playing
by
the
rules
now
understand
nobody
is
talking
about
creating
an
entirely
new
system
we
are
simply
talking
about
plugging
holes
sealing
porous
system
that
is
working
as
well
as
it
should
if
you
want
to
buy
gun
whether
it
from
licensed
dealer
or
private
seller
you
should
at
least
have
to
pass
background
check
to
show
you
not
criminal
or
someone
legally
prohibited
from
buying
on
and
just
common
sense
during
our
discussion
with
governor
who
know
was
in
the
midst
of
this
passionate
debate
about
the
legislation
here
in
and
some
people
said
well
background
checks
are
going
to
stop
everybody
and
the
governor
was
the
first
one
to
acknowledge
yes
they
stop
everybody
but
as
he
pointed
out
statistically
there
are
whole
bunch
of
folks
who
have
been
stopped
as
consequence
of
background
checks
law
enforcement
has
been
able
to
stop
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
murder
from
getting
gun
people
who
are
under
restraining
orders
for
having
committed
violent
domestic
abuse
from
getting
gun
in
couple
of
cases
the
governor
mentioned
to
me
law
enforcement
has
actually
been
able
to
arrest
people
who
came
to
pick
up
their
gun
because
they
were
criminals
wanted
so
this
does
work
and
by
the
way
if
selling
gun
you
want
to
know
who
selling
it
to
you
want
to
know
you
want
in
your
conscience
to
know
that
the
person
selling
to
going
to
commit
crime
so
these
enhanced
background
checks
stop
all
gun
crimes
but
they
will
certainly
help
prevent
some
this
is
common
sense
and
by
the
way
most
gun
owners
more
than
percent
agree
this
makes
sense
more
than
percent
of
members
agree
ninety
percent
of
the
american
people
agree
so
no
reason
we
do
this
unless
politics
is
getting
in
the
way
no
reason
we
do
this
as
soon
as
next
week
every
senator
will
get
chance
to
vote
on
proposal
to
help
strengthen
school
safety
and
help
people
struggling
with
mental
health
problems
get
the
treatment
that
they
need
as
soon
as
next
week
every
senator
will
get
to
vote
on
whether
or
not
we
should
crack
down
on
folks
who
buy
guns
as
part
of
scheme
to
arm
criminals
that
would
keep
more
guns
off
the
streets
and
out
of
the
hands
of
people
who
are
intent
on
doing
harm
and
it
would
make
life
whole
lot
easier
and
safer
for
the
people
behind
me
police
officers
every
senator
will
get
say
on
whether
or
not
we
should
keep
weapons
of
war
and
ammunition
magazines
that
facilitate
mass
killings
off
our
streets
the
type
of
assault
rifle
used
in
aurora
for
example
when
paired
with
magazine
has
one
purpose
to
pump
out
as
many
bullets
as
possible
as
fast
as
possible
what
allowed
that
gunman
to
shoot
people
and
kill
in
matter
of
few
minutes
believe
that
weapons
designed
for
of
war
have
place
in
movie
most
americans
agree
with
that
most
of
these
ideas
are
not
controversial
right
now
percent
of
americans
percent
support
background
checks
that
will
keep
criminals
and
people
who
have
been
found
to
be
danger
to
themselves
or
others
from
buying
gun
more
than
percent
of
republicans
agree
most
gun
owners
agree
think
about
it
how
often
do
percent
of
americans
agree
on
anything
and
yet
there
are
already
some
senators
back
in
washington
floating
the
idea
that
they
might
use
obscure
procedural
stunts
to
prevent
or
delay
any
of
these
votes
on
reform
think
about
that
not
just
saying
vote
on
the
proposal
that
most
americans
support
saying
do
everything
they
can
to
avoid
even
allowing
vote
on
proposal
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
american
people
support
saying
your
opinion
matter
we
knew
from
the
beginning
that
change
be
easy
and
we
knew
that
there
would
be
powerful
voices
that
would
do
everything
they
could
to
run
out
the
clock
change
the
subject
ignore
the
majority
of
the
american
people
we
knew
try
to
make
any
progress
collapse
under
the
weight
of
fear
and
frustration
or
maybe
people
would
just
stop
paying
attention
the
only
way
this
time
will
be
different
is
if
the
american
people
demand
that
this
time
it
must
be
different
that
this
time
we
must
do
something
to
protect
our
communities
and
our
kids
we
need
parents
we
need
teachers
we
need
police
officers
we
need
pastors
we
need
hunters
and
sportsmen
americans
of
every
background
to
say
suffered
too
much
pain
and
care
too
much
about
our
children
to
allow
this
to
continue
not
going
to
just
wait
for
the
next
or
the
next
aurora
before
we
act
and
genuinely
believe
what
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
care
what
party
they
belong
to
what
they
want
they
just
want
to
see
some
progress
it
was
interesting
during
the
conversation
number
of
people
talked
about
the
trust
issue
part
of
the
reason
it
so
hard
to
get
this
done
is
because
both
sides
of
the
debate
sometimes
do
listen
to
each
other
the
people
who
take
absolute
positions
on
these
issues
on
both
sides
sometimes
are
willing
to
concede
even
an
inch
of
ground
and
so
one
of
the
questions
we
talked
about
was
how
do
you
build
trust
how
do
you
rebuild
some
trust
and
told
the
story
about
two
conversations
had
the
first
conversation
was
when
came
back
from
doing
some
campaigning
out
in
rural
and
we
were
sitting
at
dinner
and
she
had
been
to
like
big
county
lot
of
driving
out
there
lot
of
farmland
and
she
said
if
was
living
out
in
farm
in
probably
want
gun
too
if
somebody
just
drives
up
into
your
driveway
and
you
not
home
you
do
know
who
these
people
are
and
you
do
know
how
long
it
going
to
take
for
the
sheriffs
to
respond
can
see
why
you
want
some
guns
for
protection
that
one
conversation
had
another
conversation
just
couple
of
months
ago
with
mom
from
chicago
actually
illinois
whose
son
had
been
killed
in
random
shooting
and
she
said
you
know
hate
it
when
people
tell
me
that
my
son
was
shot
because
he
was
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
he
was
in
the
right
place
he
was
on
his
way
to
school
he
was
in
the
wrong
place
he
was
exactly
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
now
both
those
things
are
true
and
sometimes
we
so
divided
between
rural
and
urban
and
folks
whose
hunting
is
part
of
their
lives
and
folks
whose
only
experience
with
guns
is
street
crime
and
the
two
sides
just
talk
past
one
another
and
more
than
anything
what
want
to
just
is
there
are
good
people
on
both
sides
of
this
thing
but
we
have
to
be
able
to
put
ourselves
in
the
other
person
shoes
if
you
hunter
if
you
sportsman
if
you
have
gun
in
your
house
for
protection
you
got
to
understand
what
it
feels
like
for
that
mom
whose
son
was
randomly
shot
and
if
you
live
in
an
urban
area
and
you
worried
about
street
crime
you
got
to
understand
what
it
might
be
like
if
you
grew
out
on
ranch
and
your
dad
had
been
taking
you
hunting
all
your
life
and
we
had
couple
of
sportsmen
in
our
conversation
today
and
thought
one
of
them
said
something
very
important
he
said
all
my
experiences
with
guns
have
been
positive
but
that
for
others
all
their
experiences
about
guns
have
been
negative
well
that
start
right
if
we
start
listening
to
each
other
then
we
should
be
able
to
get
something
done
that
constructive
we
should
be
able
to
get
that
done
one
last
thing
going
to
mention
is
that
during
this
conversation
hope
you
do
mind
me
quoting
you
thought
also
made
an
important
point
and
that
is
that
the
opponents
of
some
of
these
laws
have
up
fears
among
responsible
gun
owners
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
being
proposed
and
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts
but
feeds
into
this
suspicion
about
government
you
hear
some
of
these
quotes
need
gun
to
protect
myself
from
the
do
background
checks
because
the
government
is
going
to
come
take
my
guns
well
the
government
is
us
these
officials
are
elected
by
you
they
are
elected
by
you
am
elected
by
you
am
constrained
as
they
are
constrained
by
system
that
our
founders
put
in
place
government
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
and
so
surely
we
can
have
debate
that
not
based
on
the
notion
somehow
that
your
elected
representatives
are
trying
to
do
something
to
you
other
than
potentially
prevent
another
group
of
families
from
grieving
the
way
the
families
of
aurora
or
or
have
grieved
got
to
get
past
some
of
the
rhetoric
that
gets
perpetuated
that
breaks
down
trust
and
is
so
over
the
top
that
it
just
shuts
down
all
discussion
and
important
for
all
of
us
when
we
hear
that
kind
of
talk
to
say
hold
on
second
if
there
are
any
folks
who
are
out
there
right
now
who
are
gun
owners
and
been
hearing
that
somehow
somebody
is
taking
away
your
guns
get
the
facts
not
proposing
gun
registration
system
proposing
background
checks
for
criminals
do
just
listen
to
what
some
advocates
or
folks
who
have
an
interest
in
this
thing
are
saying
look
at
the
actual
legislation
that
what
happened
here
in
and
hopefully
if
we
know
the
facts
and
listening
to
each
other
then
we
can
actually
move
forward
and
what
members
of
congress
need
to
hear
from
you
right
now
members
of
congress
are
at
home
in
their
districts
many
of
them
are
holding
events
where
they
can
hear
from
their
constituents
so
asking
anyone
out
there
who
is
listening
today
find
out
where
your
member
of
congress
stands
on
these
issues
if
they
not
part
of
the
percent
of
americans
who
agree
on
background
checks
then
ask
them
why
not
why
you
want
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
dangerous
criminal
to
get
his
or
her
hands
on
gun
why
you
want
to
close
the
loophole
that
allows
too
many
criminals
to
buy
gun
without
even
the
simplest
of
background
checks
why
on
earth
you
want
to
make
it
easier
rather
than
harder
for
law
enforcement
to
do
their
job
know
that
some
of
the
officers
here
today
know
what
it
like
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
parent
or
grandparent
brother
or
sister
or
spouse
who
has
just
lost
loved
one
to
an
act
of
violence
some
of
those
families
by
the
way
are
here
today
and
as
police
officers
you
know
as
well
as
anybody
there
is
no
magic
solution
to
prevent
every
bad
thing
from
happening
in
the
world
you
still
suit
up
you
put
on
your
badge
put
yourself
at
risk
every
single
day
every
single
day
you
go
to
work
and
you
try
to
do
the
best
you
can
to
protect
the
people
you
sworn
to
protect
and
serve
well
how
can
the
rest
of
us
as
citizens
do
anything
less
if
there
is
just
one
step
we
can
take
to
prevent
more
americans
from
knowing
the
pain
that
some
of
the
families
who
are
here
have
known
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
if
these
reforms
keep
one
person
from
murdering
dozens
of
innocent
children
or
worshippers
or
in
span
of
minutes
is
it
worth
fighting
for
believe
it
is
why
going
to
keep
on
working
going
to
keep
on
giving
it
my
best
efforts
but
going
to
need
your
help
this
is
not
easy
and
be
blunt
lot
of
members
of
congress
this
is
tough
for
them
because
those
who
are
opposed
to
any
form
of
legislation
affecting
guns
they
very
and
they
very
but
it
can
be
done
if
enough
voices
are
heard
so
want
to
thank
all
the
police
officers
who
are
here
for
giving
their
best
efforts
every
single
day
want
to
thank
governor
for
his
outstanding
leadership
want
to
thank
all
the
families
who
are
here
for
your
courage
in
being
willing
to
take
out
of
this
tragedy
something
positive
want
to
thank
the
people
of
for
coming
together
in
sensible
ways

do

on
board
the
mars
rover
originated
at
the
same
time
but
what
most
looked
forward
to
is
the
ability
to
speak
directly
to
you
the
israeli
people
especially
so
many
young
people
who
are
here
today
to
talk
about
the
history
that
brought
us
here
today
and
the
future
that
you
will
make
in
the
years
to
come
now
know
that
in
vibrant
democracy
every
word
every
gesture
is
carefully
but
want
to
clear
something
up
just
so
you
know
any
drama
between
me
and
my
friend
over
the
years
was
just
plot
to
create
material
for
the
only
thing
that
was
going
on
we
just
wanted
to
make
sure
the
writers
had
good
material
also
know
that
come
to
israel
on
the
eve
of
sacred
holiday
the
celebration
of
passover
and
that
is
where
would
like
to
begin
today
just
few
days
from
now
jews
here
in
israel
and
around
the
world
will
sit
with
family
and
friends
at
the
table
and
celebrate
with
songs
wine
and
symbolic
foods
after
enjoying
with
family
and
friends
in
chicago
and
on
the
campaign
trail
proud
that
now
brought
this
tradition
into
the
white
house
did
so
because
wanted
my
daughters
to
experience
the
and
the
story
at
the
of
passover
that
makes
this
time
of
year
so
powerful
story
of
centuries
of
slavery
and
years
of
wandering
in
the
desert
story
of
perseverance
amidst
persecution
and
faith
in
god
and
the
torah
story
about
finding
freedom
in
your
own
land
and
for
the
jewish
people
this
story
is
central
to
who
become
but
also
story
that
holds
within
it
the
universal
human
experience
with
all
of
its
suffering
but
also
all
of
its
salvation
part
of
the
three
great
religions
judaism
and
islam
that
trace
their
origins
to
abraham
and
see
as
sacred
and
story
inspired
communities
across
the
globe
including
me
and
my
fellow
americans
in
the
united
states
nation
made
up
of
people
who
crossed
oceans
to
start
anew
naturally
drawn
to
the
idea
of
finding
freedom
in
our
land
to
african
americans
the
story
of
the
exodus
was
perhaps
the
central
story
the
most
powerful
image
about
emerging
from
the
grip
of
bondage
to
reach
for
liberty
and
human
dignity
tale
that
was
carried
from
slavery
through
the
civil
rights
movement
into
today
for
generations
this
promise
helped
people
weather
poverty
and
persecution
while
holding
on
to
the
hope
that
better
day
was
on
the
horizon
for
me
personally
growing
up
in
parts
of
the
world
and
without
firm
roots
the
story
spoke
to
yearning
within
every
human
being
for
home
of
course
even
as
we
draw
strength
from
the
story
of
will
and
his
gift
of
freedom
expressed
on
passover
we
also
know
that
here
on
earth
we
must
bear
our
responsibilities
in
an
imperfect
world
that
means
accepting
our
measure
of
sacrifice
and
struggle
just
like
previous
generations
it
means
us
working
through
generation
after
generation
on
behalf
of
that
ideal
of
freedom
as
martin
luther
king
said
on
the
day
before
he
was
killed
may
not
get
there
with
you
but
want
you
to
know
that
we
as
people
will
get
to
the
promised
so
just
as
joshua
carried
on
after
moses
the
work
goes
on
for
all
of
you
the
joshua
generation
for
justice
and
dignity
for
opportunity
and
freedom
for
the
jewish
people
the
journey
to
the
promise
of
the
state
of
israel
wound
through
countless
generations
it
involved
centuries
of
suffering
and
exile
prejudice
and
pogroms
and
even
genocide
through
it
all
the
jewish
people
sustained
their
unique
identity
and
traditions
as
well
as
longing
to
return
home
and
while
jews
achieved
extraordinary
success
in
many
parts
of
the
world
the
dream
of
true
freedom
finally
found
its
full
expression
in
the
zionist
idea
to
be
free
people
in
your
homeland
why
believe
that
israel
is
rooted
not
just
in
history
and
tradition
but
also
in
simple
and
profound
idea
the
idea
that
people
deserve
to
be
free
in
land
of
their
own
over
the
last
years
when
israel
has
been
at
its
best
israelis
have
demonstrated
that
responsibility
does
not
end
when
you
reach
the
promised
land
it
only
begins
and
so
israel
has
been
refuge
for
the
diaspora
welcoming
jews
from
europe
from
the
former
soviet
union
from
ethiopia
from
north
africa
israel
has
built
prosperous
nation
through
that
made
the
desert
bloom
business
that
broadened
the
middle
class
innovators
who
reached
new
frontiers
from
the
smallest
microchip
to
the
orbits
of
space
israel
has
established
thriving
democracy
with
spirited
civil
society
and
proud
political
parties
and
tireless
free
press
and
lively
public
debate
may
even
be
an
understatement
and
israel
has
achieved
all
this
even
as
overcome
relentless
threats
to
its
security
through
the
courage
of
the
israel
forces
and
the
citizenry
that
is
so
resilient
in
the
face
of
terror
this
is
the
story
of
israel
this
is
the
work
that
has
brought
the
dreams
of
so
many
generations
to
life
and
every
step
of
the
way
israel
has
built
unbreakable
bonds
of
friendship
with
my
country
the
united
states
of
america
those
ties
began
only
minutes
after
israeli
independence
when
the
united
states
was
the
first
nation
to
the
state
of
israel
as
president
said
in
explaining
his
decision
to
israel
he
said
believe
it
has
glorious
future
before
it
not
just
as
another
sovereign
nation
but
as
an
embodiment
of
the
great
ideals
of
our
and
since
then
built
friendship
that
advances
our
shared
interests
together
we
share
commitment
to
security
for
our
citizens
and
the
stability
of
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
together
we
share
focus
on
advancing
economic
growth
around
the
globe
and
strengthening
the
middle
class
within
our
own
countries
together
we
share
stake
in
the
success
of
democracy
but
the
source
of
our
friendship
extends
beyond
mere
interests
just
as
it
has
transcended
political
parties
and
individual
leaders
america
is
nation
of
immigrants
america
is
strengthened
by
diversity
america
is
enriched
by
faith
we
are
governed
not
simply
by
men
and
women
but
by
laws
we
by
entrepreneurship
and
innovation
and
we
are
defined
by
democratic
discourse
that
allows
each
generation
to
and
renew
our
union
once
more
so
in
israel
we
see
values
that
we
share
even
as
we
what
makes
us
different
that
is
an
essential
part
of
our
bond
now
stand
here
today
mindful
that
for
both
our
nations
these
are
some
complicated
times
we
have
difficult
issues
to
work
through
within
our
own
countries
and
we
face
dangers
and
upheaval
around
the
world
and
when
look
at
young
people
within
the
united
states
think
about
the
choices
that
they
must
make
in
their
lives
to
define
who
we
be
as
nation
in
this
century
particularly
as
we
emerge
from
two
wars
and
the
worst
recession
since
the
great
depression
but
part
of
the
reason
like
talking
to
young
people
is
because
no
matter
how
great
the
challenges
are
their
idealism
their
energy
their
ambition
always
gives
me
hope
and
see
the
same
spirit
in
the
young
people
here
today
believe
that
you
will
shape
our
future
and
given
the
ties
between
our
countries
believe
your
future
is
bound
to
ours
no
no
this
is
part
of
the
lively
debate
that
we
talked
about
this
is
good
you
know
have
to
say
we
actually
arranged
for
that
because
it
made
me
feel
at
home
feel
comfortable
if
did
have
at
least
one
heckler
like
to
focus
on
how
we
and
when
say
we
in
particular
young
people
can
work
together
to
make
progress
in
three
areas
that
will
define
our
times
security
peace
and
prosperity
let
me
begin
with
security
proud
that
the
security
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
israel
has
never
been
stronger
never
more
exercises
between
our
more
exchanges
among
our
political
and
military
and
intelligence
officials
than
ever
before
the
largest
program
to
date
to
help
you
retain
your
qualitative
military
edge
these
are
the
facts
these
are
my
opinions
these
are
facts
but
to
me
this
is
not
simply
measured
on
balance
sheet
know
that
here
in
israel
security
is
something
personal
here
what
think
about
when
consider
these
issues
when
consider
security
think
about
children
like
who
met
in
children
the
same
age
as
my
own
daughters
who
went
to
bed
at
night
fearful
that
rocket
would
land
in
their
bedroom
simply
because
of
who
they
are
and
where
they
live
that
reality
is
why
invested
in
the
iron
dome
system
to
save
countless
lives
because
those
children
deserve
to
sleep
better
at
night
why
made
it
clear
time
and
again
that
israel
can
not
accept
rocket
attacks
from
and
we
have
stood
up
for
right
to
defend
itself
and
why
israel
has
right
to
expect
to
renounce
violence
and
right
to
exist
when
think
about
security
think
about
five
israelis
who
boarded
bus
in
bulgaria
who
were
blown
up
because
of
where
they
came
from
robbed
of
the
ability
to
live
and
love
and
raise
families
why
every
country
that
values
justice
should
call
what
it
truly
is
terrorist
because
the
world
can
not
tolerate
an
that
murders
innocent
civilians
stockpiles
rockets
to
shoot
at
cities
and
supports
the
massacre
of
men
and
women
and
children
in
syria
right
now
the
fact
that
ally
the
regime
has
stockpiles
of
chemical
weapons
only
heightens
the
urgency
we
will
continue
to
cooperate
closely
to
guard
against
that
danger
made
it
clear
to
and
all
who
follow
his
orders
we
will
not
tolerate
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
against
the
syrian
people
or
the
transfer
of
those
weapons
to
terrorists
the
world
is
watching
we
will
hold
you
accountable
the
syrian
people
have
the
right
to
be
freed
from
the
grip
of
dictator
who
would
rather
kill
his
own
people
than
relinquish
power
must
go
so
that
future
can
begin
because
true
stability
in
syria
depends
upon
establishing
government
that
is
responsible
to
its
people
one
that
protects
all
communities
within
its
borders
while
making
peace
with
countries
beyond
them
these
are
the
things
think
about
when
think
about
security
when
consider
security
also
think
about
people
who
have
living
memory
of
the
holocaust
faced
with
the
prospect
of
iranian
government
that
has
called
for
destruction
no
wonder
israelis
view
this
as
an
existential
threat
but
this
is
not
simply
challenge
for
israel
it
is
danger
for
the
entire
world
including
the
united
states
iran
would
raise
the
risk
of
nuclear
terrorism
it
would
undermine
the
regime
it
would
spark
an
arms
race
in
volatile
region
and
it
would
embolden
government
that
has
shown
no
respect
for
the
rights
of
its
own
people
or
the
responsibilities
of
nations
why
america
has
built
coalition
to
increase
the
cost
to
iran
of
failing
to
meet
their
obligations
the
iranian
government
is
now
under
more
pressure
than
ever
before
and
that
pressure
is
increasing
it
is
isolated
its
economy
is
in
dire
straits
its
leadership
is
divided
and
its
position
in
the
region
and
the
world
has
only
grown
weaker
do
believe
that
all
of
us
have
an
interest
in
resolving
this
issue
peacefully
strong
and
principled
diplomacy
is
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
the
iranian
government
forsakes
nuclear
weapons
peace
is
far
more
preferable
to
war
and
the
inevitable
costs
the
unintended
consequences
that
would
come
with
war
means
that
we
have
to
do
everything
we
can
to
try
to
resolve
this
diplomatically
because
of
the
cooperation
between
our
governments
we
know
that
there
remains
time
to
pursue
diplomatic
resolution
what
america
will
do
with
clear
eyes
working
with
world
united
and
with
the
sense
of
urgency
required
but
iran
must
know
this
time
is
not
unlimited
and
made
the
position
of
the
united
states
of
america
clear
iran
must
not
get
nuclear
weapon
this
is
not
danger
that
can
be
contained
and
as
president
said
all
options
are
on
the
table
for
achieving
our
objectives
america
will
do
what
we
must
to
prevent
iran
for
young
israelis
know
that
these
issues
of
security
are
rooted
in
an
experience
that
is
even
more
fundamental
than
the
pressing
threat
of
the
day
you
live
in
where
many
of
your
have
rejected
the
right
of
your
nation
to
exist
your
grandparents
had
to
risk
their
lives
and
all
that
they
had
to
make
place
for
themselves
in
this
world
your
parents
lived
through
war
after
war
to
ensure
the
survival
of
the
jewish
state
your
children
grow
up
knowing
that
people
never
met
may
hate
them
because
of
who
they
are
in
region
that
is
full
of
turmoil
and
changing
underneath
your
feet
so
what
think
about
when
israel
is
faced
with
these
challenges
that
sense
of
an
israel
that
is
surrounded
by
many
in
this
region
who
still
reject
it
and
many
in
the
world
who
refuse
to
accept
it
and
why
the
security
of
the
jewish
people
in
israel
is
so
important
it
can
not
be
taken
for
granted
but
make
no
mistake
those
who
adhere
to
the
ideology
of
rejecting
right
to
exist
they
might
as
well
reject
the
earth
beneath
them
or
the
sky
above
because
israel
is
not
going
anywhere
and
today
want
to
tell
you
particularly
the
young
people
so
that
there
no
mistake
here
so
long
as
there
is
united
states
of
america
you
are
not
alone
the
question
is
what
kind
of
future
israel
will
look
forward
to
israel
is
not
going
anywhere
but
especially
for
the
young
people
in
this
audience
the
question
is
what
does
its
future
hold
and
that
brings
me
to
the
subject
of
peace
know
israel
has
taken
risks
for
peace
brave
leaders
begin
reached
treaties
with
two
of
your
you
made
credible
proposals
to
the
at
you
withdrew
from
and
lebanon
and
then
faced
terror
and
rockets
across
the
region
extended
hand
of
friendship
and
all
too
often
been
confronted
with
rejection
and
in
some
cases
the
ugly
reality
of
so
believe
that
the
israeli
people
do
want
peace
and
also
understand
why
too
many
israelis
maybe
an
increasing
number
maybe
lot
of
young
people
here
today
are
that
it
can
be
achieved
but
today
israel
is
at
crossroads
it
can
be
tempting
to
put
aside
the
frustrations
and
sacrifices
that
come
with
the
pursuit
of
peace
particularly
when
iron
dome
repels
rockets
barriers
keep
out
suicide
bombers
there
so
many
other
pressing
issues
that
demand
your
attention
and
know
that
only
israelis
can
make
the
fundamental
decisions
about
your
future
that
also
know
by
the
way
that
not
everyone
in
this
hall
will
agree
with
what
have
to
say
about
peace
that
there
are
those
who
are
not
simply
about
peace
but
question
its
underlying
premise
have
different
vision
for
israel
future
and
part
of
democracy
that
part
of
the
discourse
between
our
two
countries
that
but
also
believe
it
important
to
be
open
and
honest
especially
with
your
friends
also
believe
that
politically
given
the
strong
bipartisan
support
for
israel
in
america
the
easiest
thing
for
me
to
do
would
be
to
put
this
issue
aside
just
express
unconditional
support
for
whatever
israel
decides
to
do
that
would
be
the
easiest
political
path
but
want
you
to
know
that
speak
to
you
as
friend
who
is
deeply
concerned
and
committed
to
your
future
and
ask
you
to
consider
three
points
first
peace
is
necessary
believe
that
believe
that
peace
is
the
only
path
to
true
security
you
have
the
opportunity
to
be
the
generation
that
permanently
secures
the
zionist
dream
or
you
can
face
growing
challenge
to
its
future
given
the
demographics
west
of
the
river
the
only
way
for
israel
to
endure
and
thrive
as
jewish
and
democratic
state
is
through
the
of
an
independent
and
viable
that
is
true
there
are
other
factors
involved
given
the
frustration
in
the
international
community
about
this
conflict
israel
needs
to
reverse
an
of
isolation
and
given
the
march
of
technology
the
only
way
to
truly
protect
the
israeli
people
over
the
long
term
is
through
the
absence
of
war
because
no
wall
is
high
enough
and
no
iron
dome
is
strong
enough
or
perfect
enough
to
stop
every
enemy
that
is
intent
on
doing
so
from
inflicting
harm
and
this
truth
is
more
pronounced
given
the
changes
sweeping
the
arab
world
understand
that
with
the
uncertainty
in
the
region
people
in
the
streets
changes
in
leadership
the
rise
of
parties
in
politics
it
tempting
to
turn
inward
because
the
situation
outside
of
israel
seems
so
chaotic
but
this
is
precisely
the
time
to
respond
to
the
wave
of
revolution
with
resolve
and
commitment
for
peace
because
as
more
governments
respond
to
popular
will
the
days
when
israel
could
seek
peace
simply
with
handful
of
autocratic
leaders
those
days
are
over
peace
will
have
to
be
made
among
peoples
not
just
governments
no
one
no
single
step
can
change
overnight
what
lies
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
millions
no
single
step
is
going
to
erase
years
of
history
and
propaganda
but
progress
with
the
is
powerful
way
to
begin
while
extremists
who
thrive
on
conflict
and
thrive
on
division
it
would
make
difference
so
peace
is
necessary
but
peace
is
also
just
peace
is
also
just
there
is
no
question
that
israel
has
faced
factions
who
turned
to
terror
leaders
who
missed
historic
opportunities
that
is
all
true
and
why
security
must
be
at
the
of
any
agreement
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
only
path
to
peace
is
through
negotiations
which
is
why
despite
the
criticism
received
the
united
states
will
oppose
unilateral
efforts
to
bypass
negotiations
through
the
united
nations
it
has
to
be
done
by
the
parties
but
the
right
to
their
right
to
justice
must
also
be
put
yourself
in
their
shoes
look
at
the
world
through
their
eyes
it
is
not
fair
that
child
can
not
grow
up
in
state
of
their
own
living
their
entire
lives
with
the
presence
of
foreign
army
that
controls
the
movements
not
just
of
those
young
people
but
their
parents
their
grandparents
every
single
day
not
just
when
settler
violence
against
goes
unpunished
not
right
to
prevent
from
farming
their
lands
or
restricting
ability
to
move
around
the
west
bank
or
displace
families
from
their
homes
neither
occupation
nor
expulsion
is
the
answer
just
as
israelis
built
state
in
their
homeland
have
right
to
be
free
people
in
their
own
land
going
off
script
here
for
second
but
before
came
here
met
with
group
of
young
from
the
age
of
to
and
talking
to
them
they
that
different
from
my
daughters
they
that
different
from
your
daughters
or
sons
honestly
believe
that
if
any
israeli
parent
sat
down
with
those
kids
say
want
these
kids
to
succeed
want
them
to
prosper
want
them
to
have
opportunities
just
like
my
kids
do
believe
what
israeli
parents
would
want
for
these
kids
if
they
had
chance
to
listen
to
them
and
talk
to
them
believe
that
now
only
you
can
determine
what
kind
of
democracy
you
will
have
but
remember
that
as
you
make
these
decisions
you
will
define
not
simply
the
future
of
your
relationship
with
the
you
will
define
the
future
of
israel
as
well
as
said
quoting
him
is
impossible
to
have
jewish
democratic
state
at
the
same
time
to
control
all
of
israel
if
we
insist
on
fulfilling
the
dream
in
its
entirety
we
are
liable
to
lose
it
or
from
different
perspective
think
of
what
the
novelist
david
said
shortly
after
losing
his
son
as
he
described
the
necessity
of
peace
peace
of
no
he
said
be
approached
with
the
same
determination
and
creativity
as
one
approaches
war
of
no
now
israel
can
not
be
expected
to
negotiate
with
anyone
who
is
dedicated
to
its
destruction
but
while
know
you
have
had
differences
with
the
authority
genuinely
believe
that
you
do
have
true
partner
in
president
and
prime
minister
believe
that
and
they
have
track
record
to
prove
it
over
the
last
few
years
they
have
built
institutions
and
maintained
security
on
the
west
bank
in
ways
that
few
could
have
imagined
just
few
years
ago
so
many
including
young
people
have
rejected
violence
as
means
of
achieving
their
aspirations
there
is
an
opportunity
there
window
which
brings
me
to
my
third
point
peace
is
possible
it
is
possible
not
saying
it
guaranteed
even
say
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
but
it
is
possible
know
it
seem
that
way
there
are
always
going
to
be
reasons
to
avoid
risk
there
are
costs
for
failure
there
will
always
be
extremists
who
provide
an
excuse
not
to
act
know
there
must
be
something
exhausting
about
endless
talks
about
talks
and
daily
controversies
and
just
the
grinding
status
and
sure
there
temptation
just
to
say
enough
let
me
focus
on
my
small
corner
of
the
world
and
my
family
and
my
job
and
what
can
but
it
possible
negotiations
will
be
necessary
but
there
little
secret
about
where
they
must
lead
two
states
for
two
peoples
two
states
for
two
peoples
there
will
be
differences
about
how
to
get
there
there
are
going
to
be
hard
choices
along
the
way
arab
states
must
adapt
to
world
that
has
changed
the
days
when
they
could
condemn
israel
to
distract
their
people
from
lack
of
opportunity
or
government
corruption
or
mismanagement
those
days
need
to
be
over
now
is
the
time
for
the
arab
world
to
take
steps
toward
relations
with
israel
meanwhile
must
that
israel
will
be
jewish
state
and
that
israelis
have
the
right
to
insist
upon
their
security
israelis
must
that
continued
settlement
activity
is
counterproductive
to
the
cause
of
peace
and
that
an
independent
must
be
viable
with
real
borders
that
have
to
be
drawn
suggested
principles
on
territory
and
security
that
believe
can
be
the
basis
for
these
talks
but
for
the
moment
put
aside
the
plans
and
the
process
ask
you
instead
to
think
about
what
can
be
done
to
build
trust
between
people
four
years
ago
stood
in
cairo
in
front
of
an
audience
of
young
people
politically
religiously
they
must
seem
world
away
but
the
things
they
want
not
so
different
from
what
the
young
people
here
want
they
want
the
ability
to
make
their
own
decisions
and
to
get
an
education
get
good
job
to
worship
god
in
their
own
way
to
get
married
to
raise
family
the
same
is
true
of
those
young
that
met
with
this
morning
the
same
is
true
for
young
who
yearn
for
better
life
in
that
where
peace
begins
not
just
in
the
plans
of
leaders
but
in
the
hearts
of
people
not
just
in
some
carefully
designed
process
but
in
the
daily
connections
that
sense
of
empathy
that
takes
place
among
those
who
live
together
in
this
land
and
in
this
sacred
city
of
and
let
me
say
this
as
politician
can
promise
you
this
political
leaders
will
never
take
risks
if
the
people
do
not
push
them
to
take
some
risks
you
must
create
the
change
that
you
want
to
see
ordinary
people
can
accomplish
extraordinary
things
know
this
is
possible
look
to
the
bridges
being
built
in
business
and
civil
society
by
some
of
you
here
today
look
at
the
young
people
not
yet
learned
reason
to
mistrust
or
those
young
people
learned
to
overcome
legacy
of
mistrust
that
they
inherited
from
their
parents
because
they
simply
that
we
hold
more
hopes
in
common
than
fears
that
drive
us
apart
your
voices
must
be
louder
than
those
who
would
drown
out
hope
your
hopes
must
light
the
way
forward
look
to
future
in
which
jews
and
muslims
and
can
all
live
in
peace
and
greater
prosperity
in
this
holy
land
believe
in
that
and
most
of
all
look
to
the
future
that
you
want
for
your
own
children
future
in
which
jewish
democratic
vibrant
state
is
protected
and
accepted
for
this
time
and
for
all
time
there
will
be
many
who
say
this
change
is
not
possible
but
remember
this
israel
is
the
most
powerful
country
in
this
region
israel
has
the
unshakeable
support
of
the
most
powerful
country
in
the
world
israel
is
not
going
anywhere
israel
has
the
wisdom
to
see
the
world
as
it
is
but
this
is
in
your
nature
israel
also
has
the
courage
to
see
the
world
as
it
should
be
ben
once
said
israel
in
order
to
be
realist
you
must
believe
in
sometimes
the
greatest
miracle
is
that
the
world
can
change
that
lesson
that
the
world
has
learned
from
the
jewish
people
and
that
brings
me
to
the
final
area
that
focus
on
prosperity
and
broader
role
in
the
world
know
that
all
the
talk
about
security
and
peace
can
sometimes
seem
to
dominate
the
headlines
but
that
not
where
people
live
and
every
day
even
amidst
the
threats
that
you
face
israelis
are
defining
themselves
by
the
opportunities
that
you
creating
through
talent
and
hard
work
israelis
have
put
this
small
country
at
the
forefront
of
the
global
economy
israelis
understand
the
value
of
education
and
have
produced
understand
the
power
of
invention
and
your
universities
educate
engineers
and
inventors
and
that
spirit
has
led
to
economic
growth
and
human
progress
solar
power
and
electric
cars
bandages
and
prosthetic
limbs
that
save
lives
stem
cell
research
and
new
drugs
that
treat
disease
cell
phones
and
computer
technology
that
changed
the
way
people
around
the
world
live
so
if
people
want
to
see
the
future
of
the
world
economy
they
should
look
at
home
to
hundreds
of
and
research
israelis
are
so
active
on
social
media
that
every
day
seemed
to
bring
different
campaign
about
where
should
give
this
that
innovation
is
just
as
important
to
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
israel
as
our
security
cooperation
our
first
free
trade
agreement
in
the
world
was
reached
with
israel
nearly
three
decades
ago
today
the
trade
between
our
two
countries
is
at
billion
every
year
more
importantly
that
partnership
is
creating
new
products
and
medical
treatments
pushing
new
frontiers
of
science
and
exploration
the
kind
of
relationship
that
israel
should
have
and
could
have
with
every
country
in
the
world
already
we
see
how
that
innovation
could
reshape
this
region
program
here
in
that
brings
together
young
israelis
and
to
learn
vital
skills
in
technology
and
business
an
israeli
and
have
started
venture
capital
fund
to
finance
over
companies
have
found
home
on
the
west
bank
which
speaks
to
the
talent
and
entrepreneurial
spirit
of
the
people
one
of
the
great
ironies
of
happening
in
the
broader
region
is
that
so
much
of
what
people
are
yearning
for
education
entrepreneurship
the
ability
to
start
business
without
paying
bribe
the
ability
to
connect
to
the
global
economy
those
are
things
that
can
be
found
here
in
israel
this
should
be
hub
for
thriving
regional
trade
and
an
engine
for
opportunity
israel
is
already
for
innovation
that
helps
power
the
global
economy
and
believe
that
all
of
that
potential
for
prosperity
can
be
enhanced
with
greater
security
enhanced
with
lasting
peace
here
in
this
small
strip
of
land
that
has
been
the
of
so
much
of
the
history
so
much
triumph
and
so
much
tragedy
israelis
have
built
something
that
few
could
have
imagined
years
ago
tomorrow
will
pay
tribute
to
that
history
at
the
grave
of
man
who
had
the
foresight
to
see
the
future
of
the
jewish
people
had
to
be
reconnected
to
their
past
at
the
grave
of
who
understood
that
victories
in
war
had
to
be
followed
by
the
battles
for
peace
at
where
the
world
is
reminded
of
the
cloud
of
evil
that
can
descend
on
the
jewish
people
and
all
of
humanity
if
we
ever
fail
to
be
vigilant
we
bear
all
that
history
on
our
shoulders
we
carry
all
that
history
in
our
hearts
today
as
we
face
the
twilight
of
founding
generation
you
the
young
people
of
israel
must
now
claim
its
future
it
falls
to
you
to
write
the
next
chapter
in
the
great
story
of
this
great
nation
and
as
the
president
of
country
that
you
can
count
on
as
your
greatest
friend
am
confident
that
you
can
help
us
find
the
promise
in
the
days
that
lie
ahead
and
as
man
been
inspired
in
my
own
life
by
that
timeless
calling
within
the
jewish
experience
am
hopeful
that
we
can
draw
upon
best
in
ourselves
to
meet
the
challenges
that
will
come
to
win
the
battles
for
peace
in
the
wake
of
so
much
war
and
to
do
the
work
of
repairing
this
world
your
job
my
job
the
task
of
all
of
us
may
god
bless
you
may
god
bless
israel
may
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
speaker
leader
leader
leader
assistant
leader
to
the
friends
and
family
of
parks
to
the
distinguished
guests
who
are
gathered
here
today
this
morning
we
celebrate
seamstress
slight
in
stature
but
mighty
in
courage
she
defied
the
odds
and
she
defied
injustice
she
lived
life
of
activism
but
also
life
of
dignity
and
grace
and
in
single
moment
with
the
simplest
of
gestures
she
helped
change
america
and
change
the
world
parks
held
no
elected
office
she
possessed
no
fortune
lived
her
life
far
from
the
formal
seats
of
power
and
yet
today
she
takes
her
rightful
place
among
those
shaped
this
course
thank
all
those
persons
in
particular
the
members
of
the
congressional
black
caucus
both
past
and
present
for
making
this
moment
possible
childhood
friend
once
said
about
mrs
parks
ever
bossed
around
and
got
away
with
what
an
alabama
driver
learned
on
december
twelve
years
earlier
he
had
kicked
mrs
parks
off
his
bus
simply
because
she
entered
through
the
front
door
when
the
back
door
was
too
crowded
he
grabbed
her
sleeve
and
he
pushed
her
off
the
bus
it
made
her
mad
enough
she
would
recall
that
she
avoided
riding
his
bus
for
while
and
when
they
met
again
that
winter
evening
in
parks
would
not
be
pushed
when
the
driver
got
up
from
his
seat
to
insist
that
she
give
up
hers
she
would
not
be
pushed
when
he
threatened
to
have
her
arrested
she
simply
replied
may
do
and
he
did
few
days
later
parks
challenged
her
arrest
pastor
new
to
town
and
only
years
old
stood
with
her
man
named
martin
luther
king
so
did
thousands
of
alabama
commuters
they
began
boycott
teachers
and
clergy
and
domestics
through
rain
and
cold
and
sweltering
heat
day
after
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
walking
miles
if
they
had
to
arranging
where
they
could
not
thinking
about
the
blisters
on
their
feet
the
weariness
after
full
day
of
work
walking
for
respect
walking
for
freedom
driven
by
solemn
determination
to
affirm
their
dignity
three
hundred
and
days
after
parks
refused
to
give
up
her
seat
the
boycott
ended
black
men
and
women
and
children
the
buses
of
newly
and
sat
in
whatever
seat
happen
to
be
open
and
with
that
victory
the
entire
edifice
of
segregation
like
the
ancient
walls
of
jericho
began
to
slowly
come
tumbling
down
been
often
remarked
that
activism
begin
on
that
bus
long
before
she
made
headlines
she
had
stood
up
for
freedom
stood
up
for
equality
fighting
for
voting
rights
rallying
against
discrimination
in
the
criminal
justice
system
serving
in
the
local
chapter
of
the
her
quiet
leadership
would
continue
long
after
she
became
an
icon
of
the
civil
rights
movement
working
with
congressman
to
find
homes
for
the
homeless
preparing
disadvantaged
youth
for
path
to
success
striving
each
day
to
right
some
wrong
somewhere
in
this
world
and
yet
our
minds
fasten
on
that
single
moment
on
the
bus
ms
parks
alone
in
that
seat
clutching
her
purse
staring
out
window
waiting
to
be
arrested
that
moment
tells
us
something
about
how
change
happens
or
happen
the
choices
we
make
or
make
now
we
see
through
glass
darkly
scripture
says
and
true
whether
out
of
inertia
or
selfishness
whether
out
of
fear
or
simple
lack
of
moral
imagination
we
so
often
spend
our
lives
as
if
in
fog
accepting
injustice
inequity
tolerating
the
intolerable
like
the
bus
driver
but
also
like
the
passengers
on
the
bus
we
see
the
way
things
are
children
hungry
in
land
of
plenty
entire
ravaged
by
violence
families
hobbled
by
job
loss
or
illness
and
we
make
excuses
for
inaction
and
we
say
to
ourselves
that
not
my
responsibility
nothing
can
do
parks
tell
us
always
something
we
can
do
she
tells
us
that
we
all
have
responsibilities
to
ourselves
and
to
one
another
she
reminds
us
that
this
is
how
change
happens
not
mainly
through
the
exploits
of
the
famous
and
the
powerful
but
through
the
countless
acts
of
often
anonymous
courage
and
kindness
and
fellow
feeling
and
responsibility
that
continually
stubbornly
expand
our
conception
of
justice
our
conception
of
what
is
possible
singular
act
of
disobedience
launched
movement
the
tired
feet
of
those
who
walked
the
dusty
roads
of
helped
nation
see
that
to
which
it
had
once
been
blind
it
is
because
of
these
men
and
women
that
stand
here
today
it
is
because
of
them
that
our
children
grow
up
in
land
more
free
and
more
fair
land
truer
to
its
founding
creed
and
that
is
why
this
statue
belongs
in
this
hall
to
remind
us
no
matter
how
humble
or
lofty
our
positions
just
what
it
is
that
leadership
requires
just
what
it
is
that
citizenship
requires
parks
would
have
turned
years
old
this
month
we
do
well
by
placing
statue
of
her
here
but
we
can
do
no
greater
to
her
memory
than
to
carry
forward
the
power
of
her
principle
and
courage
born
of
conviction
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
parks
and
may
god
bless
these
united
states
of
america
hello
news
well
it
is
good
to
see
all
of
you
here
today
want
to
thank
your
mike
for
showing
me
around
usually
get
chance
to
hang
out
with
nuclear
submarines
especially
submarines
that
my
wife
has
sponsored
so
right
there
that
was
worth
the
trip
but
most
importantly
great
chance
to
see
the
incredible
men
and
women
who
every
single
day
are
helping
to
keep
america
safe
and
are
just
the
bedrock
of
this
manufacturing
base
thank
you
to
all
of
you
want
to
thank
our
outstanding
secretary
of
the
navy
ray
here
there
he
is
right
there
the
guy
over
at
the
end
want
to
thank
your
mayor
price
who
served
this
nation
bravely
in
the
army
want
to
thank
two
outstanding
congressmen
who
care
about
this
facility
care
about
virginia
and
care
about
the
country
congressman
bobby
is
here
and
congressman
is
here
as
well
now
the
reason
came
here
today
in
addition
to
seeing
just
some
incredible
stuff
true
every
time
come
to
these
places
do
know
how
you
all
do
it
it
is
just
amazing
work
but
the
main
reason
here
is
to
call
attention
to
the
important
work
that
doing
on
behalf
of
the
and
to
let
the
american
people
know
that
this
work
along
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
are
currently
in
jeopardy
because
of
politics
in
washington
in
few
days
congress
might
allow
series
of
immediate
painful
arbitrary
budget
cuts
to
take
place
known
in
washington
as
the
now
that
pretty
bad
name
but
the
effects
are
even
worse
than
the
name
instead
of
cutting
out
the
government
spending
we
need
wasteful
programs
that
do
work
special
interest
tax
loopholes
and
tax
breaks
what
the
does
is
it
uses
meat
cleaver
approach
to
gut
critical
investments
in
things
like
education
and
national
security
and
lifesaving
medical
research
and
the
impact
of
this
policy
be
felt
overnight
but
it
will
be
real
the
will
weaken
economic
recovery
it
will
weaken
our
military
readiness
and
it
will
weaken
the
basic
services
that
the
american
people
depend
on
every
single
day
already
the
uncertainty
around
these
cuts
is
having
an
effect
companies
are
starting
to
prepare
for
layoff
notices
families
are
preparing
to
cut
back
on
expenses
and
the
longer
these
cuts
are
in
place
the
greater
the
damage
so
here
at
news
shipbuilding
you
guys
have
made
an
enormous
investment
because
we
said
in
order
to
maintain
the
finest
navy
that
the
world
has
ever
known
we
got
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
orderly
process
whereby
we
are
continually
upgrading
our
ships
building
new
ships
maintaining
our
ships
properly
and
these
are
some
big
ships
so
expensive
and
complicated
and
got
suppliers
all
across
the
country
and
you
got
to
have
some
certainty
and
some
knowledge
about
how
things
are
going
to
proceed
over
the
long
term
for
mike
and
others
to
plan
properly
so
you
rightly
concerned
mike
is
properly
concerned
about
the
impact
that
these
cuts
will
have
on
not
just
this
company
but
companies
and
small
businesses
from
all
states
that
supply
you
with
parts
and
equipment
mike
was
telling
me
that
you
guys
have
already
made
billion
worth
of
capital
investment
you
got
half
billion
dollars
in
training
costs
as
you
recruit
and
hire
new
people
well
those
are
commitments
that
you
make
lightly
you
got
to
have
the
capacity
to
plan
and
have
some
certainty
in
terms
of
what
it
is
that
we
going
to
be
doing
and
you
know
that
if
congress
get
together
and
plan
our
finances
for
the
long
term
that
over
time
some
of
your
jobs
and
businesses
could
be
at
risk
over
at
the
naval
station
the
threat
of
these
cuts
has
already
forced
the
navy
to
cancel
the
deployment
or
delay
the
repair
of
certain
aircraft
carriers
one
currently
being
built
might
not
get
finished
another
carrier
might
not
get
started
at
all
and
that
hurts
your
bottom
line
that
hurts
this
community
because
of
these
automatic
cuts
about
who
work
for
the
department
of
would
be
forced
to
take
unpaid
leave
from
their
jobs
so
money
out
of
their
pockets
money
out
of
their
and
then
that
means
going
to
be
ripple
effect
on
thousands
of
other
jobs
and
businesses
and
services
throughout
the
commonwealth
because
if
they
have
money
in
their
pockets
or
less
money
in
their
pockets
that
means
they
less
able
to
afford
to
buy
goods
and
services
from
other
businesses
so
it
not
just
restricted
to
the
industry
all
told
the
could
cost
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
right
here
in
virginia
but
it
just
stop
there
if
the
goes
into
effect
more
than
college
students
would
lose
their
financial
aid
early
education
like
head
start
and
early
start
would
be
eliminated
for
nearly
children
and
around
fewer
would
get
the
skills
and
training
they
need
to
find
job
across
the
country
these
cuts
will
force
federal
prosecutors
to
close
cases
and
potentially
let
criminals
go
air
traffic
controllers
and
airport
security
will
see
cutbacks
and
that
could
cause
delays
at
airports
across
the
country
tens
of
thousands
of
parents
will
have
to
scramble
to
find
child
care
for
their
kids
hundreds
of
thousands
of
americans
will
lose
access
to
primary
care
and
preventive
care
like
vaccinations
and
cancer
screenings
including
more
than
children
right
here
in
virginia
so
these
cuts
are
wrong
not
smart
not
fair
wound
that
have
to
happen
now
the
reason
that
we
even
thinking
about
the
is
because
people
are
rightly
concerned
about
the
deficit
and
the
debt
but
there
is
sensible
way
of
doing
things
and
there
is
dumb
way
of
doing
things
mean
think
about
your
own
family
let
say
that
suddenly
you
got
little
less
money
coming
in
are
you
going
to
say
well
we
cut
out
college
tuition
for
the
kid
we
stop
feeding
the
little
guy
over
here
we
pay
our
car
note
even
though
that
means
we
get
to
work
not
what
you
do
right
you
step
back
and
you
say
what
is
it
that
important
our
child
education
making
sure
they
healthy
making
sure
we
can
get
to
the
job
keeping
our
house
repaired
and
then
you
say
here
are
the
things
that
are
so
important
and
you
cut
those
out
you
and
you
make
smart
decisions
well
we
should
be
doing
the
same
thing
now
laid
out
plan
that
details
how
we
can
pay
down
our
deficit
in
way
balanced
and
responsible
we
have
the
plan
right
on
website
the
white
house
website
everybody
can
go
see
it
it
details
exactly
how
we
can
cut
programs
that
do
work
how
we
can
raise
money
by
closing
loopholes
that
are
only
serving
few
as
opposed
to
the
average
american
we
detailed
billion
in
sensible
spending
cuts
that
willing
to
make
and
billion
in
wasteful
tax
loopholes
and
deductions
that
willing
to
eliminate
through
tax
reform
and
what
said
is
if
the
republicans
in
congress
like
every
detail
of
my
proposal
which
do
expect
them
to
told
them
my
door
is
open
am
more
than
willing
to
negotiate
want
to
compromise
there
no
reason
why
we
come
together
and
find
sensible
way
to
reduce
the
deficit
over
the
long
term
without
affecting
vital
services
without
hurting
families
without
impacting
outstanding
facilities
like
this
one
and
our
national
there
way
of
doing
this
and
the
fact
is
there
are
leaders
in
both
parties
throughout
this
country
who
want
to
do
the
same
got
to
give
credit
he
is
one
of
your
republican
congressmen
with
us
here
today
and
that
not
always
healthy
for
republican
being
with
me
but
the
reason
doing
it
is
because
he
knows
it
important
to
you
and
asked
his
colleagues
in
the
house
to
consider
closing
tax
loopholes
instead
of
letting
these
automatic
cuts
go
through
concerned
about
the
deficit
and
more
than
prepared
to
make
some
really
tough
cuts
but
he
wants
to
do
it
in
smart
way
bobby
same
thing
some
of
the
cuts
we
proposed
bobby
might
not
think
are
perfect
but
he
knows
that
we
got
to
make
some
tough
decisions
he
just
wants
to
make
sure
that
you
are
the
ones
who
are
adversely
impacted
and
that
we
sharing
the
sacrifice
in
bringing
down
our
deficit
we
not
just
dumping
it
on
few
people
and
we
not
doing
it
in
dumb
way
senators
like
john
have
made
similar
statements
to
what
said
your
republican
governor
along
with
other
governors
around
the
country
have
said
they
want
congress
to
stop
the
to
stop
these
cuts
but
just
have
to
be
honest
with
you
there
are
too
many
republicans
in
congress
right
now
who
refuse
to
compromise
even
an
inch
when
it
comes
to
closing
tax
loopholes
and
special
interest
tax
breaks
and
that
what
holding
things
up
right
now
keep
in
mind
nobody
is
asking
them
to
raise
income
tax
rates
all
asking
is
to
consider
closing
tax
loopholes
and
deductions
that
the
speaker
of
the
house
john
said
he
was
willing
to
do
just
few
months
ago
he
said
there
were
bunch
of
loopholes
and
deductions
you
could
close
he
said
you
could
raise
billion
trillion
dollars
by
closing
loopholes
well
we
not
even
asking
for
that
much
all
we
asking
is
that
they
close
loopholes
for
the
and
the
for
hedge
fund
managers
or
oil
companies
or
corporate
jet
owners
who
are
all
doing
very
well
and
need
these
tax
loopholes
so
we
can
avoid
laying
off
workers
or
kicking
kids
off
head
start
or
reducing
financial
aid
for
college
students
think
too
much
to
ask
do
not
think
that
is
partisan
the
majority
of
the
american
people
agree
with
me
the
majority
of
news
agrees
with
me
we
need
to
get
this
done
but
the
choice
is
up
to
congress
only
congress
has
the
power
to
pass
law
that
stops
these
damaging
cuts
and
replaces
them
with
smart
savings
and
tax
reform
and
the
second
get
that
bill
on
my
desk
will
sign
it
into
law
but
got
to
get
congress
to
pass
it
none
of
us
will
get
percent
of
what
we
want
democrats
they
got
to
make
some
tough
choices
too
democrats
like
me
we
said
we
prepared
to
make
some
tough
cuts
and
reforms
including
to
programs
like
but
if
we
willing
to
compromise
then
republicans
in
the
house
have
to
compromise
as
well
what
democracy
is
about
what
this
country
needs
right
now
so
let
me
just
make
one
last
point
by
the
way
for
those
of
you
who
are
following
this
now
lately
some
people
have
been
saying
well
maybe
we
just
give
the
president
some
flexibility
he
could
make
the
cuts
the
way
he
wants
and
that
way
it
be
as
damaging
the
problem
is
when
you
cutting
billion
in
seven
months
which
represents
over
cut
in
the
budget
in
seven
months
there
no
smart
way
to
do
that
there
no
smart
way
to
do
that
you
do
want
to
have
to
choose
between
let
see
do
close
funding
for
the
disabled
kid
or
the
poor
kid
do
close
this
navy
shipyard
or
some
other
one
when
you
doing
things
in
way
that
not
smart
you
gloss
over
the
pain
and
the
impact
it
going
to
have
on
the
economy
and
the
broader
point
is
virginia
we
just
cut
our
way
to
prosperity
we
just
cut
our
way
to
prosperity
we
ask
seniors
and
working
families
like
yours
to
shoulder
the
entire
burden
of
deficit
reduction
while
asking
nothing
more
from
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
powerful
we
not
going
to
grow
the
middle
class
just
by
shifting
the
cost
of
health
care
or
college
onto
families
that
are
already
struggling
or
forcing
communities
to
lay
off
more
teachers
or
cops
or
firefighters
or
shipbuilders
and
then
folks
who
are
doing
really
well
have
to
do
anything
more
not
fair
and
it
not
good
for
the
economy
and
the
other
thing
we
got
to
do
is
to
stop
having
these
crises
manufactured
every
month
it
seems
like
know
you
guys
must
get
tired
of
it
we
just
solve
this
thing
now
we
got
another
thing
coming
up
mean
think
about
if
mike
ran
his
business
this
way
once
every
month
or
two
there
would
be
some
crisis
and
you
be
sure
whether
or
not
you
were
working
or
not
even
if
it
got
solved
eventually
or
ultimately
it
would
be
pretty
discouraging
on
people
you
would
be
less
productive
ships
get
built
as
fast
you
would
waste
money
because
you
know
exactly
what
to
expect
folks
are
sure
am
showing
up
to
work
today
or
not
if
it
not
good
way
to
run
business
it
sure
not
good
way
to
run
country
now
all
of
you
the
american
people
worked
too
hard
for
too
long
rebuilding
and
digging
our
way
out
of
the
financial
crisis
back
in
and
just
to
see
congress
cause
another
one
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
keep
on
conducting
its
business
drifting
from
one
crisis
to
the
next
we
got
to
have
plan
we
got
to
invest
in
our
common
future
our
true
north
is
growing
economy
that
creates
good
jobs
country
that
provides
its
people
with
the
skills
they
need
to
get
those
jobs
and
make
sure
that
you
getting
paid
decent
wage
for
working
hard
so
you
can
support
your
families
what
we
should
be
focused
on
right
now
not
weakening
the
economy
not
laying
people
off
what
we
should
be
talking
about
in
washington
and
if
you
agree
with
me
need
you
to
make
sure
your
voices
are
heard
let
your
leaders
know
what
you
expect
of
them
let
them
know
what
you
believe
let
them
know
that
what
this
country
was
built
on
was
sense
of
obligation
to
not
just
each
other
but
to
future
generations
that
we
got
to
shoulder
those
obligations
as
one
nation
and
as
one
people
was
in
conversation
with
some
of
the
governors
from
across
the
country
yesterday
and
told
them
said
run
my
last
election
is
very
happy
about
that
not
interested
in
spin
not
interested
in
playing
blame
game
at
this
point
all
interested
in
is
just
solving
problems
all
interested
in
is
making
sure
that
when
you
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
get
to
this
ship
at
in
the
morning
that
you
know
if
you
do
good
job
and
if
you
work
hard
and
if
you
making
sure
that
all
the
parts
to
this
incredible
ship
that
you
building
are
where
they
need
to
be
if
you
doing
what
you
do
then
you
can
go
home
feeling
satisfied
did
my
job
did
my
part
can
support
my
family
can
take
pride
in
what
done
for
this
country
all
want
want
us
to
be
able
to
look
back
five
years
from
now
years
from
now
and
say
we
took
care
of
our
business
and
we
put
an
end
to
some
of
these
games
that
maybe
guess
are
entertaining
for
some
but
are
hurting
too
many
people
but
in
order
for
us
to
make
that
happen
going
to
need
you
the
one
thing
about
being
president
is
after
four
years
you
get
pretty
humble
think
maybe
you
would
but
actually
you
become
more
humble
you
what
you
do
know
you
all
the
mistakes
made
but
you
also
you
do
things
by
yourself
that
not
how
our
system
works
got
to
have
the
help
and
the
goodwill
of
congress
and
what
that
means
is
got
to
make
sure
that
constituents
of
members
of
congress
are
putting
some
pressure
on
them
making
sure
doing
the
right
thing
putting
an
end
to
some
of
these
political
games
so
need
you
virginia
to
keep
up
the
pressure
need
you
to
keep
up
the
effort
need
you
to
keep
up
the
fight
if
you
do
congress
will
listen
if
you
stand
up
and
speak
out
congress
will
listen
and
together
we
will
unleash
our
true
potential
and
we
remind
the
world
just
why
it
is
the
united
states
builds
the
greatest
ships
on
earth

is
the
greatest
nation

then
work
towards
giving
every
child
every
chance
in
life
building
stronger
communities
and
new
ladders
of
opportunity
that
they
can
climb
into
the
middle
class
and
beyond
and
most
importantly
keeping
them
safe
from
harm
was
born
and
raised
here
proud
daughter
of
the
south
side
last
weekend
she
came
home
but
it
was
to
attend
the
funeral
of
and
parents
by
the
way
are
here
and
want
to
just
acknowledge
them
they
are
just
wonderful
wonderful
people
and
as
you
know
this
week
in
my
state
of
the
union
talked
about
on
tuesday
night
and
the
fact
that
unfortunately
what
happened
to
is
not
unique
it
not
unique
to
chicago
it
not
unique
to
this
country
too
many
of
our
children
are
being
taken
away
from
us
two
months
ago
america
mourned
innocent
and
their
educators
in
and
today
had
the
high
of
giving
the
highest
civilian
award
can
give
to
the
parent
or
the
families
of
the
educators
who
had
been
killed
in
and
there
was
something
profound
and
uniquely
heartbreaking
and
tragic
obviously
about
group
of
being
killed
but
last
year
there
were
murders
with
firearm
on
the
streets
of
this
city
and
of
those
victims
were
and
under
so
the
equivalent
of
every
four
months
and
precisely
why
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
are
asking
for
some
proposals
to
make
it
harder
for
criminals
to
get
their
hands
on
gun
and
as
said
on
tuesday
night
not
everybody
agrees
with
every
issue
there
are
regional
differences
the
experience
of
gun
ownership
is
different
in
urban
areas
than
it
is
in
rural
areas
different
from
and
illinois
but
these
proposals
deserve
vote
in
congress
they
deserve
vote
they
deserve
vote
and
want
to
thank
those
members
of
congress
who
are
working
together
in
serious
way
to
try
to
address
this
issue
but
also
said
no
law
or
set
of
laws
can
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
in
this
country
when
child
opens
fire
on
another
child
hole
in
that
heart
that
government
fill
only
community
and
parents
and
teachers
and
clergy
can
fill
that
hole
in
too
many
today
whether
here
in
chicago
or
the
farthest
reaches
of
rural
america
it
can
feel
like
for
lot
of
young
people
the
future
only
extends
to
the
next
street
corner
or
the
outskirts
of
town
that
no
matter
how
much
you
work
or
how
hard
you
try
your
destiny
was
determined
the
moment
you
were
born
there
are
entire
where
young
people
they
see
an
example
of
somebody
succeeding
and
for
lot
of
young
boys
and
young
men
in
particular
they
see
an
example
of
fathers
or
grandfathers
uncles
who
are
in
position
to
support
families
and
be
held
up
and
respected
and
so
that
means
that
this
is
not
just
gun
issue
also
an
issue
of
the
kinds
of
communities
that
building
and
for
that
we
all
share
responsibility
as
citizens
to
fix
it
we
all
share
responsibility
to
move
this
country
closer
to
our
founding
vision
that
no
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
here
in
america
you
can
decide
your
own
destiny
you
can
succeed
if
you
work
hard
and
your
responsibilities
now
that
means
got
to
grow
our
economy
and
create
more
good
jobs
it
means
got
to
equip
every
american
with
the
skills
and
the
training
to
fill
those
jobs
and
it
means
got
to
rebuild
ladders
of
opportunity
for
everybody
willing
to
climb
them
now
that
starts
at
home
no
more
important
ingredient
for
success
nothing
that
would
be
more
important
for
us
reducing
violence
than
strong
stable
families
which
means
we
should
do
more
to
promote
marriage
and
encourage
fatherhood
get
me
wrong
as
the
son
of
single
mom
who
gave
everything
she
had
to
raise
me
with
the
help
of
my
grandparents
turned
out
okay
but
no
no
but
think
so
got
single
moms
out
here
heroic
in
what
doing
and
we
are
so
proud
of
them
but
at
the
same
time
wish
had
had
father
who
was
around
and
involved
loving
supportive
parents
and
by
the
way
all
kinds
of
parents
that
includes
foster
parents
and
that
includes
grandparents
and
extended
families
it
includes
gay
or
straight
parents
those
parents
supporting
kids
the
single
most
important
thing
unconditional
love
for
your
child
that
makes
difference
if
child
grows
up
with
parents
who
have
work
and
have
some
education
and
can
be
role
models
and
can
teach
integrity
and
responsibility
and
discipline
and
delayed
gratification
all
those
things
give
child
the
kind
of
foundation
that
allows
them
to
say
my
future
can
make
it
what
want
and
got
to
make
sure
that
every
child
has
that
and
in
some
cases
we
may
have
to
fill
the
gap
and
the
void
if
children
have
that
so
we
should
encourage
marriage
by
removing
the
financial
disincentives
for
couples
who
love
one
another
but
may
find
it
financially
disadvantageous
if
they
get
married
we
should
reform
our
child
support
laws
to
get
more
men
working
and
engaged
with
their
children
and
my
administration
will
continue
to
work
with
the
faith
community
and
the
private
sector
this
year
on
campaign
to
encourage
strong
parenting
and
fatherhood
because
what
makes
you
man
is
not
the
ability
to
make
child
the
courage
to
raise
one
we
also
know
though
that
there
is
no
surer
path
to
success
in
the
middle
class
than
good
education
and
what
we
now
know
is
that
that
has
to
begin
in
the
earliest
years
study
after
study
shows
that
the
earlier
child
starts
learning
the
more
likely
they
are
to
succeed
the
more
likely
they
are
to
do
well
at
park
academy
the
more
likely
they
are
to
graduate
the
more
likely
they
are
to
get
good
job
the
more
likely
they
are
to
form
stable
families
and
then
be
able
to
raise
children
themselves
who
get
off
to
good
start
chicago
already
has
competition
thanks
to
what
the
mayor
is
doing
that
rewards
the
best
in
the
city
so
has
already
this
but
what
also
done
is
say
give
every
child
across
america
access
to
public
preschool
every
child
not
just
some
every
dollar
we
put
into
early
childhood
education
can
save
down
the
road
by
boosting
graduation
rates
reducing
teen
pregnancy
reducing
violent
crime
reducing
the
welfare
rolls
making
sure
that
folks
who
have
work
now
paying
taxes
all
this
stuff
pays
back
huge
dividends
if
we
make
the
investment
so
make
this
happen
make
sure
every
child
has
the
chance
they
deserve
as
kids
go
through
school
recruit
new
math
and
science
teachers
to
make
sure
that
got
the
skills
that
the
future
demands
help
more
young
people
in
get
summer
jobs
redesign
our
high
schools
and
encourage
our
kids
to
stay
in
high
school
so
that
the
diploma
they
get
leads
directly
to
good
job
once
they
graduate
right
here
in
chicago
five
new
high
schools
have
partnered
with
companies
and
community
colleges
to
prepare
our
kids
with
the
skills
that
businesses
are
looking
for
right
now
and
your
college
to
careers
program
helps
community
college
students
get
access
to
the
same
kinds
of
experiences
so
we
know
what
works
just
do
it
in
more
places
reach
more
young
people
give
more
kids
chance
so
we
know
how
important
families
are
we
know
how
important
education
is
we
that
government
alone
solve
these
problems
of
violence
and
poverty
that
everybody
has
to
be
involved
but
we
also
have
to
remember
that
the
broader
economic
environment
of
communities
is
critical
as
well
for
example
we
need
to
make
sure
that
folks
who
are
working
now
often
in
the
hardest
jobs
see
their
work
rewarded
with
wages
that
allow
them
to
raise
family
without
falling
into
poverty
today
family
with
two
kids
that
works
hard
and
relies
on
minimum
wage
salary
still
lives
below
the
poverty
line
wrong
and
we
should
fix
it
we
should
reward
an
honest
work
with
honest
wages
and
that
why
we
should
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
an
hour
and
make
it
wage
you
can
live
on
and
even
though
some
cities
have
bounced
back
pretty
quickly
from
the
recession
we
know
that
there
are
communities
and
within
cities
or
in
small
towns
that
bounced
back
cities
like
chicago
are
ringed
with
former
factory
towns
that
never
came
back
all
the
way
from
plants
packing
up
there
are
pockets
of
poverty
where
young
adults
are
still
looking
for
their
first
job
and
why
on
tuesday
announced
and
that
part
of
what
want
to
focus
on
here
in
chicago
and
across
the
country
is
my
intention
to
partner
with
of
the
communities
in
america
to
get
them
back
in
the
game
get
them
back
in
the
game
first
work
with
local
leaders
to
cut
through
red
tape
and
improve
things
like
public
safety
and
education
and
housing
and
bring
all
the
resources
to
bear
in
coordinated
fashion
so
that
we
can
get
that
tipping
point
where
suddenly
community
starts
feeling
like
things
are
changing
and
we
can
come
back
second
of
all
if
willing
to
play
role
in
education
then
help
you
reform
your
schools
we
want
to
seed
more
and
more
partnerships
of
the
kind
that
is
trying
to
set
up
third
going
to
help
bring
jobs
and
growth
to
by
giving
tax
breaks
to
business
owners
who
invest
and
hire
in
those
fourth
and
specific
to
the
issue
of
violence
because
very
hard
to
develop
economically
if
people
do
feel
safe
if
they
do
feel
like
they
can
walk
down
the
street
and
shop
at
store
without
getting
hit
over
head
or
worse
then
commerce
dries
up
businesses
do
want
to
locate
families
move
out
you
get
into
the
wrong
cycle
so
going
to
target
struggling
to
deal
with
violent
crime
and
help
them
reduce
that
violence
in
ways
that
have
been
proven
to
work
and
know
this
is
priority
of
your
going
to
be
priority
of
mine
and
finally
going
to
keep
working
in
communities
all
across
the
country
including
here
in
chicago
to
replace
public
housing
that
offer
much
hope
or
safety
with
new
healthy
homes
for
and
families
and
here
in
seen
some
of
the
progress
that
we
can
make
when
we
come
together
to
rebuild
our
and
attract
new
businesses
and
improve
our
schools
is
not
all
the
way
where
it
needs
to
be
but
thanks
to
wonderful
institutions
like
apostolic
church
made
great
progress
so
we
want
to
help
more
communities
follow
your
example
and
go
even
farther
by
offering
incentives
to
companies
that
hire
unemployed
americans
who
have
got
what
it
takes
to
fill
job
opening
but
they
may
have
been
out
of
work
so
long
that
nobody
is
willing
to
give
them
chance
right
now
put
our
people
back
to
work
rebuilding
vacant
homes
in
need
of
repair
young
people
can
get
experience
apprenticeships
learn
trade
and
removing
blight
from
our
community
if
we
gather
together
what
works
we
can
extend
more
ladders
of
opportunity
for
anybody
working
to
build
strong
life
for
themselves
because
in
america
your
destiny
be
determined
by
where
you
live
where
you
were
born
it
should
be
determined
by
how
big
willing
to
dream
how
much
effort
and
sweat
and
tears
willing
to
put
in
to
that
dream
when
first
moved
to
chicago
before
any
of
the
students
in
this
room
were
born
and
whole
lot
of
people
who
are
in
the
audience
remember
me
from
those
days
lived
in
community
on
the
south
side
right
up
the
block
but
also
worked
further
south
where
communities
had
been
devastated
by
some
of
the
steel
plants
closing
and
my
job
was
to
work
with
churches
and
and
local
leaders
to
rebuild
and
improve
schools
and
help
young
people
who
felt
like
they
had
nowhere
to
turn
and
those
of
you
who
worked
with
me
reverend
love
you
remember
it
easy
progress
come
quickly
sometimes
got
so
discouraged
thought
about
just
giving
up
but
what
kept
me
going
was
the
belief
that
with
enough
determination
and
effort
and
persistence
and
perseverance
change
is
always
possible
that
we
may
not
be
able
to
help
everybody
but
if
we
help
few
then
that
propels
progress
forward
we
may
not
be
able
to
save
every
child
from
gun
violence
but
if
we
save
few
that
starts
changing
the
atmosphere
in
our
communities
we
may
not
be
able
to
get
everybody
job
right
away
but
if
we
get
few
folks
job
then
everybody
starts
feeling
little
more
hopeful
and
little
more
encouraged
by
one
block
by
one
block
one
family
at
time
now
this
is
what
had
chance
to
talk
about
when
met
with
some
young
men
from
park
academy
who
were
participating
in
this
program
where
are
the
guys
talked
to
stand
up
you
all
so
we
can
all
see
you
guys
so
these
are
some
these
are
all
some
exceptional
young
men
and
could
be
prouder
of
them
and
the
reason
proud
of
them
is
because
lot
of
them
have
had
some
issues
that
part
of
the
reason
why
you
guys
are
in
the
program
but
what
explained
to
them
was
had
issues
too
when
was
their
age
just
had
an
environment
that
was
little
more
forgiving
so
when
screwed
up
the
consequences
were
as
high
as
when
kids
on
the
south
side
screw
up
so
had
more
of
safety
net
but
these
guys
are
no
different
than
me
and
we
had
that
conversation
about
what
does
it
take
to
change
and
the
same
thing
that
it
takes
for
us
individually
to
change
said
to
them
well
that
what
it
takes
for
communities
to
change
that
what
it
takes
for
countries
to
change
it
not
easy
but
it
does
require
us
first
of
all
having
vision
about
where
we
want
to
be
it
requires
us
that
it
will
be
hard
work
getting
there
it
requires
us
being
able
to
overcome
and
persevere
in
the
face
of
roadblocks
and
disappointments
and
failures
it
requires
us
reflecting
internally
about
who
we
are
and
what
we
believe
in
and
facing
up
to
our
own
fears
and
insecurities
and
admitting
when
we
wrong
and
that
same
thing
that
we
have
to
do
in
our
individual
lives
that
these
guys
talked
about
that
what
we
have
to
do
for
our
communities
and
it
will
not
be
easy
but
it
can
be
done
when
and
her
classmates
visited
washington
three
weeks
ago
they
spent
time
visiting
the
monuments
including
the
martin
luther
king
memorial
just
off
the
national
mall
and
that
memorial
stands
as
tribute
to
everything
king
achieved
in
his
lifetime
but
it
also
reminds
us
of
how
hard
that
work
was
and
how
many
disappointments
he
experienced
he
was
here
in
chicago
fighting
poverty
and
just
like
lot
of
us
there
were
times
where
he
felt
like
he
was
losing
hope
so
in
some
ways
that
memorial
is
testament
not
to
work
that
completed
but
testament
to
the
work
that
remains
unfinished
his
goal
was
to
free
us
not
only
from
the
shackles
of
discrimination
but
from
the
shadow
of
poverty
that
haunts
too
many
of
our
communities
the
impulses
and
the
mindless
violence
that
claims
so
many
lives
of
so
many
innocent
young
people
these
are
difficult
challenges
no
solution
we
offer
will
be
perfect
but
perfection
has
never
been
our
goal
our
goal
has
been
to
try
and
make
whatever
difference
we
can
our
goal
has
been
to
engage
in
the
hard
but
necessary
work
of
bringing
america
one
step
closer
to
the
nation
we
know
we
can
be
if
we
do
that
if
striving
with
every
of
our
being
to
strengthen
our
middle
class
to
extend
ladders
of
opportunity
for
everybody
who
is
trying
as
hard
as
they
can
to
create
better
life
for
themselves
if
we
do
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
our
children
safe
from
harm
if
fulfilling
our
obligations
to
one
another
and
to
future
generations
if
we
make
that
effort
then
confident
confident
that
we
will
write
the
next
great
chapter
in
our
american
story
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
by
myself
though
nobody
can
going
to
have
to
do
it
together
thank
you
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
speaker
vice
president
members
of
congress
fellow
citizens
years
ago
john
kennedy
declared
to
this
chamber
that
constitution
makes
us
not
rivals
for
power
but
partners
for
is
my
task
he
said
report
the
state
of
the
union
to
improve
it
is
the
task
of
us
tonight
thanks
to
the
grit
and
determination
of
the
american
people
there
is
much
progress
to
report
after
decade
of
grinding
war
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
coming
home
after
years
of
grueling
recession
our
businesses
have
created
over
six
million
new
jobs
we
buy
more
american
cars
than
we
have
in
five
years
and
less
foreign
oil
than
we
have
in
our
housing
market
is
healing
our
stock
market
is
rebounding
and
consumers
patients
and
homeowners
enjoy
stronger
protections
than
ever
before
so
together
we
have
cleared
away
the
rubble
of
crisis
and
we
can
say
with
renewed
confidence
that
the
state
of
our
union
is
stronger
but
we
gather
here
knowing
that
there
are
millions
of
americans
whose
hard
work
and
dedication
have
not
yet
been
rewarded
our
economy
is
adding
jobs
but
too
many
people
still
find
employment
corporate
profits
have
to
highs
but
for
more
than
decade
wages
and
incomes
have
barely
budged
it
is
our
task
then
to
the
true
engine
of
economic
growth
rising
thriving
middle
class
it
is
our
unfinished
task
to
restore
the
basic
bargain
that
built
this
country
the
idea
that
if
you
work
hard
and
meet
your
responsibilities
you
can
get
ahead
no
matter
where
you
come
from
no
matter
what
you
look
like
or
who
you
love
it
is
our
unfinished
task
to
make
sure
that
this
government
works
on
behalf
of
the
many
and
not
just
the
few
that
it
encourages
free
enterprise
rewards
individual
initiative
and
opens
the
doors
of
opportunity
to
every
child
across
this
great
nation
the
american
people
expect
government
to
solve
every
problem
they
expect
those
of
us
in
this
chamber
to
agree
on
every
issue
but
they
do
expect
us
to
put
the
interests
before
party
they
do
expect
us
to
forge
reasonable
compromise
where
we
can
for
they
know
that
america
moves
forward
only
when
we
do
so
together
and
that
the
responsibility
of
improving
this
union
remains
the
task
of
us
all
our
work
must
begin
by
making
some
basic
decisions
about
our
budget
decisions
that
will
have
huge
impact
on
the
strength
of
our
recovery
over
the
last
few
years
both
parties
have
worked
together
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
trillion
mostly
through
spending
cuts
but
also
by
raising
tax
rates
on
the
wealthiest
percent
of
americans
as
result
we
are
more
than
halfway
towards
the
goal
of
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
that
economists
say
we
need
to
our
finances
now
we
need
to
finish
the
job
and
the
question
is
how
in
congress
passed
law
saying
that
if
both
parties
agree
on
plan
to
reach
our
deficit
goal
about
trillion
worth
of
budget
cuts
would
automatically
go
into
effect
this
year
these
sudden
harsh
arbitrary
cuts
would
our
military
readiness
devastate
priorities
like
education
and
energy
and
medical
research
they
would
certainly
slow
our
recovery
and
cost
us
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
why
democrats
republicans
business
leaders
and
economists
have
already
said
that
these
cuts
known
here
in
washington
as
the
are
really
bad
idea
now
some
in
congress
have
proposed
preventing
only
the
cuts
by
making
even
bigger
cuts
to
things
like
education
and
job
training
and
social
security
benefits
that
idea
is
even
worse
yes
the
biggest
driver
of
our
debt
is
the
rising
cost
of
health
care
for
an
aging
population
and
those
of
us
who
care
deeply
about
programs
like
must
embrace
the
need
for
modest
reforms
otherwise
our
retirement
programs
will
crowd
out
the
investments
we
need
for
our
children
and
the
promise
of
secure
retirement
for
future
generations
but
we
ask
senior
citizens
and
working
families
to
shoulder
the
entire
burden
of
deficit
reduction
while
asking
nothing
more
from
the
wealthiest
and
the
most
powerful
we
grow
the
middle
class
simply
by
shifting
the
cost
of
health
care
or
college
onto
families
that
are
already
struggling
or
by
forcing
communities
to
lay
off
more
teachers
and
more
cops
and
more
firefighters
most
americans
democrats
republicans
and
independents
understand
that
we
just
cut
our
way
to
prosperity
they
know
that
economic
growth
requires
balanced
approach
to
deficit
reduction
with
spending
cuts
and
revenue
and
with
everybody
doing
their
fair
share
and
the
approach
offer
tonight
on
prepared
to
enact
reforms
that
will
achieve
the
same
amount
of
health
care
savings
by
the
beginning
of
the
next
decade
as
the
reforms
proposed
by
the
bipartisan
commission
already
the
affordable
care
act
is
helping
to
slow
the
growth
of
health
care
costs
and
the
reforms
proposing
go
even
further
reduce
taxpayer
subsidies
to
prescription
drug
companies
and
ask
more
from
the
wealthiest
seniors
bring
down
costs
by
changing
the
way
our
government
pays
for
because
our
medical
bills
be
based
on
the
number
of
tests
ordered
or
days
spent
in
the
hospital
they
should
be
based
on
the
quality
of
care
that
our
seniors
receive
and
am
open
to
additional
reforms
from
both
parties
so
long
as
they
violate
the
guarantee
of
secure
retirement
our
government
make
promises
we
can
not
keep
but
we
must
keep
the
promises
already
made
to
hit
the
rest
of
our
deficit
reduction
target
we
should
do
what
leaders
in
both
parties
have
already
suggested
and
save
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
getting
rid
of
tax
loopholes
and
deductions
for
the
and
the
after
all
why
would
we
choose
to
make
deeper
cuts
to
education
and
just
to
protect
special
interest
tax
breaks
how
is
that
fair
why
is
it
that
deficit
reduction
is
big
emergency
justifying
making
cuts
in
social
security
benefits
but
not
closing
some
loopholes
how
does
that
promote
growth
now
is
our
best
chance
for
bipartisan
comprehensive
tax
reform
that
encourages
job
creation
and
helps
bring
down
the
deficit
we
can
get
this
done
the
american
people
deserve
tax
code
that
helps
small
businesses
spend
less
time
filling
out
complicated
forms
and
more
time
expanding
and
hiring
tax
code
that
ensures
billionaires
with
accountants
work
the
system
and
pay
lower
rate
than
their
hardworking
secretaries
tax
code
that
lowers
incentives
to
move
jobs
overseas
and
lowers
tax
rates
for
businesses
and
manufacturers
that
are
creating
jobs
right
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
what
tax
reform
can
deliver
what
we
can
do
together
that
tax
reform
and
entitlement
reform
will
not
be
easy
the
politics
will
be
hard
for
both
sides
none
of
us
will
get
percent
of
what
we
want
but
the
alternative
will
cost
us
jobs
hurt
our
economy
visit
hardship
on
millions
of
hardworking
americans
so
set
party
interests
aside
and
work
to
pass
budget
that
replaces
reckless
cuts
with
smart
savings
and
wise
investments
in
our
future
and
do
it
without
the
that
stresses
consumers
and
scares
off
investors
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
can
not
keep
conducting
its
business
by
drifting
from
one
manufactured
crisis
to
the
next
we
do
it
agree
right
here
right
now
to
keep
the
government
open
and
pay
our
bills
on
time
and
always
uphold
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
american
people
have
worked
too
hard
for
too
long
rebuilding
from
one
crisis
to
see
their
elected
officials
cause
another
now
most
of
us
agree
that
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
must
be
part
of
our
agenda
but
be
clear
deficit
reduction
alone
is
not
an
economic
plan
growing
economy
that
creates
good
jobs
that
must
be
the
north
star
that
guides
our
efforts
every
day
we
should
ask
ourselves
three
questions
as
nation
how
do
we
attract
more
jobs
to
our
shores
how
do
we
equip
our
people
with
the
skills
they
need
to
get
those
jobs
and
how
do
we
make
sure
that
hard
work
leads
to
decent
living
year
and
half
ago
put
forward
an
american
jobs
act
that
independent
economists
said
would
create
more
than
million
new
jobs
and
thank
the
last
congress
for
passing
some
of
that
agenda
urge
this
congress
to
pass
the
rest
but
tonight
lay
out
additional
proposals
that
are
fully
paid
for
and
fully
consistent
with
the
budget
framework
both
parties
agreed
to
just
months
ago
let
me
repeat
nothing
proposing
tonight
should
increase
our
deficit
by
single
dime
it
is
not
bigger
government
we
need
but
smarter
government
that
sets
priorities
and
invests
in
growth
that
what
we
should
be
looking
for
our
first
priority
is
making
america
magnet
for
new
jobs
and
manufacturing
after
shedding
jobs
for
more
than
years
our
manufacturers
have
added
about
jobs
over
the
past
three
caterpillar
is
bringing
jobs
back
from
japan
ford
is
bringing
jobs
back
from
mexico
and
this
year
apple
will
start
making
in
america
again
there
are
things
we
can
do
right
now
to
accelerate
this
trend
last
year
we
created
our
first
manufacturing
innovation
institute
in
ohio
warehouse
is
now
art
lab
where
new
workers
are
mastering
the
printing
that
has
the
potential
to
the
way
we
make
almost
everything
no
reason
this
happen
in
other
towns
so
tonight
announcing
the
launch
of
three
more
of
these
manufacturing
hubs
where
businesses
will
partner
with
the
department
of
and
energy
to
turn
regions
left
behind
by
into
global
of
jobs
and
ask
this
congress
to
help
create
network
of
of
these
hubs
and
guarantee
that
the
next
revolution
in
manufacturing
is
made
right
here
in
america
we
can
get
that
done
now
if
we
want
to
make
the
best
products
we
also
have
to
invest
in
the
best
ideas
every
dollar
we
invested
to
map
the
human
genome
returned
to
our
economy
every
dollar
today
our
scientists
are
mapping
the
human
brain
to
unlock
the
answers
to
developing
drugs
to
regenerate
damaged
organs
devising
new
material
to
make
batteries
times
more
powerful
now
is
not
the
time
to
gut
these
investments
in
science
and
innovation
now
is
the
time
to
reach
level
of
research
and
development
not
seen
since
the
height
of
the
space
race
we
need
to
make
those
investments
today
no
area
holds
more
promise
than
our
investments
in
american
energy
after
years
of
talking
about
it
finally
poised
to
control
our
own
energy
future
we
produce
more
oil
at
home
than
we
have
in
years
we
have
doubled
the
distance
our
cars
will
go
on
gallon
of
gas
and
the
amount
of
renewable
energy
we
generate
from
sources
like
wind
and
solar
with
tens
of
thousands
of
good
american
jobs
to
show
for
it
we
produce
more
natural
gas
than
ever
before
and
nearly
energy
bill
is
lower
because
of
it
and
over
the
last
four
years
our
emissions
of
the
dangerous
carbon
pollution
that
threatens
our
planet
have
actually
fallen
but
for
the
sake
of
our
children
and
our
future
we
must
do
more
to
combat
climate
change
now
true
that
no
single
event
makes
trend
but
the
fact
is
the
hottest
years
on
record
have
all
come
in
the
last
heat
waves
droughts
wildfires
floods
all
are
now
more
frequent
and
more
intense
we
can
choose
to
believe
that
sandy
and
the
most
severe
drought
in
decades
and
the
worst
wildfires
some
states
have
ever
seen
were
all
just
freak
coincidence
or
we
can
choose
to
believe
in
the
overwhelming
judgment
of
science
and
act
before
too
late
now
the
good
news
is
we
can
make
meaningful
progress
on
this
issue
while
driving
strong
economic
growth
urge
this
congress
to
get
together
pursue
bipartisan
solution
to
climate
change
like
the
one
john
and
worked
on
together
few
years
ago
but
if
congress
act
soon
to
protect
future
generations
will
will
direct
my
cabinet
to
come
up
with
executive
actions
we
can
take
now
and
in
the
future
to
reduce
pollution
prepare
our
communities
for
the
consequences
of
climate
change
and
speed
the
transition
to
more
sustainable
sources
of
energy
four
years
ago
other
countries
dominated
the
clean
energy
market
and
the
jobs
that
came
with
it
and
begun
to
change
that
last
year
wind
energy
added
nearly
half
of
all
new
power
capacity
in
america
so
generate
even
more
solar
energy
gets
cheaper
by
the
year
drive
down
costs
even
further
as
long
as
countries
like
china
keep
going
all
in
on
clean
energy
so
must
we
now
in
the
meantime
the
natural
gas
boom
has
led
to
cleaner
power
and
greater
energy
independence
we
need
to
encourage
that
and
why
my
administration
will
keep
cutting
red
tape
and
speeding
up
new
oil
and
gas
permits
got
to
be
part
of
an
plan
but
also
want
to
work
with
this
congress
to
encourage
the
research
and
technology
that
helps
natural
gas
burn
even
cleaner
and
protects
our
air
and
our
water
in
fact
much
of
our
energy
is
drawn
from
lands
and
waters
that
we
the
public
own
together
so
tonight
propose
we
use
some
of
our
oil
and
gas
revenues
to
fund
an
energy
security
trust
that
will
drive
new
research
and
technology
to
shift
our
cars
and
trucks
off
oil
for
good
if
coalition
of
and
retired
generals
and
admirals
can
get
behind
this
idea
then
so
can
we
take
their
advice
and
free
our
families
and
businesses
from
the
painful
spikes
in
gas
prices
put
up
with
for
far
too
long
also
issuing
new
goal
for
america
cut
in
half
the
energy
wasted
by
our
homes
and
businesses
over
the
next
years
we
work
with
the
states
to
do
it
those
states
with
the
best
ideas
to
create
jobs
and
lower
energy
bills
by
constructing
more
efficient
buildings
will
receive
federal
support
to
help
make
that
happen
energy
sector
is
just
one
part
of
an
aging
infrastructure
badly
in
need
of
repair
ask
any
where
rather
locate
and
hire
country
with
deteriorating
roads
and
bridges
or
one
with
rail
and
internet
schools
power
grids
the
of
america
company
that
brought
hundreds
of
new
jobs
to
north
said
that
if
we
upgrade
our
infrastructure
bring
even
more
jobs
and
the
attitude
of
lot
of
companies
all
around
the
world
and
know
you
want
these
projects
in
your
district
seen
all
those
so
tonight
propose
program
to
put
people
to
work
as
soon
as
possible
on
our
most
urgent
repairs
like
the
nearly
structurally
deficient
bridges
across
the
country
and
to
make
sure
taxpayers
shoulder
the
whole
burden
also
proposing
partnership
to
rebuild
america
that
attracts
private
capital
to
upgrade
what
our
businesses
need
most
modern
ports
to
move
our
goods
modern
pipelines
to
withstand
storm
modern
schools
worthy
of
our
children
prove
that
no
better
place
to
do
business
than
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
start
right
away
we
can
get
this
done
and
part
of
our
rebuilding
effort
must
also
involve
our
housing
sector
the
good
news
is
our
housing
market
is
finally
healing
from
the
collapse
of
home
prices
are
rising
at
the
fastest
pace
in
six
years
home
purchases
are
up
nearly
percent
and
construction
is
expanding
again
but
even
with
mortgage
rates
near
low
too
many
families
with
solid
credit
who
want
to
buy
home
are
being
rejected
too
many
families
who
never
missed
payment
and
want
to
refinance
are
being
told
no
holding
our
entire
economy
back
we
need
to
fix
it
right
now
bill
in
this
congress
that
would
give
every
responsible
homeowner
in
america
the
chance
to
save
year
by
refinancing
at
rates
democrats
and
republicans
have
supported
it
before
so
what
are
we
waiting
for
take
vote
and
send
me
that
bill
why
would
we
be
against
that
why
would
that
be
partisan
issue
helping
folks
refinance
right
now
overlapping
regulations
keep
responsible
young
families
from
buying
their
first
home
holding
us
back
streamline
the
process
and
help
our
economy
grow
these
initiatives
in
manufacturing
energy
infrastructure
housing
all
these
things
will
help
entrepreneurs
and
small
business
owners
expand
and
create
new
jobs
but
none
of
it
will
matter
unless
we
also
equip
our
citizens
with
the
skills
and
training
to
fill
those
jobs
and
that
has
to
start
at
the
earliest
possible
age
study
after
study
shows
that
the
sooner
child
begins
learning
the
better
he
or
she
does
down
the
road
but
today
fewer
than
in
four
are
enrolled
in
preschool
program
most
parents
afford
few
hundred
bucks
week
for
private
preschool
and
for
poor
kids
who
need
help
the
most
this
lack
of
access
to
preschool
education
can
shadow
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
so
tonight
propose
working
with
states
to
make
preschool
available
to
every
single
child
in
america
that
something
we
should
be
able
to
do
every
dollar
we
invest
in
early
childhood
education
can
save
more
than
seven
dollars
later
on
by
boosting
graduation
rates
reducing
teen
pregnancy
even
reducing
violent
crime
in
states
that
make
it
priority
to
educate
our
youngest
children
like
georgia
or
oklahoma
studies
show
students
grow
up
more
likely
to
read
and
do
math
at
grade
level
graduate
high
school
hold
job
form
more
stable
families
of
their
own
we
know
this
works
so
do
what
works
and
make
sure
none
of
our
children
start
the
race
of
life
already
behind
give
our
kids
that
chance
also
make
sure
that
high
school
diploma
puts
our
kids
on
path
to
good
job
right
now
countries
like
germany
focus
on
graduating
their
high
school
students
with
the
equivalent
of
technical
degree
from
one
of
our
community
colleges
so
those
german
kids
they
ready
for
job
when
they
graduate
high
school
they
been
trained
for
the
jobs
that
are
there
now
at
schools
like
in
brooklyn
collaboration
between
new
york
public
schools
and
city
university
of
new
york
and
students
will
graduate
with
high
school
diploma
and
an
associate
degree
in
computers
or
engineering
we
need
to
give
every
american
student
opportunities
like
this
and
four
years
ago
we
started
race
to
the
top
competition
that
convinced
almost
every
state
to
develop
smarter
curricula
and
higher
standards
all
for
about
percent
of
what
we
spend
on
education
each
year
tonight
announcing
new
challenge
to
redesign
high
schools
so
they
better
equip
graduates
for
the
demands
of
economy
and
reward
schools
that
develop
new
partnerships
with
colleges
and
employers
and
create
classes
that
focus
on
science
technology
engineering
and
math
the
skills
employers
are
looking
for
to
fill
the
jobs
that
are
there
right
now
and
will
be
there
in
the
future
now
even
with
better
high
schools
most
young
people
will
need
some
higher
education
simple
fact
the
more
education
got
the
more
likely
you
are
to
have
good
job
and
work
your
way
into
the
middle
class
but
today
costs
price
too
many
young
people
out
of
higher
education
or
saddle
them
with
unsustainable
debt
through
tax
credits
grants
and
better
loans
made
college
more
affordable
for
millions
of
students
and
families
over
the
last
few
years
but
taxpayers
keep
on
higher
and
higher
and
higher
costs
for
higher
education
colleges
must
do
their
part
to
keep
costs
down
and
our
job
to
make
sure
that
they
do
so
tonight
ask
congress
to
change
the
higher
education
act
so
that
affordability
and
value
are
included
in
determining
which
colleges
receive
certain
types
of
federal
aid
and
tomorrow
my
administration
will
release
new
that
parents
and
students
can
use
to
compare
schools
based
on
simple
criteria
where
you
can
get
the
most
bang
for
your
educational
buck
now
to
grow
our
middle
class
our
citizens
have
to
have
access
to
the
education
and
training
that
jobs
require
but
we
also
have
to
make
sure
that
america
remains
place
where
everyone
willing
to
work
everybody
willing
to
work
hard
has
the
chance
to
get
ahead
our
economy
is
stronger
when
we
harness
the
talents
and
ingenuity
of
striving
hopeful
immigrants
and
right
now
leaders
from
the
business
law
enforcement
faith
communities
they
all
agree
that
the
time
has
come
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
now
is
the
time
to
do
it
now
is
the
time
to
get
it
done
now
is
the
time
to
get
it
done
real
reform
means
strong
border
security
and
we
can
build
on
the
progress
my
administration
has
already
made
putting
more
boots
on
the
southern
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
and
reducing
illegal
crossings
to
their
lowest
levels
in
years
real
reform
means
establishing
responsible
pathway
to
earned
citizenship
path
that
includes
passing
background
check
paying
taxes
and
meaningful
penalty
learning
english
and
going
to
the
back
of
the
line
behind
the
folks
trying
to
come
here
legally
and
real
reform
means
fixing
the
legal
immigration
system
to
cut
waiting
periods
and
attract
the
entrepreneurs
and
engineers
that
will
help
create
jobs
and
grow
our
economy
in
other
words
we
know
what
needs
to
be
done
and
as
we
speak
bipartisan
groups
in
both
chambers
are
working
diligently
to
draft
bill
and
applaud
their
efforts
so
get
this
done
send
me
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
in
the
next
few
months
and
will
sign
it
right
away
and
america
will
be
better
for
it
get
it
done
get
it
done
but
we
stop
there
we
know
our
economy
is
stronger
when
our
wives
our
mothers
our
daughters
can
live
their
lives
free
from
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
free
from
the
fear
of
domestic
violence
today
the
senate
passed
the
violence
against
women
act
that
originally
wrote
almost
years
ago
and
now
urge
the
house
to
do
the
same
good
job
and
ask
this
congress
to
declare
that
women
should
earn
living
equal
to
their
efforts
and
finally
pass
the
fairness
act
this
year
we
know
our
economy
is
stronger
when
we
reward
an
honest
work
with
honest
wages
but
today
worker
making
the
minimum
wage
earns
year
even
with
the
tax
relief
we
put
in
place
family
with
two
kids
that
earns
the
minimum
wage
still
lives
below
the
poverty
line
wrong
why
since
the
last
time
this
congress
raised
the
minimum
wage
states
have
chosen
to
bump
theirs
even
higher
tonight
declare
that
in
the
wealthiest
nation
on
earth
no
one
who
works
should
have
to
live
in
poverty
and
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
an
hour
we
should
be
able
to
get
that
done
this
single
step
would
raise
the
incomes
of
millions
of
working
families
it
could
mean
the
difference
between
groceries
or
the
food
bank
rent
or
eviction
scraping
by
or
finally
getting
ahead
for
businesses
across
the
country
it
would
mean
customers
with
more
money
in
their
pockets
and
whole
lot
of
folks
out
there
would
probably
need
less
help
from
government
in
fact
working
folks
have
to
wait
year
after
year
for
the
minimum
wage
to
go
up
while
pay
has
never
been
higher
so
an
idea
that
governor
and
actually
agreed
on
last
year
tie
the
minimum
wage
to
the
cost
of
living
so
that
it
finally
becomes
wage
you
can
live
on
tonight
also
that
there
are
communities
in
this
country
where
no
matter
how
hard
you
work
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
get
ahead
factory
towns
decimated
from
years
of
plants
packing
up
inescapable
pockets
of
poverty
urban
and
rural
where
young
adults
are
still
fighting
for
their
first
job
america
is
not
place
where
the
chance
of
birth
or
circumstance
should
decide
our
destiny
and
why
we
need
to
build
new
ladders
of
opportunity
into
the
middle
class
for
all
who
are
willing
to
climb
them
offer
incentives
to
companies
that
hire
americans
got
what
it
takes
to
fill
that
job
opening
but
have
been
out
of
work
so
long
that
no
one
will
give
them
chance
anymore
put
people
back
to
work
rebuilding
vacant
homes
in
and
this
year
my
administration
will
begin
to
partner
with
of
the
towns
in
america
to
get
these
communities
back
on
their
feet
work
with
local
leaders
to
target
resources
at
public
safety
and
education
and
housing
give
new
tax
credits
to
businesses
that
hire
and
invest
and
work
to
strengthen
families
by
removing
the
financial
deterrents
to
marriage
for
couples
and
do
more
to
encourage
fatherhood
because
what
makes
you
man
the
ability
to
conceive
child
having
the
courage
to
raise
one
and
we
want
to
encourage
that
we
want
to
help
that
stronger
families
stronger
communities
stronger
america
it
is
this
kind
of
prosperity
broad
shared
built
on
thriving
middle
class
that
has
always
been
the
source
of
our
progress
at
home
also
the
foundation
of
our
power
and
influence
throughout
the
world
tonight
we
stand
united
in
saluting
the
troops
and
civilians
who
sacrifice
every
day
to
protect
us
because
of
them
we
can
say
with
confidence
that
america
will
complete
its
mission
in
and
achieve
our
objective
of
defeating
the
core
of
already
we
have
brought
home
of
our
brave
servicemen
and
women
this
spring
our
forces
will
move
into
support
role
while
afghan
security
forces
take
the
lead
tonight
can
announce
that
over
the
next
year
another
american
troops
will
come
home
from
this
will
continue
and
by
the
end
of
next
year
our
war
in
will
be
over
beyond
commitment
to
unified
and
sovereign
will
endure
but
the
nature
of
our
commitment
will
change
we
negotiating
an
agreement
with
the
afghan
government
that
focuses
on
two
missions
training
and
equipping
afghan
forces
so
that
the
country
does
not
again
slip
into
chaos
and
efforts
that
allow
us
to
pursue
the
remnants
of
and
their
affiliates
today
the
that
attacked
us
on
is
shadow
of
its
former
self
it
true
different
affiliates
and
extremist
groups
have
emerged
from
the
arabian
peninsula
to
africa
the
threat
these
groups
pose
is
evolving
but
to
meet
this
threat
we
need
to
send
tens
of
thousands
of
our
sons
and
daughters
abroad
or
occupy
other
nations
instead
we
need
to
help
countries
like
yemen
and
libya
and
somalia
provide
for
their
own
security
and
help
allies
who
take
the
fight
to
terrorists
as
we
have
in
and
where
necessary
through
range
of
capabilities
we
will
continue
to
take
direct
action
against
those
terrorists
who
pose
the
gravest
threat
to
americans
now
as
we
do
we
must
enlist
our
values
in
the
fight
that
why
my
administration
has
worked
tirelessly
to
forge
durable
legal
and
policy
framework
to
guide
our
efforts
throughout
we
have
kept
congress
fully
informed
of
our
efforts
that
in
our
democracy
no
one
should
just
take
my
word
for
it
that
doing
things
the
right
way
so
in
the
months
ahead
will
continue
to
engage
congress
to
ensure
not
only
that
our
targeting
detention
and
prosecution
of
terrorists
remains
consistent
with
our
laws
and
system
of
checks
and
balances
but
that
our
efforts
are
even
more
transparent
to
the
american
people
and
to
the
world
of
course
our
challenges
end
with
america
will
continue
to
lead
the
effort
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
most
dangerous
weapons
the
regime
in
north
korea
must
know
they
will
only
achieve
security
and
prosperity
by
meeting
their
international
obligations
provocations
of
the
sort
we
saw
last
night
will
only
further
isolate
them
as
we
stand
by
our
allies
strengthen
our
own
missile
and
lead
the
world
in
taking
firm
action
in
response
to
these
threats
likewise
the
leaders
of
iran
must
that
now
is
the
time
for
diplomatic
solution
because
coalition
stands
united
in
demanding
that
they
meet
their
obligations
and
we
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
prevent
them
from
getting
nuclear
weapon
at
the
same
time
engage
russia
to
seek
further
reductions
in
our
nuclear
arsenals
and
continue
leading
the
global
effort
to
secure
nuclear
materials
that
could
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
because
our
ability
to
influence
others
depends
on
our
willingness
to
lead
and
meet
our
obligations
america
must
also
face
the
rapidly
growing
threat
from
now
we
know
hackers
steal
identities
and
infiltrate
private
we
know
foreign
countries
and
companies
swipe
our
corporate
secrets
now
our
enemies
are
also
seeking
the
ability
to
sabotage
our
power
grid
our
financial
institutions
our
air
traffic
control
systems
we
can
not
look
back
years
from
now
and
wonder
why
we
did
nothing
in
the
face
of
real
threats
to
our
security
and
our
economy
and
why
earlier
today
signed
new
executive
order
that
will
strengthen
our
defenses
by
increasing
information
sharing
and
developing
standards
to
protect
our
national
security
our
jobs
and
our
privacy
but
now
congress
must
act
as
well
by
passing
legislation
to
give
our
government
greater
capacity
to
secure
our
networks
and
deter
attacks
this
is
something
we
should
be
able
to
get
done
on
bipartisan
basis
now
even
as
we
protect
our
people
we
should
remember
that
world
presents
not
just
dangers
not
just
threats
it
presents
opportunities
to
boost
american
exports
support
american
jobs
and
level
the
playing
field
in
the
growing
markets
of
asia
we
intend
to
complete
negotiations
on
partnership
and
tonight
announcing
that
we
will
launch
talks
on
comprehensive
transatlantic
trade
and
investment
partnership
with
the
european
union
because
trade
that
is
fair
and
free
across
the
atlantic
supports
millions
of
american
jobs
we
also
know
that
progress
in
the
most
impoverished
parts
of
our
world
enriches
us
all
not
only
because
it
creates
new
markets
more
stable
order
in
certain
regions
of
the
world
but
also
because
the
right
thing
to
do
in
many
places
people
live
on
little
more
than
dollar
day
so
the
united
states
will
join
with
our
allies
to
eradicate
such
extreme
poverty
in
the
next
two
decades
by
connecting
more
people
to
the
global
economy
by
empowering
women
by
giving
our
young
and
brightest
minds
new
opportunities
to
serve
and
helping
communities
to
feed
and
power
and
educate
themselves
by
saving
the
children
from
preventable
deaths
and
by
the
promise
of
an
generation
which
is
within
our
reach
you
see
america
must
remain
beacon
to
all
who
seek
freedom
during
this
period
of
historic
change
saw
the
power
of
hope
last
year
in
in
burma
when
san
welcomed
an
american
president
into
the
home
where
she
had
been
imprisoned
for
years
when
thousands
of
burmese
lined
the
streets
waving
american
flags
including
man
who
said
is
justice
and
law
in
the
united
states
want
our
country
to
be
like
in
of
freedom
remain
the
anchor
of
strong
alliances
from
the
to
africa
from
europe
to
asia
in
the
middle
east
we
will
stand
with
citizens
as
they
demand
their
universal
rights
and
support
stable
transitions
to
democracy
we
know
the
process
will
be
messy
and
we
can
not
presume
to
dictate
the
course
of
change
in
countries
like
egypt
but
we
can
and
will
insist
on
respect
for
the
fundamental
rights
of
all
people
keep
the
pressure
on
syrian
regime
that
has
murdered
its
own
people
and
support
opposition
leaders
that
respect
the
rights
of
every
syrian
and
we
will
stand
steadfast
with
israel
in
pursuit
of
security
and
lasting
peace
these
are
the
messages
deliver
when
travel
to
the
middle
east
next
month
and
all
this
work
depends
on
the
courage
and
sacrifice
of
those
who
serve
in
dangerous
places
at
great
personal
risk
our
diplomats
our
intelligence
officers
and
the
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
as
long
as
we
will
do
whatever
we
must
to
protect
those
who
serve
their
country
abroad
and
we
will
maintain
the
best
military
the
world
has
ever
known
we
invest
in
new
capabilities
even
as
we
reduce
waste
and
wartime
spending
we
will
ensure
equal
treatment
for
all
and
equal
benefits
for
their
families
gay
and
straight
we
will
draw
upon
the
courage
and
skills
of
our
sisters
and
daughters
and
moms
because
women
have
proven
under
fire
that
they
are
ready
for
combat
we
will
keep
faith
with
our
veterans
investing
in
care
including
mental
health
care
for
our
wounded
warriors
supporting
our
military
families
giving
our
veterans
the
benefits
and
education
and
job
opportunities
that
they
have
earned
and
want
to
thank
my
wife
and
for
their
continued
dedication
to
serving
our
military
families
as
well
as
they
have
served
us
thank
you
honey
thank
you
defending
our
freedom
though
is
not
just
the
job
of
our
military
alone
we
must
all
do
our
part
to
make
sure
our
rights
are
protected
here
at
home
that
includes
one
of
the
most
fundamental
right
of
democracy
the
right
to
vote
when
any
american
no
matter
where
they
live
or
what
their
party
are
denied
that
right
because
they
afford
to
wait
for
five
or
six
or
seven
hours
just
to
cast
their
ballot
we
are
betraying
our
ideals
so
tonight
announcing
commission
to
improve
the
voting
experience
in
america
and
it
definitely
needs
improvement
asking
two
experts
in
the
field
who
by
the
way
recently
served
as
the
top
attorneys
for
my
campaign
and
for
governor
campaign
to
lead
it
we
can
fix
this
and
we
will
the
american
people
demand
it
and
so
does
our
democracy
of
course
what
said
tonight
matters
little
if
we
come
together
to
protect
our
most
precious
resource
our
children
it
has
been
two
months
since
know
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
country
has
debated
how
to
reduce
gun
violence
but
this
time
is
different
overwhelming
majorities
of
americans
americans
who
believe
in
the
second
amendment
have
come
together
around
reform
like
background
checks
that
will
make
it
harder
for
criminals
to
get
their
hands
on
gun
senators
of
both
parties
are
working
together
on
tough
new
laws
to
prevent
anyone
from
buying
guns
for
resale
to
criminals
police
chiefs
are
asking
our
help
to
get
weapons
of
war
and
massive
ammunition
magazines
off
our
streets
because
these
police
chiefs
tired
of
seeing
their
guys
and
gals
being
each
of
these
proposals
deserves
vote
in
congress
now
if
you
want
to
vote
no
your
choice
but
these
proposals
deserve
vote
because
in
the
two
months
since
more
than
thousand
birthdays
graduations
anniversaries
have
been
stolen
from
our
lives
by
bullet
from
gun
more
than
thousand
one
of
those
we
lost
was
young
girl
named
she
was
years
old
she
loved
fig
and
lip
gloss
she
was
majorette
she
was
so
good
to
her
friends
they
all
thought
they
were
her
best
friend
just
three
weeks
ago
she
was
here
in
washington
with
her
classmates
performing
for
her
country
at
my
inauguration
and
week
later
she
was
shot
and
killed
in
chicago
park
after
school
just
mile
away
from
my
house
parents
and
are
in
this
chamber
tonight
along
with
more
than
two
dozen
americans
whose
lives
have
been
torn
apart
by
gun
violence
they
deserve
vote
they
deserve
vote
deserves
vote
the
families
of
deserve
vote
the
families
of
aurora
deserve
vote
the
families
of
oak
creek
and
and
and
the
countless
other
communities
ripped
open
by
gun
violence
they
deserve
simple
vote
they
deserve
simple
vote
our
actions
will
not
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
in
this
country
in
fact
no
laws
no
initiatives
no
administrative
acts
will
perfectly
solve
all
the
challenges
outlined
tonight
but
we
were
never
sent
here
to
be
perfect
we
were
sent
here
to
make
what
difference
we
can
to
secure
this
nation
expand
opportunity
uphold
our
ideals
through
the
hard
often
frustrating
but
absolutely
necessary
work
of
we
were
sent
here
to
look
out
for
our
fellow
americans
the
same
way
they
look
out
for
one
another
every
single
day
usually
without
fanfare
all
across
this
country
we
should
follow
their
example
we
should
follow
the
example
of
new
york
city
nurse
named
when
hurricane
sandy
plunged
her
hospital
into
darkness
she
thinking
about
how
her
own
home
was
faring
her
mind
was
on
the
precious
in
her
care
and
the
rescue
plan
she
devised
that
kept
them
all
safe
we
should
follow
the
example
of
north
miami
woman
named
victor
when
arrived
at
her
polling
place
she
was
told
the
wait
to
vote
might
be
six
hours
and
as
time
ticked
by
her
concern
was
not
with
her
tired
body
or
aching
feet
but
whether
folks
like
her
would
get
to
have
their
say
and
hour
after
hour
throng
of
people
stayed
in
line
to
support
her
because
is
years
old
and
they
erupted
in
cheers
when
she
finally
put
on
sticker
that
read
we
should
follow
the
example
of
police
officer
named
when
gunman
opened
fire
on
temple
in
and
was
the
first
to
arrive
he
did
not
consider
his
own
safety
he
fought
back
until
help
arrived
and
ordered
his
fellow
officers
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
americans
inside
even
as
he
lay
bleeding
from
bullet
wounds
and
when
asked
how
he
did
that
said
just
the
way
just
the
way
made
we
may
do
different
jobs
and
wear
different
uniforms
and
hold
different
views
than
the
person
beside
us
but
as
americans
we
all
share
the
same
proud
title
we
are
citizens
word
that
just
describe
our
nationality
or
legal
status
it
describes
the
way
made
it
describes
what
we
believe
it
captures
the
enduring
idea
that
this
country
only
works
when
we
accept
certain
obligations
to
one
another
and
to
future
generations
that
our
rights
are
wrapped
up
in
the
rights
of
others
and
that
well
into
our
third
century
as
nation
it
remains
the
task
of
us
all
as
citizens
of
these
united
states
to
be
the
authors
of
the
next
great
chapter
of
our
american
story
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
these
united
states
of
america
well
it
is
good
to
be
back
in
las
and
it
is
good
to
be
among
so
many
good
friends

me
start
off
by
thanking
everybody

high
school
for
hosting
us

me
especially
thank
your
outstanding
principal
there
are
all
kinds
of
notable
guests

but
just
want
to
mention
few
first
of
all
our
outstanding
secretary
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
here
our
wonderful
secretary
of
the
interior
ken
former
secretary
of
two
of
the
outstanding
members
of
the
congressional
delegation
from
and
your
own
mayor
but
we
also
have
some
mayors
that
flew
in
because
they
know
how
important
the
issue
going
to
talk
about
today
is
from
arizona
reed
from
atlanta
georgia
from
phoenix
arizona
and
from
california
and
all
of
you
are
here
as
well
as
some
of
the
top
leaders
in
the
country
and
we
are
just
so
grateful
some
outstanding
business
leaders
are
here
as
well
and
of
course
got
wonderful
students
here
so
could
not
be
prouder
of
our
students
now
those
of
you
have
seat
feel
free
to
take
seat
mind
audience
member
love
you
president
president
love
you
back
now
last
week
had
the
of
being
sworn
in
for
second
term
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
during
my
inaugural
address
talked
about
how
making
progress
on
the
defining
challenges
of
our
time
require
us
to
settle
every
debate
or
ignore
every
difference
that
we
may
have
but
it
does
require
us
to
find
common
ground
and
move
forward
in
common
purpose
it
requires
us
to
act
know
that
some
issues
will
be
harder
to
lift
than
others
some
debates
will
be
more
contentious
to
be
expected
but
the
reason
came
here
today
is
because
of
challenge
where
the
differences
are
dwindling
where
broad
consensus
is
emerging
and
where
call
for
action
can
now
be
heard
coming
from
all
across
america
here
today
because
the
time
has
come
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
the
time
is
now
now
is
the
time
now
is
the
time
now
is
the
time
audience
president
now
is
the
time
here
because
most
americans
agree
that
time
to
fix
system
been
broken
for
way
too
long
here
because
business
leaders
faith
leaders
leaders
law
enforcement
and
leaders
from
both
parties
are
coming
together
to
say
now
is
the
time
to
find
better
way
to
welcome
the
striving
hopeful
immigrants
who
still
see
america
as
the
land
of
opportunity
now
is
the
time
to
do
this
so
we
can
strengthen
our
economy
and
strengthen
our
future
think
about
it
we
define
ourselves
as
nation
of
immigrants
who
we
are
in
our
bones
the
promise
we
see
in
those
who
come
here
from
every
corner
of
the
globe
always
been
one
of
our
greatest
strengths
it
keeps
our
workforce
young
it
keeps
our
country
on
the
cutting
edge
and
helped
build
the
greatest
economic
engine
the
world
has
ever
known
after
all
immigrants
helped
start
businesses
like
and
they
created
entire
new
industries
that
in
turn
created
new
jobs
and
new
prosperity
for
our
citizens
in
recent
years
one
in
four
startups
in
america
were
founded
by
immigrants
one
in
four
new
small
business
owners
were
immigrants
including
right
here
in
folks
who
came
here
seeking
opportunity
and
now
want
to
share
that
opportunity
with
other
americans
but
we
all
know
that
today
we
have
an
immigration
system
out
of
date
and
badly
broken
system
holding
us
back
instead
of
helping
us
grow
our
economy
and
strengthen
our
middle
class
right
now
we
have
million
undocumented
immigrants
in
america
million
men
and
women
from
all
over
the
world
who
live
their
lives
in
the
shadows
yes
they
broke
the
rules
they
crossed
the
border
illegally
maybe
they
their
visas
those
are
facts
nobody
disputes
them
but
these
million
men
and
women
are
now
here
many
of
them
have
been
here
for
years
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
individuals
looking
for
any
trouble
contributing
members
of
the
community
they
looking
out
for
their
families
they
looking
out
for
their
they
woven
into
the
fabric
of
our
lives
every
day
like
the
rest
of
us
they
go
out
and
try
to
earn
living
often
they
do
that
in
shadow
economy
place
where
employers
may
offer
them
less
than
the
minimum
wage
or
make
them
work
overtime
without
extra
pay
and
when
that
happens
not
just
bad
for
them
bad
for
the
entire
economy
because
all
the
businesses
that
are
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
that
are
hiring
people
legally
paying
decent
wage
following
the
rules
the
ones
who
suffer
they
got
to
compete
against
companies
that
are
breaking
the
rules
and
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
american
workers
are
threatened
too
so
if
we
truly
committed
to
strengthening
our
middle
class
and
providing
more
ladders
of
opportunity
to
those
who
are
willing
to
work
hard
to
make
it
into
the
middle
class
we
got
to
fix
the
system
we
have
to
make
sure
that
every
business
and
every
worker
in
america
is
playing
by
the
same
set
of
rules
we
have
to
bring
this
shadow
economy
into
the
light
so
that
everybody
is
held
accountable
businesses
for
who
they
hire
and
immigrants
for
getting
on
the
right
side
of
the
law
common
sense
and
why
we
need
comprehensive
immigration
reform
another
economic
reason
why
we
need
reform
not
just
about
the
folks
who
come
here
illegally
and
have
the
effect
they
have
on
our
economy
also
about
the
folks
who
try
to
come
here
legally
but
have
hard
time
doing
so
and
the
effect
that
has
on
our
economy
right
now
there
are
brilliant
students
from
all
over
the
world
sitting
in
classrooms
at
our
top
universities
earning
degrees
in
the
fields
of
the
future
like
engineering
and
computer
science
but
once
they
finish
school
once
they
earn
that
diploma
good
chance
have
to
leave
our
country
think
about
that
was
started
with
the
help
of
an
immigrant
who
studied
here
and
then
stayed
here
was
started
with
the
help
of
an
immigrant
who
studied
here
and
then
stayed
here
right
now
in
one
of
those
classrooms
student
wrestling
with
how
to
turn
their
big
idea
their
or
into
big
business
giving
them
all
the
skills
they
need
to
figure
that
out
but
then
going
to
turn
around
and
tell
them
to
start
that
business
and
create
those
jobs
in
china
or
india
or
mexico
or
else
not
how
you
grow
new
industries
in
america
how
you
give
new
industries
to
our
competitors
why
we
need
comprehensive
immigration
reform
now
during
my
first
term
we
took
steps
to
try
and
patch
up
some
of
the
worst
cracks
in
the
system
first
we
strengthened
security
at
the
borders
so
that
we
could
finally
stem
the
tide
of
illegal
immigrants
we
put
more
boots
on
the
ground
on
the
southern
border
than
at
any
time
in
our
history
and
today
illegal
crossings
are
down
nearly
percent
from
their
peak
in
second
we
focused
our
enforcement
efforts
on
criminals
who
are
here
illegally
and
who
endanger
our
communities
and
today
deportations
of
criminals
is
at
its
highest
level
ever
and
third
we
took
up
the
cause
of
the
dreamers
the
young
people
who
were
brought
to
this
country
as
children
young
people
who
have
grown
up
here
built
their
lives
here
have
futures
here
we
said
that
if
able
to
meet
some
basic
criteria
like
pursuing
an
education
then
consider
offering
you
the
chance
to
come
out
of
the
shadows
so
that
you
can
live
here
and
work
here
legally
so
that
you
can
finally
have
the
dignity
of
knowing
you
belong
but
because
this
change
permanent
we
need
congress
to
act
and
not
just
on
the
dream
act
we
need
congress
to
act
on
comprehensive
approach
that
finally
deals
with
the
million
undocumented
immigrants
who
are
in
the
country
right
now
that
what
we
need
now
the
good
news
is
that
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
republicans
and
democrats
seem
ready
to
tackle
this
problem
together
members
of
both
parties
in
both
chambers
are
actively
working
on
solution
yesterday
bipartisan
group
of
senators
announced
their
principles
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
which
are
very
much
in
line
with
the
principles
proposed
and
campaigned
on
for
the
last
few
years
so
at
this
moment
it
looks
like
genuine
desire
to
get
this
done
soon
and
very
encouraging
but
this
time
action
must
follow
we
allow
immigration
reform
to
get
bogged
down
in
an
endless
debate
we
been
debating
this
very
long
time
so
it
not
as
if
we
do
know
technically
what
needs
to
get
done
as
consequence
to
help
move
this
process
along
today
laying
out
my
ideas
for
immigration
reform
and
my
hope
is
that
this
provides
some
key
markers
to
members
of
congress
as
they
craft
bill
because
the
ideas
proposing
have
traditionally
been
supported
by
both
democrats
like
ted
kennedy
and
republicans
like
president
george
bush
you
do
get
that
very
often
so
we
know
where
the
consensus
should
be
now
of
course
there
will
be
rigorous
debate
about
many
of
the
details
and
every
stakeholder
should
engage
in
real
give
and
take
in
the
process
but
important
for
us
to
that
the
foundation
for
bipartisan
action
is
already
in
place
and
if
congress
is
unable
to
move
forward
in
timely
fashion
will
send
up
bill
based
on
my
proposal
and
insist
that
they
vote
on
it
right
away
so
the
principles
are
pretty
straightforward
there
are
lot
of
details
behind
it
we
going
to
hand
out
bunch
of
paper
so
that
everybody
will
know
exactly
what
we
talking
about
but
the
principles
are
pretty
straightforward
first
believe
we
need
to
stay
focused
on
enforcement
that
means
continuing
to
strengthen
security
at
our
borders
it
means
cracking
down
more
forcefully
on
businesses
that
knowingly
hire
undocumented
workers
to
be
fair
most
businesses
want
to
do
the
right
thing
but
lot
of
them
have
hard
time
figuring
out
here
legally
not
so
we
need
to
implement
national
system
that
allows
businesses
to
quickly
and
accurately
verify
employment
status
and
if
they
still
knowingly
hire
undocumented
workers
then
we
need
to
ramp
up
the
penalties
second
we
have
to
deal
with
the
million
individuals
who
are
here
illegally
we
all
agree
that
these
men
and
women
should
have
to
earn
their
way
to
citizenship
but
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
to
work
it
must
be
clear
from
the
outset
that
there
is
pathway
to
citizenship
got
to
lay
out
path
process
that
includes
passing
background
check
paying
taxes
paying
penalty
learning
english
and
then
going
to
the
back
of
the
line
behind
all
the
folks
who
are
trying
to
come
here
legally
that
only
fair
right
so
that
means
it
be
quick
process
but
it
will
be
fair
process
and
it
will
lift
these
individuals
out
of
the
shadows
and
give
them
chance
to
earn
their
way
to
green
card
and
eventually
to
citizenship
and
the
third
principle
is
got
to
bring
our
legal
immigration
system
into
the
century
because
it
no
longer
reflects
the
realities
of
our
time
for
example
if
you
are
citizen
you
have
to
wait
years
before
your
family
is
able
to
join
you
in
america
you
should
have
to
wait
years
if
foreign
student
who
wants
to
pursue
career
in
science
or
technology
or
foreign
entrepreneur
who
wants
to
start
business
with
the
backing
of
american
investors
we
should
help
you
do
that
here
because
if
you
succeed
create
american
businesses
and
american
jobs
help
us
grow
our
economy
help
us
strengthen
our
middle
class
so
what
comprehensive
immigration
reform
looks
like
smarter
enforcement
pathway
to
earned
citizenship
improvements
in
the
legal
immigration
system
so
that
we
continue
to
be
magnet
for
the
best
and
the
brightest
all
around
the
world
pretty
straightforward
the
question
now
is
simple
do
we
have
the
resolve
as
people
as
country
as
government
to
finally
put
this
issue
behind
us
believe
that
we
do
believe
that
we
do
believe
we
are
finally
at
moment
where
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
within
our
grasp
but
promise
you
this
the
closer
we
get
the
more
emotional
this
debate
is
going
to
become
immigration
has
always
been
an
issue
that
passions
not
surprising
there
are
few
things
that
are
more
important
to
us
as
society
than
who
gets
to
come
here
and
call
our
country
home
who
gets
the
privilege
of
becoming
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
that
big
deal
when
we
talk
about
that
in
the
abstract
easy
sometimes
for
the
discussion
to
take
on
feeling
of
versus
and
when
that
happens
lot
of
folks
forget
that
most
of
used
to
be
we
forget
that
really
important
for
us
to
remember
our
history
unless
one
of
the
first
americans
native
american
you
came
from
else
somebody
brought
you
ken
of
mexican
american
descent
but
he
points
that
his
family
has
been
living
where
he
lives
for
years
so
he
did
immigrate
anywhere
the
irish
who
left
behind
land
of
famine
the
germans
who
fled
persecution
the
who
arrived
eager
to
pioneer
out
west
the
polish
the
the
italians
the
chinese
the
the
west
indians
the
huddled
masses
who
came
through
island
on
one
coast
and
angel
island
on
the
other
all
those
folks
before
they
were
they
were
and
when
each
new
wave
of
immigrants
arrived
they
faced
resistance
from
those
who
were
already
here
they
faced
hardship
they
faced
racism
they
faced
ridicule
but
over
time
as
they
went
about
their
daily
lives
as
they
earned
living
as
they
raised
family
as
they
built
community
as
their
kids
went
to
school
here
they
did
their
part
to
build
nation
they
were
the
and
the
but
they
were
also
the
millions
of
women
and
men
whose
names
history
may
not
remember
but
whose
actions
helped
make
us
who
we
are
who
built
this
country
hand
by
hand
brick
by
brick
they
all
came
here
knowing
that
what
makes
somebody
an
american
is
not
just
blood
or
birth
but
allegiance
to
our
founding
principles
and
the
faith
in
the
idea
that
anyone
from
anywhere
can
write
the
next
great
chapter
of
our
story
and
still
true
today
just
ask
is
here
this
afternoon
where
is
he
around
here
there
he
is
right
here
was
born
in
mexico
he
was
brought
to
this
country
by
his
parents
when
he
was
child
growing
up
went
to
an
american
school
pledged
allegiance
to
the
american
flag
felt
american
in
every
way
and
he
was
except
for
one
on
paper
in
high
school
watched
his
friends
come
of
age
driving
around
town
with
their
new
licenses
earning
some
extra
cash
from
their
summer
jobs
at
the
mall
he
knew
he
do
those
things
but
it
matter
that
much
what
mattered
to
was
earning
an
education
so
that
he
could
live
up
to
his
potential
last
year
when
heard
the
news
that
we
were
going
to
offer
chance
for
folks
like
him
to
emerge
from
the
shadows
even
if
it
just
for
two
years
at
time
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
sign
up
and
few
months
ago
he
was
one
of
the
first
people
in
to
get
approved
in
that
moment
said
felt
the
fear
vanish
felt
so
today
is
in
his
second
year
at
the
college
of
southern
is
studying
to
become
doctor
he
hopes
to
join
the
air
force
working
hard
every
single
day
to
build
better
life
for
himself
and
his
family
and
all
he
wants
is
the
opportunity
to
do
his
part
to
build
better
america
so
in
the
coming
weeks
as
the
idea
of
reform
becomes
more
real
and
the
debate
becomes
more
heated
and
there
are
folks
who
are
trying
to
pull
this
thing
apart
remember
and
all
those
who
share
the
same
hopes
and
the
same
dreams
remember
that
this
is
not
just
debate
about
policy
about
people
about
men
and
women
and
young
people
who
want
nothing
more
than
the
chance
to
earn
their
way
into
the
american
story
throughout
our
history
that
has
only
made
our
nation
stronger
and
how
we
will
make
sure
that
this
century
is
the
same
as
the
last
an
american
century
welcoming
of
everybody
who
aspires
to
do
something
more
and
who
is
willing
to
work
hard
to
do
it
and
is
willing
to
pledge
that
allegiance
to
our
flag
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
thank
you
so
much
vice
president
chief
justice
members
of
the
united
states
congress
distinguished
guests
and
fellow
citizens
each
time
we
gather
to
inaugurate
president
we
bear
witness
to
the
enduring
strength
of
our
constitution
we
affirm
the
promise
of
our
democracy
we
recall
that
what
binds
this
nation
together
is
not
the
of
our
skin
or
the
tenets
of
our
faith
or
the
origins
of
our
names
what
makes
us
exceptional
what
makes
us
america
is
our
allegiance
to
an
idea
articulated
in
declaration
made
more
than
two
centuries
ago
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
today
we
continue
never
ending
journey
to
bridge
the
meaning
of
those
words
with
the
realities
of
our
time
for
history
tells
us
that
while
these
truths
may
be
never
been
that
while
freedom
is
gift
from
god
it
must
be
secured
by
his
people
here
on
earth
the
patriots
of
did
not
fight
to
replace
the
tyranny
of
king
with
the
privileges
of
few
or
the
rule
of
mob
they
gave
to
us
republic
government
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
entrusting
each
generation
to
keep
safe
our
founding
creed
and
for
more
than
years
we
have
through
blood
drawn
by
lash
and
blood
drawn
by
sword
we
noted
that
no
union
founded
on
the
principles
of
liberty
and
equality
could
survive
half
slave
and
half
free
we
made
ourselves
anew
and
vowed
to
move
forward
together
together
we
determined
that
modern
economy
requires
and
highways
to
speed
travel
and
commerce
schools
and
colleges
to
train
our
workers
together
we
discovered
that
free
market
only
thrives
when
there
are
rules
to
ensure
competition
and
fair
play
together
we
resolve
that
great
nation
must
care
for
the
vulnerable
and
protect
its
people
from
worst
hazards
and
misfortune
through
it
all
we
have
never
relinquished
our
of
central
authority
nor
have
we
succumbed
to
the
fiction
that
all
societies
ills
can
be
cured
through
government
alone
our
celebration
of
initiative
and
enterprise
our
insistence
on
hard
work
and
personal
responsibility
these
are
constants
in
our
character
but
we
have
always
understood
that
when
times
change
so
must
we
that
fidelity
to
our
founding
principles
requires
new
responses
to
new
challenges
that
preserving
our
individual
freedoms
ultimately
requires
collective
action
for
the
american
people
can
no
more
meet
the
demands
of
world
by
acting
alone
than
american
soldiers
could
have
met
the
forces
of
fascism
or
communism
with
muskets
and
militias
no
single
person
can
train
all
the
math
and
science
teachers
need
to
equip
our
children
for
the
future
or
build
the
roads
and
networks
and
research
labs
that
will
bring
new
jobs
and
businesses
to
our
shores
now
more
than
ever
we
must
do
these
things
together
as
one
nation
and
one
people
this
generation
of
americans
has
been
tested
by
crises
that
steeled
our
resolve
and
proved
our
resilience
decade
of
war
is
now
ending
an
economic
recovery
has
begun
possibilities
are
limitless
for
we
possess
all
the
qualities
that
this
world
without
boundaries
demands
youth
and
drive
diversity
and
openness
an
endless
capacity
for
risk
and
gift
for
reinvention
my
fellow
americans
we
are
made
for
this
moment
and
we
will
seize
it
so
long
as
we
seize
it
together
for
we
the
people
understand
that
our
country
can
not
succeed
when
shrinking
few
do
very
well
and
growing
many
barely
make
it
we
believe
that
prosperity
must
rest
upon
the
broad
shoulders
of
rising
middle
class
we
know
that
america
thrives
when
every
person
can
find
independence
and
pride
in
their
work
when
the
wages
of
honest
liberate
families
from
the
brink
of
hardship
we
are
true
to
our
creed
when
little
girl
born
into
the
bleakest
poverty
knows
that
she
has
the
same
chance
to
succeed
as
anybody
else
because
she
is
an
american
she
is
free
and
she
is
equal
not
just
in
the
eyes
of
god
but
also
in
our
own
we
understand
that
programs
are
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
our
time
so
we
must
harness
new
ideas
and
technology
to
remake
our
government
revamp
our
tax
code
reform
our
schools
and
empower
our
citizens
with
the
skills
they
need
to
work
harder
learn
more
reach
higher
but
while
the
means
will
change
our
purpose
endures
nation
that
rewards
the
effort
and
determination
of
every
single
american
that
is
what
this
moment
requires
that
is
what
will
give
real
meaning
to
our
creed
we
the
people
still
believe
that
every
citizen
deserves
basic
measure
of
security
and
dignity
we
must
make
the
hard
choices
to
reduce
the
cost
of
health
care
and
the
size
of
our
deficit
but
we
reject
the
belief
that
america
must
choose
between
caring
for
the
generation
that
built
this
country
and
investing
in
the
generation
that
will
build
its
future
for
we
remember
the
lessons
of
our
past
when
twilight
years
were
spent
in
poverty
and
parents
of
child
with
disability
had
nowhere
to
turn
we
do
not
believe
that
in
this
country
freedom
is
reserved
for
the
lucky
or
happiness
for
the
few
we
that
no
matter
how
responsibly
we
live
our
lives
any
one
of
us
at
any
time
may
face
job
loss
or
sudden
illness
or
home
swept
away
in
terrible
storm
the
commitments
we
make
to
each
other
through
and
and
social
security
these
things
do
not
sap
our
initiative
they
strengthen
us
they
do
not
make
us
nation
of
takers
they
free
us
to
take
the
risks
that
make
this
country
great
we
the
people
still
believe
that
our
obligations
as
americans
are
not
just
to
ourselves
but
to
all
posterity
we
will
respond
to
the
threat
of
climate
change
knowing
that
the
failure
to
do
so
would
betray
our
children
and
future
generations
some
may
still
deny
the
overwhelming
judgment
of
science
but
none
can
avoid
the
devastating
impact
of
raging
fires
and
crippling
drought
and
more
powerful
storms
the
path
towards
sustainable
energy
sources
will
be
long
and
sometimes
difficult
but
america
can
not
resist
this
transition
we
must
lead
it
we
can
not
cede
to
other
nations
the
technology
that
will
power
new
jobs
and
new
industries
we
must
claim
its
promise
how
we
will
maintain
our
economic
vitality
and
our
national
treasure
our
forests
and
waterways
our
crop
lands
and
peaks
that
is
how
we
will
preserve
our
planet
commanded
to
our
care
by
god
what
will
lend
meaning
to
the
creed
our
fathers
once
declared
we
the
people
still
believe
that
enduring
security
and
lasting
peace
do
not
require
perpetual
war
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
tempered
by
the
flames
of
battle
are
unmatched
in
skill
and
courage
our
citizens
seared
by
the
memory
of
those
we
have
lost
know
too
well
the
price
that
is
paid
for
liberty
the
knowledge
of
their
sacrifice
will
keep
us
forever
vigilant
against
those
who
would
do
us
harm
but
we
are
also
heirs
to
those
who
won
the
peace
and
not
just
the
war
who
turned
sworn
enemies
into
the
surest
of
friends
and
we
must
carry
those
lessons
into
this
time
as
well
we
will
defend
our
people
and
uphold
our
values
through
strength
of
arms
and
rule
of
law
we
will
show
the
courage
to
try
and
resolve
our
differences
with
other
nations
peacefully
not
because
we
are
about
the
dangers
we
face
but
because
engagement
can
more
lift
suspicion
and
fear
america
will
remain
the
anchor
of
strong
alliances
in
every
corner
of
the
globe
and
we
will
renew
those
institutions
that
extend
our
capacity
to
manage
crisis
abroad
for
no
one
has
greater
stake
in
peaceful
world
than
its
most
powerful
nation
we
will
support
democracy
from
asia
to
africa
from
the
to
the
middle
east
because
our
interests
and
our
conscience
compel
us
to
act
on
behalf
of
those
who
long
for
freedom
and
we
must
be
source
of
hope
to
the
poor
the
sick
the
the
victims
of
prejudice
not
out
of
mere
charity
but
because
peace
in
our
time
requires
the
constant
advance
of
those
principles
that
our
common
creed
describes
tolerance
and
opportunity
human
dignity
and
justice
we
the
people
declare
today
that
the
most
evident
of
truths
that
all
of
us
are
created
equal
is
the
star
that
guides
us
still
just
as
it
guided
our
forebears
through
falls
and
and
just
as
it
guided
all
those
men
and
women
sung
and
unsung
who
left
footprints
along
this
great
mall
to
hear
preacher
say
that
we
can
not
walk
alone
to
hear
king
proclaim
that
our
individual
freedom
is
inextricably
bound
to
the
freedom
of
every
soul
on
earth
it
is
now
our
task
to
carry
on
what
those
pioneers
began
for
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
our
wives
our
mothers
and
daughters
can
earn
living
equal
to
their
efforts
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
our
gay
brothers
and
sisters
are
treated
like
anyone
else
under
the
law
for
if
we
are
truly
created
equal
then
surely
the
love
we
commit
to
one
another
must
be
equal
as
well
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
no
citizen
is
forced
to
wait
for
hours
to
exercise
the
right
to
vote
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
we
find
better
way
to
welcome
the
striving
hopeful
immigrants
who
still
see
america
as
land
of
opportunity
until
bright
young
students
and
engineers
are
enlisted
in
our
workforce
rather
than
expelled
from
our
country
our
journey
is
not
complete
until
all
our
children
from
the
streets
of
detroit
to
the
hills
of
to
the
quiet
lanes
of
know
that
they
are
cared
for
and
cherished
and
always
safe
from
harm
that
is
our
task
to
make
these
words
these
rights
these
values
of
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
real
for
every
american
being
true
to
our
founding
documents
does
not
require
us
to
agree
on
every
contour
of
life
it
does
not
mean
we
all
define
liberty
in
exactly
the
same
way
or
follow
the
same
precise
path
to
happiness
progress
does
not
compel
us
to
settle
debates
about
the
role
of
government
for
all
time
but
it
does
require
us
to
act
in
our
time
for
now
decisions
are
upon
us
and
we
can
not
afford
delay
we
can
not
mistake
absolutism
for
principle
or
substitute
spectacle
for
politics
or
treat
as
reasoned
debate
we
must
act
knowing
that
our
work
will
be
imperfect
we
must
act
knowing
that
victories
will
be
only
partial
and
that
it
will
be
up
to
those
who
stand
here
in
four
years
and
years
and
years
hence
to
advance
the
timeless
spirit
once
conferred
to
us
in
spare
hall
my
fellow
americans
the
oath
have
sworn
before
you
today
like
the
one
recited
by
others
who
serve
in
this
capitol
was
an
oath
to
god
and
country
not
party
or
faction
and
we
must
faithfully
execute
that
pledge
during
the
duration
of
our
service
but
the
words
spoke
today
are
not
so
different
from
the
oath
that
is
taken
each
time
soldier
signs
up
for
duty
or
an
immigrant
her
dream
my
oath
is
not
so
different
from
the
pledge
we
all
make
to
the
flag
that
waves
above
and
that
fills
our
hearts
with
pride
they
are
the
words
of
citizens
and
they
represent
our
greatest
hope
you
and
as
citizens
have
the
power
to
set
this
course
you
and
as
citizens
have
the
obligation
to
shape
the
debates
of
our
time
not
only
with
the
votes
we
cast
but
with
the
voices
we
lift
in
of
our
most
ancient
values
and
enduring
ideals
let
us
each
of
us
now
embrace
with
solemn
duty
and
awesome
joy
what
is
our
lasting
birthright
with
common
effort
and
common
purpose
with
passion
and
dedication
let
us
answer
the
call
of
history
and
carry
into
an
uncertain
future
that
precious
light
of
freedom
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
may
he
forever
bless
these
united
states
of
america
thank
you
everybody
please
please
have
seat
good
afternoon
everybody
let
me
begin
by
thanking
our
vice
president
for
your
dedication
to
this
issue
for
bringing
so
many
different
voices
to
the
table
because
while
reducing
gun
violence
is
complicated
challenge
protecting
our
children
from
harm
be
divisive
one
over
the
month
since
the
tragedy
in
heard
from
so
many
and
obviously
none
have
affected
us
more
than
the
families
of
those
gorgeous
children
and
their
teachers
and
guardians
who
were
lost
and
so
grateful
to
all
of
you
for
taking
the
time
to
be
here
and
that
we
their
memories
in
part
by
doing
everything
we
can
to
prevent
this
from
happening
again
but
we
also
heard
from
some
unexpected
people
in
particular
started
getting
lot
of
letters
from
kids
four
of
them
are
here
today
grant
stokes
and
pretty
representative
of
some
of
the
messages
that
got
these
are
some
pretty
smart
letters
from
some
pretty
smart
young
people
you
can
go
ahead
and
wave
you
wrote
feel
terrible
for
the
parents
who
lost
their
love
my
country
and
want
everybody
to
be
happy
and
and
then
grant
go
ahead
and
wave
grant
grant
said
think
there
should
be
some
changes
we
should
learn
from
what
happened
at
sandy
feel
really
and
then
said
where
are
you
there
you
go
not
scared
for
my
safety
scared
for
others
have
four
brothers
and
sisters
and
know
would
not
be
able
to
bear
the
thought
of
losing
any
of
these
are
our
kids
this
is
what
thinking
about
and
so
what
we
should
be
thinking
about
is
our
responsibility
to
care
for
them
and
shield
them
from
harm
and
give
them
the
tools
they
need
to
grow
up
and
do
everything
that
capable
of
doing
not
just
to
pursue
their
own
dreams
but
to
help
build
this
country
this
is
our
first
task
as
society
keeping
our
children
safe
this
is
how
we
will
be
judged
and
their
voices
should
compel
us
to
change
and
why
last
month
asked
to
lead
an
effort
along
with
members
of
my
cabinet
to
come
up
with
some
concrete
steps
we
can
take
right
now
to
keep
our
children
safe
to
help
prevent
mass
shootings
to
reduce
the
broader
epidemic
of
gun
violence
in
this
country
and
we
put
this
off
any
longer
just
last
thursday
as
networks
were
covering
one
of
meetings
on
this
topic
news
broke
of
another
school
shooting
this
one
in
california
in
the
month
since
precious
children
and
six
brave
adults
were
violently
taken
from
us
at
sandy
hook
elementary
more
than
of
our
fellow
americans
have
reportedly
died
at
the
end
of
gun
in
the
past
month
and
every
day
we
wait
that
number
will
keep
growing
so
putting
forward
specific
set
of
proposals
based
on
the
work
of
task
force
and
in
the
days
ahead
intend
to
use
whatever
weight
this
office
holds
to
make
them
reality
because
while
there
is
no
law
or
set
of
laws
that
can
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
completely
no
piece
of
legislation
that
will
prevent
every
tragedy
every
act
of
evil
if
there
is
even
one
thing
we
can
do
to
reduce
this
violence
if
there
is
even
one
life
that
can
be
saved
then
we
got
an
obligation
to
try
and
going
to
do
my
part
as
soon
as
finished
speaking
here
will
sit
at
that
desk
and
will
sign
directive
giving
law
enforcement
schools
mental
health
professionals
and
the
public
health
community
some
of
the
tools
they
need
to
help
reduce
gun
violence
we
will
make
it
easier
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
by
strengthening
the
background
check
system
we
will
help
schools
hire
more
resource
officers
if
they
want
them
and
develop
emergency
preparedness
plans
we
will
make
sure
mental
health
professionals
know
their
options
for
reporting
threats
of
violence
even
as
we
acknowledge
that
someone
with
mental
illness
is
far
more
likely
to
be
victim
of
violent
crime
than
the
perpetrator
and
while
year
after
year
those
who
oppose
even
modest
gun
safety
measures
have
threatened
to
scientific
or
medical
research
into
the
causes
of
gun
violence
will
direct
the
for
disease
control
to
go
ahead
and
study
the
best
ways
to
reduce
it
and
congress
should
fund
research
into
the
effects
that
violent
video
games
have
on
young
minds
we
do
benefit
from
ignorance
we
do
benefit
from
not
knowing
the
science
of
this
epidemic
of
violence
these
are
few
of
the
executive
actions
that
announcing
today
but
as
important
as
these
steps
are
they
are
in
no
way
substitute
for
action
from
members
of
congress
to
make
real
and
lasting
difference
congress
too
must
act
and
congress
must
act
soon
and
calling
on
congress
to
pass
some
very
specific
proposals
right
away
first
time
for
congress
to
require
universal
background
check
for
anyone
trying
to
buy
gun
the
law
already
requires
licensed
gun
dealers
to
run
background
checks
and
over
the
last
years
kept
million
of
the
wrong
people
from
getting
their
hands
on
gun
but
hard
to
enforce
that
law
when
as
many
as
percent
of
all
gun
purchases
are
conducted
without
background
check
not
safe
that
not
smart
not
fair
to
responsible
gun
buyers
or
sellers
if
you
want
to
buy
gun
whether
from
licensed
dealer
or
private
seller
you
should
at
least
have
to
show
you
are
not
felon
or
somebody
legally
prohibited
from
buying
one
this
is
common
sense
and
an
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
agree
with
us
on
the
need
for
universal
background
checks
including
more
than
percent
of
the
national
rifle
members
according
to
one
survey
so
no
reason
we
do
this
second
congress
should
restore
ban
on
assault
weapons
and
limit
for
magazines
the
type
of
assault
rifle
used
in
aurora
for
example
when
paired
with
magazines
has
one
purpose
to
pump
out
as
many
bullets
as
possible
as
quickly
as
possible
to
do
as
much
damage
using
bullets
often
designed
to
inflict
maximum
damage
and
that
what
allowed
the
gunman
in
aurora
to
shoot
people
people
killing
in
matter
of
minutes
weapons
designed
for
the
of
war
have
no
place
in
movie
majority
of
americans
agree
with
us
on
this
and
by
the
way
so
did
one
of
the
staunchest
defenders
of
the
second
amendment
who
wrote
to
congress
in
urging
them
this
is
speaking
urging
them
to
to
the
american
public
and
to
the
law
enforcement
community
and
support
ban
on
the
further
manufacture
of
assault
and
finally
congress
needs
to
help
rather
than
hinder
law
enforcement
as
it
does
its
job
we
should
get
tougher
on
people
who
buy
guns
with
the
express
purpose
of
turning
around
and
selling
them
to
criminals
and
we
should
severely
punish
anybody
who
helps
them
do
this
since
congress
confirmed
director
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
in
six
years
they
should
confirm
who
will
be
who
has
been
acting
and
will
be
nominating
for
the
post
and
at
time
when
budget
cuts
are
forcing
many
communities
to
reduce
their
police
force
we
should
put
more
cops
back
on
the
job
and
back
on
our
streets
let
me
be
absolutely
clear
like
most
americans
believe
the
second
amendment
guarantees
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms
respect
our
strong
tradition
of
gun
ownership
and
the
rights
of
hunters
and
sportsmen
there
are
millions
of
responsible
gun
owners
in
america
who
cherish
their
right
to
bear
arms
for
hunting
or
sport
or
protection
or
collection
also
believe
most
gun
owners
agree
that
we
can
respect
the
second
amendment
while
keeping
an
irresponsible
few
from
inflicting
harm
on
massive
scale
believe
most
of
them
agree
that
if
america
worked
harder
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
there
would
be
fewer
atrocities
like
the
one
that
occurred
in
what
these
reforms
are
designed
to
do
measures
they
have
the
support
of
the
majority
of
the
american
people
and
yet
that
mean
any
of
this
is
going
to
be
easy
to
enact
or
implement
if
it
were
already
have
universal
background
checks
the
ban
on
assault
weapons
and
magazines
never
would
have
been
allowed
to
expire
more
of
our
fellow
americans
might
still
be
alive
celebrating
birthdays
and
anniversaries
and
graduations
this
will
be
difficult
there
will
be
pundits
and
politicians
and
special
interest
lobbyists
publicly
warning
of
tyrannical
assault
on
liberty
not
because
true
but
because
they
want
to
gin
up
fear
or
higher
ratings
or
revenue
for
themselves
and
behind
the
scenes
do
everything
they
can
to
block
any
reform
and
make
sure
nothing
changes
whatsoever
the
only
way
we
will
be
able
to
change
is
if
their
audience
their
constituents
their
membership
says
this
time
must
be
different
that
this
time
we
must
do
something
to
protect
our
communities
and
our
kids
will
put
everything
got
into
this
and
so
will
but
tell
you
the
only
way
we
can
change
is
if
the
american
people
demand
it
and
by
the
way
that
just
mean
from
certain
parts
of
the
country
we
going
to
need
voices
in
those
areas
in
those
congressional
districts
where
the
tradition
of
gun
ownership
is
strong
to
speak
up
and
to
say
this
is
important
it
just
be
the
usual
suspects
we
have
to
examine
ourselves
and
our
hearts
and
ask
ourselves
what
is
important
this
will
not
happen
unless
the
american
people
demand
it
if
parents
and
teachers
police
officers
and
pastors
if
hunters
and
sportsmen
if
responsible
gun
owners
if
americans
of
every
background
stand
up
and
say
enough
suffered
too
much
pain
and
care
too
much
about
our
children
to
allow
this
to
continue
then
change
will
come
that
what
it
going
to
take
in
the
letter
that
wrote
me
she
said
know
that
laws
have
to
be
passed
by
congress
but
beg
you
to
try
very
will
try
very
hard
but
right
the
most
important
changes
we
can
make
depend
on
congressional
action
they
need
to
bring
these
proposals
up
for
vote
and
the
american
people
need
to
make
sure
that
they
do
get
them
on
record
ask
your
member
of
congress
if
they
support
universal
background
checks
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
wrong
hands
ask
them
if
they
support
renewing
ban
on
assault
weapons
and
magazines
and
if
they
say
no
ask
them
why
not
ask
them
more
important
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
get
grade
from
the
gun
lobby
that
funds
their
campaigns
or
giving
parents
some
peace
of
mind
when
they
drop
their
child
off
for
first
grade
this
is
the
land
of
the
free
and
it
always
will
be
as
americans
we
are
endowed
by
our
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
that
no
man
or
government
can
take
away
from
us
but
we
also
long
as
our
founders
that
with
rights
come
responsibilities
along
with
our
freedom
to
live
our
lives
as
we
will
comes
an
obligation
to
allow
others
to
do
the
same
we
live
in
isolation
we
live
in
society
government
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
we
are
responsible
for
each
other
the
right
to
worship
freely
and
safely
that
right
was
denied
to
in
oak
creek
the
right
to
assemble
peaceably
that
right
was
denied
shoppers
in
and
in
aurora
that
most
fundamental
set
of
rights
to
life
and
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
fundamental
rights
that
were
denied
to
college
students
at
virginia
tech
and
high
school
students
at
and
elementary
school
students
in
and
kids
on
street
corners
in
chicago
on
too
frequent
basis
to
tolerate
and
all
the
families
never
imagined
that
lose
loved
one
to
bullet
those
rights
are
at
stake
responsible
when
visited
last
month
spent
some
private
time
with
many
of
the
families
who
lost
their
children
that
day
and
one
was
the
family
of
grace
parents
are
here
grace
was
seven
years
old
when
she
was
struck
down
just
gorgeous
caring
joyful
little
girl
told
she
loved
pink
she
loved
the
beach
she
dreamed
of
becoming
painter
and
so
just
before
left
her
father
gave
me
one
of
her
paintings
and
hung
it
in
my
private
study
just
off
the
oval
office
and
every
time
look
at
that
painting
think
about
grace
and
think
about
the
life
that
she
lived
and
the
life
that
lay
ahead
of
her
and
most
of
all
think
about
how
when
it
comes
to
protecting
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
we
must
act
now
for
grace
for
the
other
innocent
children
and
devoted
educators
who
had
so
much
left
to
give
for
the
men
and
women
in
big
cities
and
small
towns
who
fall
victim
to
senseless
violence
each
and
every
day
for
all
the
americans
who
are
counting
on
us
to
keep
them
safe
from
harm
do
the
right
thing
do
the
right
thing
for
them
and
for
this
country
that
we
love
so
much
thank
you
sign
these
orders
please
have
seat
everybody
good
morning
thought
it
might
make
sense
to
take
some
questions
this
week
as
my
first
term
comes
to
an
end
been
busy
and
productive
four
years
and
expect
the
same
for
the
next
four
years
intend
to
carry
out
the
agenda
that
campaigned
on
an
agenda
for
new
jobs
new
opportunity
and
new
security
for
the
middle
class
right
now
our
economy
is
growing
and
our
businesses
are
creating
new
jobs
so
we
are
poised
for
good
year
if
we
make
smart
decisions
and
sound
investments
and
as
long
as
washington
politics
get
in
the
way
of
progress
as
said
on
the
campaign
one
component
to
growing
our
economy
and
broadening
opportunity
for
the
middle
class
is
shrinking
our
deficits
in
balanced
and
responsible
way
and
for
nearly
two
years
now
been
fighting
for
such
plan
one
that
would
reduce
our
deficits
by
trillion
over
the
next
decade
which
would
our
debt
and
our
deficit
in
sustainable
way
for
the
next
decade
that
would
be
enough
not
only
to
stop
the
growth
of
our
debt
relative
to
the
size
of
our
economy
but
it
would
make
it
manageable
so
it
crowd
out
the
investments
we
need
to
make
in
people
and
education
and
job
training
and
science
and
medical
research
all
the
things
that
help
us
grow
now
step
by
step
made
progress
towards
that
goal
over
the
past
two
years
signed
into
law
about
trillion
in
spending
cuts
two
weeks
ago
signed
into
law
more
than
billion
in
new
revenue
by
making
sure
the
wealthiest
americans
begin
to
pay
their
fair
share
when
you
add
the
money
that
save
in
interest
payments
on
the
debt
all
together
that
adds
up
to
total
of
about
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
over
the
past
two
years
not
counting
the
billion
already
saved
from
winding
down
the
wars
in
iraq
and
so
we
made
progress
we
are
moving
towards
our
ultimate
goal
of
getting
to
trillion
reduction
and
there
will
be
more
deficit
reduction
when
congress
decides
what
to
do
about
the
trillion
in
automatic
spending
cuts
that
have
been
pushed
off
until
next
month
the
fact
is
though
we
finish
the
job
of
deficit
reduction
through
spending
cuts
alone
the
cuts
already
made
to
priorities
other
than
social
security
and
mean
that
we
spend
on
everything
from
education
to
public
safety
less
as
share
of
our
economy
than
it
has
than
has
been
true
for
generation
and
not
recipe
for
growth
so
got
to
do
more
both
to
our
finances
over
the
medium
and
long
term
but
also
spur
more
growth
in
the
short
term
said
open
to
making
modest
adjustments
to
programs
like
to
protect
them
for
future
generations
also
said
that
we
need
more
revenue
through
tax
reform
by
closing
loopholes
in
our
tax
code
for
the
wealthiest
americans
if
we
combine
balanced
package
of
savings
from
spending
on
health
care
and
revenues
from
closing
loopholes
we
can
solve
the
deficit
issue
without
sacrificing
our
investments
in
things
like
education
that
are
going
to
help
us
grow
it
turns
out
the
american
people
agree
with
me
they
listened
to
an
entire
debate
over
this
issue
and
they
made
clear
decision
about
the
approach
they
prefer
they
think
fair
for
example
to
ask
senior
to
pay
more
for
his
or
her
health
care
or
scientist
to
shut
down
lifesaving
research
so
that
investor
can
pay
less
in
tax
rates
than
secretary
they
think
smart
to
protect
endless
corporate
loopholes
and
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthiest
americans
rather
than
rebuild
our
roads
and
our
schools
invest
in
our
skills
or
help
manufacturers
bring
jobs
back
to
america
so
they
want
us
to
get
our
books
in
order
in
balanced
way
where
everybody
pulls
their
weight
everyone
does
their
part
that
what
want
as
well
that
what
proposed
and
we
can
get
it
done
but
we
going
to
have
to
make
sure
that
people
are
looking
at
this
in
responsible
way
rather
than
just
through
the
lens
of
politics
now
the
other
imposed
deadline
coming
up
is
the
debt
ceiling
something
most
americans
even
heard
of
before
two
years
ago
want
to
be
clear
about
this
the
debt
ceiling
is
not
question
of
more
spending
raising
the
debt
ceiling
does
not
more
spending
it
simply
allows
the
country
to
pay
for
spending
that
congress
has
already
committed
to
these
are
bills
that
have
already
been
racked
up
and
we
need
to
pay
them
so
while
willing
to
compromise
and
find
common
ground
over
how
to
reduce
our
deficits
america
can
not
afford
another
debate
with
this
congress
about
whether
or
not
they
should
pay
the
bills
already
racked
up
if
congressional
republicans
refuse
to
pay
bills
on
time
social
security
checks
and
benefits
will
be
delayed
we
might
not
be
able
to
pay
our
troops
or
our
contracts
with
small
business
owners
food
inspectors
air
traffic
controllers
specialists
who
track
down
loose
nuclear
material
get
their
investors
around
the
world
will
ask
if
the
united
states
of
america
is
in
fact
safe
bet
markets
could
go
haywire
interest
rates
would
spike
for
anybody
who
borrows
money
every
homeowner
with
mortgage
every
student
with
college
loan
every
small
business
owner
who
wants
to
grow
and
hire
it
would
be
wound
on
the
economy
it
would
slow
down
our
growth
might
tip
us
into
recession
and
ironically
would
probably
increase
our
deficit
so
to
even
entertain
the
idea
of
this
happening
of
the
united
states
of
america
not
paying
its
bills
is
irresponsible
absurd
as
the
speaker
said
two
years
ago
it
would
be
and
quoting
speaker
now
financial
disaster
not
only
for
us
but
for
the
worldwide
so
we
got
to
pay
our
bills
and
republicans
in
congress
have
two
choices
here
they
can
act
responsibly
and
pay
bills
or
they
can
act
irresponsibly
and
put
america
through
another
economic
crisis
but
they
will
not
collect
ransom
in
exchange
for
not
crashing
the
american
economy
the
financial
of
the
american
people
is
not
leverage
to
be
used
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
not
bargaining
chip
and
they
better
choose
quickly
because
time
is
running
short
the
last
time
republicans
in
congress
even
flirted
with
this
idea
our
credit
rating
was
downgraded
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
our
businesses
created
the
fewest
jobs
of
any
month
in
nearly
the
past
three
years
and
ironically
the
whole
fiasco
actually
added
to
the
deficit
so
it
be
surprising
given
all
this
talk
that
the
american
people
think
washington
is
hurting
rather
than
helping
the
country
at
the
moment
they
see
their
representatives
consumed
with
partisan
over
paying
our
bills
while
they
overwhelmingly
want
us
to
focus
on
growing
the
economy
and
creating
more
jobs
so
finish
this
debate
give
our
businesses
and
the
world
the
certainty
that
our
economy
and
our
reputation
are
still
second
to
none
we
pay
our
bills
we
handle
our
business
and
then
we
can
move
on
because
america
has
lot
to
do
got
to
create
more
jobs
we
got
to
boost
the
wages
of
those
who
have
work
got
to
reach
for
energy
independence
we
got
to
reform
our
immigration
system
got
to
give
our
children
the
best
education
possible
and
we
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
protect
them
from
the
horrors
of
gun
violence
and
let
me
say
grateful
to
vice
president
for
his
work
on
this
issue
of
gun
violence
and
for
his
proposals
which
going
to
be
reviewing
today
and
will
address
in
the
next
few
days
and
intend
to
vigorously
pursue
so
with
that
going
to
take
some
questions
and
going
to
start
with
pace
of
and
want
to
congratulate
for
this
new
important
job
thank
you
very
much
the
president
yes
wanted
to
ask
about
gun
violence
today
marks
the
or
anniversary
of
the
shooting
in
which
seemed
to
generate
some
momentum
for
reinstating
the
assault
weapons
ban
but
been
fresh
opposition
to
that
ban
from
the
and
even
harry
has
said
that
he
questions
whether
it
could
pass
congress
given
that
how
hard
will
you
push
for
an
assault
weapons
ban
and
if
one
can
not
pass
congress
what
other
measures
would
need
to
be
included
in
broad
package
in
order
to
curb
gun
violence
successfully
the
president
well
as
said
the
vice
president
and
number
of
members
of
my
cabinet
went
through
very
thorough
process
over
the
last
month
meeting
with
lot
of
stakeholders
in
this
including
the
listened
to
proposals
from
all
quarters
and
presented
me
now
with
list
of
sensible
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
make
sure
that
the
kinds
of
violence
we
saw
at
does
happen
again
going
to
be
meeting
with
the
vice
president
today
expect
to
have
fuller
presentation
later
in
the
week
to
give
people
some
specifics
about
what
think
we
need
to
do
my
starting
point
is
not
to
worry
about
the
politics
my
starting
point
is
to
focus
on
what
makes
sense
what
works
what
should
we
be
doing
to
make
sure
that
our
children
are
safe
and
that
reducing
the
incidents
of
gun
violence
and
think
we
can
do
that
in
sensible
way
that
with
the
second
amendment
and
then
members
of
congress
think
are
going
to
have
to
have
debate
and
examine
their
own
conscience
because
if
in
fact
and
believe
this
is
true
everybody
across
party
lines
was
as
deeply
moved
and
saddened
as
was
by
what
happened
in
then
going
to
have
to
vote
based
on
what
we
think
is
best
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
answers
that
set
politics
aside
and
that
what
expect
congress
to
do
but
what
you
can
count
is
is
that
the
things
that
said
in
the
past
the
belief
that
we
have
to
have
stronger
background
checks
that
we
can
do
much
better
job
in
terms
of
keeping
these
magazine
clips
with
high
capacity
out
of
the
hands
of
folks
who
have
them
an
assault
weapons
ban
that
is
meaningful
that
those
are
things
continue
to
believe
make
sense
will
all
of
them
get
through
this
congress
know
but
uppermost
in
my
mind
is
making
sure
that
honest
with
the
american
people
and
with
members
of
congress
about
what
think
will
work
what
think
is
something
that
will
make
difference
and
to
repeat
what
said
earlier
if
there
is
step
we
can
take
that
will
save
even
one
child
from
what
happened
in
we
should
take
that
step
can
package
be
discussed
to
allow
an
assault
weapons
ban
the
president
present
the
details
later
in
the
week
chuck
thank
you
sir
as
you
know
the
senate
democrats
harry
sent
you
letter
begging
you
essentially
to
take
consider
some
sort
of
executive
action
on
this
debt
ceiling
issue
know
said
not
negotiating
on
it
your
administration
has
ruled
out
the
various
ideas
that
have
been
out
there
the
amendment
but
just
this
morning
one
of
the
house
democratic
leaders
asked
you
to
use
the
amendment
and
even
said
sometimes
what
it
takes
he
brought
up
the
emancipation
proclamation
as
saying
it
took
executive
action
when
congress
act
and
he
compared
the
debt
ceiling
to
that
so
are
you
considering
plan
and
if
not
why
not
the
president
well
chuck
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
america
pays
its
bills
we
are
not
deadbeat
nation
and
so
very
simple
solution
to
this
congress
us
to
pay
our
bills
now
if
the
house
and
the
senate
want
to
give
me
the
authority
so
that
they
have
to
take
these
tough
votes
if
they
want
to
put
the
responsibility
on
me
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling
happy
to
take
it
the
republican
leader
in
the
senate
had
proposal
like
that
last
year
and
happy
to
accept
it
but
if
they
want
to
keep
this
responsibility
then
they
need
to
go
ahead
and
get
it
done
and
there
are
no
magic
tricks
here
there
are
no
loopholes
there
are
no
easy
outs
this
is
matter
of
congress
spending
they
order
me
to
spend
they
tell
me
you
need
to
fund
our
department
at
such
and
such
level
you
need
to
send
out
social
security
checks
you
need
to
make
sure
that
you
are
paying
to
care
for
our
veterans
they
lay
all
this
out
for
me
because
they
have
the
spending
power
and
so
am
required
by
law
to
go
ahead
and
pay
these
bills
separately
they
also
have
to
the
raising
of
the
debt
ceiling
in
order
to
make
sure
that
those
bills
are
paid
and
so
what
congress
do
is
tell
me
to
spend
and
then
say
but
we
not
going
to
give
you
the
authority
to
go
ahead
and
pay
the
bills
and
just
want
to
repeat
because
think
sometimes
the
american
people
understandably
are
following
all
the
debates
here
in
washington
raising
the
debt
ceiling
does
not
us
to
spend
more
all
it
does
is
say
that
america
will
pay
its
bills
and
we
are
not
nation
and
the
consequences
of
us
not
paying
our
bills
as
outlined
in
my
opening
statement
would
be
disastrous
so
understand
the
impulse
to
try
to
get
around
this
in
simple
way
but
there
one
way
to
get
around
this
there
one
way
to
deal
with
it
and
that
is
for
congress
to
me
to
pay
for
those
items
of
spending
that
they
have
already
and
the
notion
that
republicans
in
the
house
or
maybe
some
republicans
in
the
senate
would
suggest
that
order
for
us
to
get
our
way
on
our
spending
priorities
that
we
would
risk
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
that
think
is
not
what
the
founders
intended
that
not
how
think
most
americans
think
our
democracy
should
work
they
got
point
of
view
democrats
in
congress
have
point
of
view
they
need
to
sit
down
and
work
out
compromise
you
just
outlined
an
entire
rationale
for
why
this
happen
the
president
yes
and
if
then
if
and
you
not
negotiating
on
the
debt
ceiling
the
president
yes
so
you
not
negotiating
and
they
say
you
have
to
negotiate
and
you
not
considering
another
plan
then
do
you
just
wait
it
out
and
we
do
go
we
do
see
all
these
things
happen
the
president
well
look
chuck
there
are
there
pretty
straightforward
way
of
doing
this
and
that
is
to
set
the
debt
ceiling
aside
we
pay
our
bills
and
then
we
have
vigorous
debate
about
how
we
going
to
do
further
deficit
reduction
in
balanced
way
keep
in
mind
that
what
we
heard
from
some
republicans
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
is
that
they
will
only
increase
the
debt
ceiling
by
the
amount
of
spending
cuts
that
they
able
to
push
through
and
in
order
to
replace
the
automatic
spending
cuts
of
the
that
trillion
say
it
takes
another
trillion
or
to
get
us
through
one
more
year
they
have
to
identify
trillion
in
cuts
just
to
get
the
debt
ceiling
extended
to
next
year
trillion
they
even
congress
has
not
been
able
to
identify
trillion
in
cuts
that
they
happy
with
because
these
same
republicans
say
they
want
to
cut
they
claimed
that
they
do
want
to
gut
or
harm
the
vulnerable
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
you
meet
their
own
criteria
without
drastically
cutting
or
having
an
impact
on
or
affecting
our
spending
so
the
math
just
add
up
now
what
would
work
what
would
work
would
be
for
us
to
say
already
done
close
to
trillion
in
deficit
reduction
and
if
you
add
the
interest
that
we
be
paying
because
of
less
spending
and
increased
revenue
it
adds
up
to
about
trillion
the
consensus
is
we
need
about
trillion
to
our
debt
and
our
deficit
which
means
we
need
about
trillion
more
the
package
that
offered
to
speaker
before
we
before
the
new
year
would
achieve
that
we
were
actually
fairly
close
in
terms
of
arriving
at
that
number
so
if
the
goal
is
to
make
sure
that
we
are
being
responsible
about
our
debt
and
our
deficit
if
the
conversation
having
happy
to
have
that
conversation
and
by
closing
some
additional
loopholes
through
tax
reform
which
speaker
has
acknowledged
can
raise
money
in
sensible
way
and
by
doing
some
additional
cuts
including
making
sure
that
we
are
reducing
our
health
care
spending
which
is
the
main
driver
of
our
deficits
we
can
arrive
at
package
that
gets
this
thing
done
happy
to
have
that
conversation
what
will
not
do
is
to
have
that
negotiation
with
gun
at
the
head
of
the
american
people
the
threat
that
we
get
our
way
unless
you
gut
or
or
otherwise
slash
things
that
the
american
people
believe
should
be
slashed
that
going
to
threaten
to
wreck
the
entire
that
is
not
how
historically
this
has
been
done
not
how
going
to
do
it
this
time
no
plan
you
not
searching
for
any
other
the
president
chuck
what
saying
to
you
is
that
there
is
no
simpler
solution
no
ready
credible
solution
other
than
congress
either
give
me
the
authority
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling
or
exercise
the
responsibility
that
they
have
kept
for
themselves
and
raise
the
debt
ceiling
because
this
is
about
paying
your
bills
everybody
here
understands
this
mean
this
is
not
complicated
concept
you
go
out
to
dinner
and
then
eat
all
you
want
and
then
leave
without
paying
the
check
and
if
you
do
breaking
the
law
and
congress
should
think
about
it
the
same
way
that
the
american
people
do
you
now
if
congress
wants
to
have
debate
about
maybe
we
go
out
to
dinner
next
time
maybe
we
should
go
to
more
modest
restaurant
fine
debate
that
we
should
have
but
you
say
in
order
for
me
to
control
my
appetites
going
to
not
pay
the
people
who
already
provided
me
services
people
who
already
lent
me
the
money
not
showing
any
discipline
all
doing
is
not
meeting
your
obligations
you
do
that
and
not
credible
way
to
run
this
government
got
to
stop
lurching
from
crisis
to
crisis
to
crisis
when
this
clear
path
ahead
of
us
that
simply
requires
some
discipline
some
responsibility
and
some
compromise
where
we
need
to
go
how
this
needs
to
work
major
thank
you
president
as
you
well
know
sir
finding
votes
for
the
debt
ceiling
can
sometimes
be
complicated
you
yourself
as
member
of
the
senate
voted
against
debt
ceiling
increase
and
in
previous
aspects
of
american
history
president
in
president
george
walker
bush
in
president
in
all
signed
deficit
reduction
deals
that
were
contingent
upon
or
in
the
context
of
raising
the
debt
ceiling
you
yourself
four
times
have
done
that
three
times
those
were
related
to
deficit
reduction
or
budget
what
chuck
and
and
think
many
people
are
curious
about
is
this
new
adamant
desire
on
your
part
not
to
negotiate
when
that
seems
to
conflict
with
the
entire
history
in
the
modern
era
of
american
presidents
and
the
debt
ceiling
and
your
own
history
on
the
debt
ceiling
and
that
suggest
that
we
are
going
to
go
into
default
situation
because
no
one
is
talking
to
each
other
about
how
to
resolve
this
the
president
well
no
major
think
if
you
look
at
the
history
getting
votes
for
the
debt
ceiling
is
always
difficult
and
budgets
in
this
town
are
always
difficult
went
through
this
just
last
year
but
different
is
we
never
saw
situation
as
we
saw
last
year
in
which
certain
groups
in
congress
took
such
an
absolutist
position
that
we
came
within
few
days
of
defaulting
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
is
that
we
have
never
seen
the
debt
ceiling
used
in
this
fashion
where
the
notion
was
you
know
what
we
might
default
unless
we
get
percent
of
what
we
want
that
happened
now
as
indicated
before
happy
to
have
conversation
about
how
we
reduce
our
deficits
further
in
sensible
way
although
one
thing
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
american
people
are
also
concerned
about
how
we
grow
our
economy
how
we
put
people
back
to
work
how
we
make
sure
that
we
finance
our
workers
getting
properly
trained
and
our
schools
are
giving
our
kids
the
education
we
deserve
whole
growth
agenda
which
will
reduce
our
deficits
important
as
well
but
what
never
seen
is
the
notion
that
has
been
presented
so
far
at
least
by
the
republicans
that
deficit
reduction
only
count
spending
cuts
that
we
will
raise
the
deficit
or
the
debt
ceiling
dollar
for
dollar
on
spending
cuts
there
are
whole
set
of
rules
that
have
been
established
that
are
impossible
to
meet
without
doing
severe
damage
to
the
economy
and
so
what
not
going
to
do
is
put
ourselves
in
position
where
in
order
to
pay
for
spending
that
already
incurred
that
our
two
options
are
either
going
to
profoundly
hurt
the
economy
and
hurt
families
and
hurt
seniors
and
hurt
kids
who
are
trying
to
go
to
college
or
alternatively
going
to
blow
up
the
economy
not
going
to
do
that
inaudible
open
to
extension
to
the
debt
ceiling
whatever
congress
sends
you
okay
with
it
the
president
no
not
whatever
congress
sends
me
going
to
have
to
send
me
something
sensible
and
we
be
doing
this
inaudible
the
president
and
we
be
doing
this
on
one
to
timeframe
why
would
we
do
that
this
is
the
united
states
of
america
major
what
we
manage
our
affairs
in
such
way
that
we
pay
our
bills
and
we
provide
some
certainty
in
terms
of
how
we
pay
our
bills
look
think
anybody
would
consider
my
position
unreasonable
here
have
but
why
does
it
presuppose
the
need
to
negotiate
and
talk
about
this
on
daily
basis
because
if
default
is
the
biggest
threat
to
the
economy
why
not
talk
about
it
the
president
major
am
happy
to
have
conversation
about
how
we
reduce
our
deficits
not
going
to
have
monthly
or
conversation
about
whether
or
not
we
pay
our
bills
because
that
in
and
of
itself
does
severe
damage
even
the
threat
of
default
hurts
our
economy
hurting
our
economy
as
we
speak
we
be
having
that
debate
if
we
want
to
have
conversation
about
how
to
reduce
our
deficit
have
that
been
having
that
for
the
last
two
years
we
just
had
an
entire
campaign
about
it
and
by
the
way
the
american
people
agreed
with
me
that
we
should
reduce
our
deficits
in
balanced
way
that
also
takes
into
account
the
need
for
us
to
grow
this
economy
and
put
people
back
to
work
and
despite
that
conversation
and
despite
the
election
results
the
position
been
taken
on
the
part
of
some
house
republicans
is
that
got
to
do
it
our
way
and
if
we
we
simply
pay
well
that
be
position
that
is
sustainable
over
time
not
one
that
good
for
the
economy
now
it
certainly
not
going
to
be
the
kind
of
precedent
that
want
to
establish
not
just
for
my
presidency
but
for
future
presidents
even
if
it
was
on
the
other
side
democrats
do
like
voting
for
the
debt
ceiling
when
republican
is
president
and
yet
you
but
you
never
saw
situation
in
which
democrats
suggested
somehow
that
we
would
go
ahead
and
default
if
we
did
get
percent
of
our
way
that
just
not
how
it
supposed
to
work
thank
you
president
on
the
issue
of
guns
given
how
difficult
it
will
be
some
would
say
impossible
to
get
any
gun
control
measure
passed
through
this
congress
what
are
you
willing
or
able
to
do
using
the
powers
of
your
presidency
to
act
without
congress
and
also
like
to
know
what
do
you
make
of
these
long
lines
we
seeing
at
gun
shows
and
gun
stores
all
around
the
country
mean
even
in
applications
for
guns
are
up
since
the
shooting
in
the
president
well
my
understanding
is
the
vice
president
is
going
to
provide
range
of
steps
that
we
can
take
to
reduce
gun
violence
some
of
them
will
require
legislation
some
of
them
can
accomplish
through
executive
action
and
so
be
reviewing
those
today
and
as
said
speak
in
more
detail
to
what
we
going
to
go
ahead
and
propose
later
in
the
week
but
confident
that
there
are
some
steps
that
we
can
take
that
do
require
legislation
and
that
are
within
my
authority
as
president
and
where
you
get
step
that
has
the
opportunity
to
reduce
the
possibility
of
gun
violence
then
want
to
go
ahead
and
take
it
any
idea
of
what
kind
of
steps
the
president
well
think
for
example
how
we
are
gathering
data
for
example
on
guns
that
fall
into
the
hands
of
criminals
and
how
we
track
that
more
effectively
there
may
be
some
steps
that
we
can
take
administratively
as
opposed
through
legislation
as
far
as
people
lining
up
and
purchasing
more
guns
think
that
we
seen
for
some
time
now
that
those
who
oppose
any
gun
control
or
gun
safety
measures
have
pretty
effective
way
of
up
fear
on
the
part
of
gun
owners
that
somehow
the
federal
government
is
about
to
take
all
your
guns
away
and
there
probably
an
economic
element
to
that
it
obviously
is
good
for
business
but
think
that
those
of
us
who
look
at
this
problem
have
repeatedly
said
that
responsible
gun
owners
people
who
have
gun
for
protection
for
hunting
for
sportsmanship
they
do
have
anything
to
worry
about
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
we
believe
in
the
second
amendment
the
issue
is
are
there
some
sensible
steps
that
we
can
take
to
make
sure
that
somebody
like
the
individual
in
walk
into
school
and
gun
down
bunch
of
children
in
shockingly
rapid
fashion
and
surely
we
can
do
something
about
that
but
part
of
the
challenge
that
we
confront
is
is
that
even
the
slightest
hint
of
some
sensible
responsible
legislation
in
this
area
fans
this
notion
that
somehow
here
it
comes
and
everybody
guns
are
going
to
be
taken
away
it
unfortunate
but
that
the
case
and
if
you
look
at
over
the
first
four
years
of
my
administration
tried
to
tighten
up
and
enforce
some
of
the
laws
that
were
already
on
the
books
but
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
argue
that
somehow
gun
owners
have
had
their
rights
infringed
so
you
think
this
is
an
irrational
fear
that
driving
all
these
people
to
go
and
stock
up
the
president
excuse
me
do
you
think
this
is
an
irrational
fear
the
president
well
as
said
think
it
fear
that
fanned
by
those
who
are
worried
about
the
possibility
of
any
legislation
getting
out
there
thank
you
president
just
want
to
come
back
to
the
debt
ceiling
because
in
the
summer
of
you
said
that
you
would
negotiate
on
the
debt
ceiling
and
you
did
last
year
you
said
that
you
would
extend
any
of
the
bush
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
and
you
did
so
as
you
say
now
that
you
not
going
to
negotiate
on
the
debt
ceiling
this
year
why
should
house
republicans
take
that
seriously
and
think
that
if
we
get
to
the
scenario
that
you
not
going
to
back
down
the
president
well
first
of
all
let
take
the
example
of
this
year
and
the
fiscal
cliff
did
say
that
would
not
have
any
conversations
at
all
about
extending
the
bush
tax
cuts
what
said
was
we
were
going
to
extend
bush
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy
and
we
did
now
you
can
argue
that
during
the
campaign
said
set
the
criteria
for
wealthy
at
and
we
ended
up
being
at
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
millionaires
billionaires
are
paying
significantly
more
in
taxes
just
as
said
so
from
the
start
my
concern
was
making
sure
that
we
had
tax
code
that
was
fair
and
that
protected
the
middle
class
and
my
biggest
priority
was
making
sure
that
taxes
did
not
go
up
the
difference
between
this
year
and
is
the
fact
that
we
already
made
trillion
in
cuts
and
at
the
time
indicated
that
there
were
cuts
that
we
could
sensibly
make
that
would
not
damage
our
economy
would
not
impede
growth
said
at
the
time
think
we
should
pair
it
up
with
revenue
in
order
to
have
an
overall
balanced
package
but
my
own
budget
reflected
cuts
in
discretionary
spending
my
own
budget
reflected
the
cuts
that
needed
to
be
made
and
we
made
those
cuts
now
the
challenge
going
forward
is
that
we
now
made
some
big
cuts
and
if
we
going
to
do
further
deficit
reduction
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
in
balanced
and
responsible
way
the
alternative
is
for
us
to
go
ahead
and
cut
commitments
that
we
made
on
things
like
or
social
security
or
and
for
us
to
fundamentally
change
commitments
that
we
made
to
make
sure
that
seniors
do
go
into
poverty
or
that
children
who
are
disabled
are
properly
cared
for
for
us
to
change
that
contract
we
made
with
the
american
people
rather
than
look
at
options
like
closing
loopholes
for
corporations
that
they
do
need
that
points
to
trend
in
which
we
have
fundamentally
think
undermined
what
people
expect
out
of
this
government
which
is
that
parties
sit
down
they
negotiate
they
compromise
but
they
also
reflect
the
will
of
the
american
people
that
you
do
have
one
narrow
faction
that
is
able
to
simply
dictate
percent
of
what
they
want
all
the
time
or
otherwise
threaten
that
we
destroy
the
american
economy
another
way
of
putting
it
is
we
got
to
break
the
habit
of
negotiating
through
crisis
over
and
over
again
and
now
is
as
good
of
time
as
any
at
the
start
of
my
second
term
because
if
we
continue
down
this
path
then
there
really
no
stopping
the
principle
mean
literally
even
in
divided
government
even
where
we
got
democratic
president
and
democratic
senate
that
small
group
in
the
house
of
representatives
could
simply
say
every
two
months
every
three
months
every
six
months
every
year
we
are
going
to
more
and
more
change
the
economy
in
ways
that
we
prefer
despite
strong
objections
of
americans
all
across
the
country
or
otherwise
we
going
to
have
america
not
pay
its
bills
and
that
is
no
way
for
us
to
do
business
and
by
the
way
would
make
the
same
argument
if
it
was
republican
president
and
republican
senate
and
you
had
handful
of
democrats
who
were
suggesting
that
we
are
going
to
hijack
the
process
and
make
sure
that
either
we
get
our
way
percent
of
the
time
or
otherwise
we
are
going
to
default
on
obligations
inaudible
line
in
the
sand
negotiating
how
is
that
inaudible
to
the
economy
the
president
no
no
look
what
said
is
that
happy
to
have
conversation
about
deficit
reduction
so
you
technically
are
willing
to
negotiate
the
president
no
look
this
is
pretty
straightforward
either
congress
pays
its
bills
or
it
does
now
if
and
they
want
to
keep
this
responsibility
if
john
and
think
that
they
can
come
up
with
plan
that
somehow
meets
their
criteria
that
set
for
why
they
will
when
they
will
raise
the
debt
ceiling
they
free
to
go
ahead
and
try
but
the
proposals
that
put
forward
in
order
to
accomplish
that
only
by
cutting
spending
means
cuts
to
things
like
and
education
that
the
american
people
profoundly
reject
now
if
they
think
that
they
can
get
that
through
congress
then
they
free
to
try
but
think
that
better
way
of
doing
this
is
go
ahead
and
say
going
to
pay
our
bills
the
question
now
is
how
do
we
actually
get
our
deficit
in
manageable
sustainable
way
and
that
conversation
happy
to
have
all
right
matt
thank
you
sir
spoken
extensively
about
the
debt
ceiling
debate
but
some
republicans
have
further
said
that
they
willing
to
allow
government
shutdown
to
take
place
rather
than
put
off
deep
spending
cuts
are
you
prepared
to
allow
the
government
to
grind
to
halt
if
you
disagree
with
the
spending
cut
proposals
they
put
forth
and
who
do
you
think
the
american
people
would
blame
if
that
came
to
pass
the
president
well
ultimately
congress
makes
the
decisions
about
whether
or
not
we
spend
money
and
whether
or
not
we
keep
this
government
open
and
if
the
republicans
in
congress
have
made
decision
that
they
want
to
shut
down
the
government
in
order
to
get
their
way
then
they
have
the
votes
at
least
in
the
house
of
representatives
probably
to
do
that
think
that
would
be
mistake
think
it
would
be
profoundly
damaging
to
our
economy
think
it
would
actually
add
to
our
deficit
because
it
will
impede
growth
think
shortsighted
but
elected
representatives
and
folks
put
them
into
those
positions
and
going
to
have
to
make
decision
about
that
and
suspect
that
the
american
people
would
blame
all
of
washington
for
not
being
able
to
get
its
act
together
but
the
larger
issue
here
has
to
do
with
what
is
it
that
trying
to
accomplish
are
we
trying
to
reduce
the
deficit
because
if
trying
to
reduce
the
deficit
then
we
can
shape
bipartisan
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
mean
is
that
really
our
objective
our
concern
is
that
spending
more
than
we
take
in
and
if
the
case
then
way
of
balancing
that
out
so
that
we
take
in
more
money
in
increasing
revenue
and
we
reduce
spending
and
recipe
for
getting
that
done
and
in
the
conversations
that
had
with
speaker
before
the
end
of
the
year
we
came
pretty
close
few
hundred
billion
dollars
separating
us
when
stretched
over
period
not
lot
but
it
seems
as
if
motivating
and
propelling
at
this
point
some
of
the
house
republicans
is
more
than
simply
deficit
reduction
they
have
particular
vision
about
what
government
should
and
should
not
do
so
they
are
suspicious
about
commitments
for
example
to
make
sure
that
seniors
have
decent
health
care
as
they
get
older
they
have
suspicions
about
social
security
they
have
suspicions
about
whether
government
should
make
sure
that
kids
in
poverty
are
getting
enough
to
eat
or
whether
we
should
be
spending
money
on
medical
research
so
got
particular
view
of
what
government
should
do
and
should
be
and
that
view
was
rejected
by
the
american
people
when
it
was
debated
during
the
presidential
campaign
think
every
poll
out
there
indicates
that
the
american
people
actually
think
our
commitment
to
or
to
education
is
really
important
and
something
that
we
should
look
at
as
last
resort
in
terms
of
reducing
the
deficit
and
it
makes
lot
more
sense
for
us
to
close
for
example
corporate
loopholes
before
we
go
to
putting
bigger
burden
on
students
or
seniors
but
if
the
house
republicans
disagree
with
that
and
they
want
to
shut
down
the
government
to
see
if
they
can
get
their
way
on
it
their
prerogative
how
the
system
is
set
up
it
will
damage
our
economy
the
government
is
big
part
of
this
economy
and
interesting
that
lot
of
times
you
have
people
who
that
when
it
comes
to
spending
some
of
the
same
folks
who
say
got
to
cut
spending
or
complain
that
government
jobs
do
anything
when
it
comes
to
that
contractor
in
their
district
they
think
wow
this
is
pretty
important
part
of
the
economy
in
my
district
and
we
stop
spending
on
that
just
make
sure
not
spending
on
those
other
folks
find
agreement
with
republicans
on
this
and
the
president
look
my
hope
is
is
that
common
sense
prevails
always
my
preference
and
think
that
would
the
preference
of
the
american
people
and
what
would
be
good
for
the
economy
so
let
me
just
repeat
if
the
issue
is
deficit
reduction
getting
our
deficits
sustainable
over
time
getting
our
debt
in
sustainable
place
then
democrats
and
republicans
in
congress
will
have
partner
with
me
we
can
achieve
that
and
we
can
achieve
it
fairly
quickly
mean
we
know
what
the
numbers
are
we
know
what
needs
to
be
done
we
know
what
balanced
approach
would
take
already
done
probably
more
than
half
of
the
deficit
reduction
we
need
to
the
debt
and
the
deficit
probably
been
more
pain
and
drama
in
getting
there
than
we
needed
and
so
finishing
the
job
be
that
difficult
if
everybody
comes
to
the
conversation
with
an
open
mind
and
if
we
that
there
are
some
things
like
not
paying
our
bills
that
should
be
out
of
bounds
all
right
going
to
take
one
last
question
thank
you
president
the
president
yes
like
to
ask
you
now
that
reached
the
end
of
your
first
term
starting
your
second
about
couple
of
criticisms
one
longstanding
another
more
recent
the
longstanding
one
seems
to
have
become
truism
of
sorts
that
you
and
your
staff
are
too
insular
that
you
enough
and
the
second
the
more
recent
criticism
is
that
your
team
taking
shape
diverse
as
diverse
as
it
could
be
or
even
was
in
terms
of
getting
additional
voices
gender
race
ethnic
diversity
so
like
you
to
address
both
of
those
the
president
sure
let
me
take
the
second
one
first
very
proud
that
in
the
first
four
years
we
had
as
diverse
if
not
more
diverse
white
house
and
cabinet
than
any
in
history
and
intend
to
continue
that
because
it
turns
out
that
when
you
look
for
the
very
best
people
given
the
incredible
diversity
of
this
country
going
to
end
up
with
diverse
staff
and
diverse
team
and
that
very
diversity
helps
to
create
more
effective
and
better
for
me
because
it
brings
different
perspectives
to
the
table
so
if
you
think
about
my
first
four
years
the
person
who
probably
had
the
most
influence
on
my
foreign
policy
was
woman
the
people
who
were
in
charge
of
moving
forward
my
most
important
domestic
initiative
health
care
were
women
the
person
in
charge
of
our
homeland
security
was
woman
my
two
appointments
to
the
supreme
court
were
women
and
percent
of
my
white
house
staff
were
women
so
think
people
should
expect
that
that
record
will
be
built
upon
during
the
next
four
years
now
what
made
four
appointments
so
far
and
one
women
admittedly
one
is
leaving
the
has
already
left
the
administration
and
have
made
replacement
but
would
just
suggest
that
everybody
kind
of
wait
until
seen
all
my
appointments
in
the
white
house
staff
and
in
my
cabinet
before
they
rush
to
judgment
inaudible
the
big
three
the
president
yes
but
guess
what
saying
is
that
think
until
seen
what
my
overall
team
looks
like
premature
to
assume
that
somehow
going
backwards
not
going
backwards
going
forward
with
respect
to
this
about
me
not
enough
and
patting
folks
on
the
back
and
all
that
stuff
most
people
who
know
me
know
pretty
friendly
guy
and
like
good
party
and
the
truth
is
that
when
was
in
the
senate
had
great
relationships
over
there
and
up
until
the
point
that
became
president
this
was
not
an
accusation
that
you
heard
very
frequently
think
that
really
gone
on
in
terms
of
some
of
the
paralysis
here
in
washington
or
difficulties
in
negotiations
just
have
to
do
with
some
very
stark
differences
in
terms
of
policy
some
very
sharp
differences
in
terms
of
where
we
stand
on
issues
and
if
you
think
about
let
say
myself
and
speaker
like
speaker
personally
and
when
we
went
out
and
played
golf
we
had
great
time
but
that
did
get
deal
done
in
when
over
here
at
the
congressional
picnic
and
folks
are
coming
up
and
taking
pictures
with
their
family
promise
you
and
are
very
nice
to
them
and
we
have
wonderful
time
but
it
does
prevent
them
from
going
onto
the
floor
of
the
house
and
blasting
me
for
being
socialist
and
the
reason
that
in
many
cases
congress
votes
the
way
they
do
or
talks
the
way
they
talk
or
takes
positions
in
negotiations
that
they
take
does
have
to
do
with
me
it
has
to
do
with
the
imperatives
that
they
feel
in
terms
of
their
own
politics
right
they
worried
about
their
district
they
worried
about
what
going
on
back
home
think
there
are
lot
of
republicans
at
this
point
that
feel
that
given
how
much
energy
has
been
devoted
in
some
of
the
media
that
preferred
by
republican
constituencies
to
me
that
it
does
look
real
good
with
me
charlie
down
in
florida
think
testifies
to
that
and
think
lot
of
folks
say
well
if
we
look
like
we
being
too
cooperative
or
too
with
the
president
that
might
cause
us
problems
that
might
be
an
excuse
for
us
to
get
challenge
from
somebody
in
primary
so
that
tends
to
be
the
challenge
promise
you
we
invite
folks
from
congress
over
here
all
the
time
and
when
they
choose
to
come
enjoy
their
company
sometimes
they
do
choose
to
come
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
think
they
do
consider
the
optics
useful
for
them
politically
and
ultimately
the
way
we
going
to
get
stuff
done
personal
relationships
are
important
and
obviously
can
always
do
better
job
and
the
nice
thing
is
is
that
now
that
my
girls
are
getting
older
they
do
want
to
spend
that
much
time
with
me
anyway
so
be
probably
calling
around
looking
for
somebody
to
play
cards
with
me
or
something
because
getting
kind
of
lonely
in
this
big
house
so
maybe
whole
bunch
of
members
of
the
house
republican
caucus
want
to
come
over
and
more
but
my
suspicion
is
getting
the
issues
resolved
that
we
just
talked
about
the
big
stuff
whether
or
not
we
get
sensible
laws
passed
to
prevent
gun
violence
whether
or
not
america
is
paying
its
bills
whether
or
not
we
get
immigration
reform
done
all
that
going
to
be
determined
largely
by
where
the
respective
parties
stand
on
policy
and
maybe
most
importantly
the
attitude
of
the
american
people
if
the
american
people
feel
strongly
about
these
issues
and
they
push
hard
and
they
reward
or
do
reward
members
of
congress
with
their
votes
if
they
reject
sort
of
uncompromising
positions
or
sharp
partisanship
or
always
looking
out
for
the
next
election
and
they
reward
folks
who
are
trying
to
find
common
ground
then
think
you
see
in
congress
change
and
that
will
be
true
whether
the
life
of
the
party
or
stick
in
the
mud
thank
you
very
much
everybody
to
ken
friends
and
former
colleagues
it
is
an
extraordinary
to
be
here
with
you
in
this
magnificent
place
to
pay
tribute
to
man
who
would
probably
we
wondering
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
this
tuesday
was
in
many
ways
day
like
any
other
the
sun
rose
the
sun
set
the
great
work
of
our
democracy
carried
on
but
in
fundamental
sense
it
was
different
it
was
the
first
day
in
many
of
our
lives
certainly
my
own
that
the
halls
of
the
united
states
congress
were
not
graced
by
the
presence
of
daniel
ken
was
elected
to
the
senate
when
was
two
years
old
he
had
been
elected
to
congress
couple
of
years
before
was
born
he
would
remain
my
senator
until
left
hawaii
for
college
now
even
though
my
mother
and
grandparents
took
great
pride
that
they
had
voted
for
him
confess
that
was
paying
much
attention
to
the
united
states
senate
at
the
age
of
four
or
five
or
six
it
was
until
was
years
old
that
recall
even
learning
what
senator
was
or
it
registering
at
least
it
was
during
my
summer
vacation
with
my
family
my
first
trip
to
what
those
of
us
in
hawaii
call
the
mainland
so
we
flew
over
the
ocean
and
with
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
and
my
sister
who
at
the
time
was
two
we
around
the
country
it
was
big
trip
we
went
to
seattle
and
we
went
to
which
was
most
important
we
to
where
my
grandmother
family
was
from
and
went
to
chicago
and
went
to
and
we
took
greyhound
buses
most
of
the
time
and
we
rented
cars
and
we
would
stay
at
local
motels
or
and
if
there
was
pool
at
one
of
these
motels
even
if
it
was
just
tiny
would
be
very
excited
and
the
ice
machine
was
exciting
and
the
vending
machine
was
really
excited
about
that
but
this
is
at
time
when
you
have
stations
and
hours
worth
of
cartoons
and
so
at
night
if
the
was
on
it
was
what
your
parents
decided
to
watch
and
my
mother
that
summer
would
turn
on
the
every
night
during
this
vacation
and
watch
the
hearings
and
say
that
understood
everything
that
was
being
discussed
but
knew
the
issues
were
important
knew
they
spoke
to
some
basic
way
about
who
we
were
and
who
we
might
be
as
americans
and
so
slowly
during
the
course
of
this
trip
which
lasted
about
month
some
of
this
seeped
into
my
head
and
the
person
who
fascinated
me
most
was
this
man
of
descent
with
one
arm
speaking
in
this
courtly
baritone
full
of
dignity
and
grace
and
maybe
he
captivated
my
attention
because
my
mom
explained
that
this
was
our
senator
and
that
he
was
upholding
what
our
government
was
all
about
maybe
it
was
boyhood
fascination
with
the
story
of
how
he
had
lost
his
arm
in
war
but
think
it
was
more
than
that
now
here
was
young
boy
with
white
mom
black
father
raised
in
and
hawaii
and
was
beginning
to
sense
how
fitting
into
the
world
might
not
be
as
simple
as
it
might
seem
and
so
to
see
this
man
this
senator
this
powerful
accomplished
person
who
was
out
of
central
casting
when
it
came
to
what
you
think
senator
might
look
like
at
the
time
and
the
way
he
commanded
the
respect
of
an
entire
nation
think
it
hinted
to
me
what
might
be
possible
in
my
own
life
this
was
man
who
as
teenager
stepped
up
to
serve
his
country
even
after
his
fellow
americans
were
declared
enemy
aliens
man
who
believed
in
america
even
when
its
government
did
necessarily
believe
in
him
that
meant
something
to
me
it
gave
me
powerful
sense
one
that
put
into
words
powerful
sense
of
hope
and
as
watched
those
hearings
listening
to
ask
all
those
piercing
questions
night
after
night
learned
something
else
learned
how
our
democracy
was
supposed
to
work
our
government
of
and
by
and
for
the
people
that
we
had
system
of
government
where
nobody
is
above
the
law
where
we
have
an
obligation
to
hold
each
other
accountable
from
the
average
citizen
to
the
most
powerful
of
leaders
because
these
things
that
we
stand
for
these
ideals
that
we
hold
dear
are
bigger
than
any
one
person
or
party
or
politician
and
somehow
nobody
communicated
that
more
effectively
than
you
got
sense
as
mentioned
of
just
fundamental
integrity
that
he
was
proud
democrat
but
most
importantly
he
was
proud
american
and
were
it
not
for
those
two
insights
planted
in
my
head
at
the
age
of
in
between
and
trip
to
might
never
have
considered
career
in
public
service
might
not
be
standing
here
today
think
it
fair
to
say
that
was
perhaps
my
earliest
political
inspiration
and
then
for
me
to
have
the
privilege
of
serving
with
him
to
be
elected
to
the
united
states
senate
and
arrive
and
one
of
my
first
visits
is
to
go
to
his
office
and
for
him
to
greet
me
as
colleague
and
treat
me
with
the
same
respect
that
he
treated
everybody
he
met
and
to
sit
me
down
and
give
me
advice
about
how
the
senate
worked
and
then
regale
me
with
some
stories
about
wartime
and
his
recovery
stories
full
of
never
bitterness
never
boastfulness
just
some
of
them
must
admit
little
probably
repeat
them
in
the
cathedral
laughter
side
of
that
well
once
told
his
son
his
service
to
this
country
had
been
for
the
children
or
all
the
sons
and
daughters
who
deserved
to
grow
up
in
nation
that
never
questioned
their
patriotism
this
is
my
country
he
said
many
of
us
have
fought
hard
for
the
right
to
say
that
and
obviously
rick
described
what
it
meant
for
americans
but
my
point
is
is
that
when
he
referred
to
our
sons
and
daughters
he
just
talking
about
americans
he
was
talking
about
all
of
us
he
was
talking
about
those
who
serve
today
who
might
have
been
excluded
in
the
past
talking
about
me
and
who
was
for
him
freedom
and
dignity
were
not
abstractions
they
were
values
that
he
had
bled
for
ideas
he
had
sacrificed
for
rights
he
understood
as
only
someone
can
who
has
had
them
threatened
had
them
taken
away
the
that
earned
him
our
highest
military
decoration
story
so
incredible
that
when
you
actually
read
the
accounts
you
think
this
you
make
this
up
like
out
of
an
action
movie
that
was
so
rooted
in
deep
and
abiding
love
of
this
country
and
he
believed
as
we
say
in
hawaii
that
single
that
we
one
family
and
he
devoted
his
life
to
making
that
family
strong
after
experiencing
the
horror
of
war
himself
also
felt
profound
connection
to
those
who
followed
it
unusual
for
him
to
take
time
out
of
his
busy
schedule
to
sit
down
with
veteran
or
fellow
amputee
trading
stories
telling
jokes
two
generations
apart
sharing
an
unspoken
bond
that
was
forged
in
battle
and
tempered
in
peace
in
no
small
measure
because
of
service
our
military
is
and
will
always
remain
the
best
in
the
world
and
we
our
sacred
obligation
to
give
our
veterans
the
care
they
deserve
of
course
always
take
credit
for
the
difference
he
made
ever
humble
one
of
the
only
landmarks
that
bear
his
name
is
marine
corps
mess
hall
in
hawaii
and
when
someone
asked
him
how
he
wanted
to
be
remembered
said
represented
the
people
of
hawaii
and
this
nation
honestly
and
to
the
best
of
my
ability
think
did
you
were
more
than
okay
you
were
extraordinary
been
mentioned
that
ended
his
convention
in
chicago
in
with
the
word
some
of
you
who
visited
us
it
may
have
meant
hello
he
said
but
others
it
may
have
meant
goodbye
those
of
us
been
privileged
to
live
in
hawaii
understand
aloha
means
love
and
as
someone
who
has
been
privileged
to
live
in
hawaii
know
that
he
embodied
the
very
best
of
that
spirit
the
very
best
of
fitting
it
was
the
last
word
that
spoke
on
this
earth
he
may
have
been
saying
goodbye
to
us
maybe
he
was
saying
hello
to
someone
waiting
on
the
other
side
but
it
was
final
expression
most
of
all
of
his
love
for
the
family
and
friends
that
he
cared
so
much
about
for
the
men
and
women
he
was
to
serve
with
for
the
country
that
held
such
special
place
in
his
heart
and
so
we
remember
man
who
inspired
all
of
us
with
his
courage
and
moved
us
with
his
compassion
that
inspired
us
with
his
integrity
and
who
taught
so
many
of
us
including
young
kid
growing
up
in
hawaii
that
america
has
place
for
everyone
may
god
bless
daniel
and
may
god
grant
us
more
souls
like
his
good
morning
everybody
now
been
five
days
since
the
heartbreaking
tragedy
in
three
days
since
we
gathered
as
nation
to
pray
for
the
victims
and
today
few
more
of
the
small
children
and
six
educators
who
were
taken
from
us
will
be
laid
to
rest
we
may
never
know
all
the
reasons
why
this
tragedy
happened
we
do
know
that
every
day
since
more
americans
have
died
of
gun
violence
we
know
such
violence
has
terrible
consequences
for
our
society
and
if
there
is
even
one
thing
that
we
can
do
to
prevent
any
of
these
events
we
have
deep
obligation
all
of
us
to
try
over
these
past
five
days
discussion
has
as
to
what
we
might
do
not
only
to
deter
mass
shootings
in
the
future
but
to
reduce
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
that
plagues
this
country
every
single
day
and
encouraging
that
people
of
all
different
backgrounds
and
beliefs
and
political
persuasions
have
been
willing
to
challenge
some
old
assumptions
and
change
longstanding
positions
that
conversation
has
to
continue
but
this
time
the
words
need
to
lead
to
action
we
know
this
is
complex
issue
that
stirs
deeply
held
passions
and
political
divides
and
as
said
on
sunday
night
no
law
or
set
of
laws
that
can
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
in
our
society
going
to
need
to
work
on
making
access
to
mental
health
care
at
least
as
easy
as
access
to
gun
going
to
need
to
look
more
closely
at
culture
that
all
too
often
glorifies
guns
and
violence
and
any
actions
we
must
take
must
begin
inside
the
home
and
inside
our
hearts
but
the
fact
that
this
problem
is
complex
can
no
longer
be
an
excuse
for
doing
nothing
the
fact
that
we
prevent
every
act
of
violence
mean
we
steadily
reduce
the
violence
and
prevent
the
very
worst
violence
why
asked
the
vice
president
to
lead
an
effort
that
includes
members
of
my
cabinet
and
outside
to
come
up
with
set
of
concrete
proposals
no
later
than
january
proposals
that
then
intend
to
push
without
delay
this
is
not
some
washington
commission
this
is
not
something
where
folks
are
going
to
be
studying
the
issue
for
six
months
and
publishing
report
that
gets
read
and
then
pushed
aside
this
is
team
that
has
very
specific
task
to
pull
together
real
reforms
right
now
asked
to
lead
this
effort
in
part
because
he
wrote
the
crime
bill
that
helped
law
enforcement
bring
down
the
rate
of
violent
crime
in
this
country
that
plan
that
bill
also
included
the
assault
weapons
ban
that
was
publicly
supported
at
the
time
by
former
presidents
including
the
good
news
is
already
growing
consensus
for
us
to
build
from
majority
of
americans
support
banning
the
sale
of
assault
weapons
majority
of
americans
support
banning
the
sale
of
ammunition
clips
majority
of
americans
support
laws
requiring
background
checks
before
all
gun
purchases
so
that
criminals
take
advantage
of
legal
loopholes
to
buy
gun
from
somebody
who
take
the
responsibility
of
doing
background
check
at
all
urge
the
new
congress
to
hold
votes
on
these
measures
next
year
in
timely
manner
and
considering
congress
confirmed
director
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
in
six
years
the
agency
that
works
most
closely
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
keep
illegal
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
suggest
that
they
make
this
priority
early
in
the
year
look
like
the
majority
of
americans
believe
that
the
second
amendment
guarantees
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms
this
country
has
strong
tradition
of
gun
ownership
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
obviously
across
the
country
there
are
regional
differences
there
are
differences
between
how
people
feel
in
urban
areas
and
rural
areas
and
the
fact
is
the
vast
majority
of
gun
owners
in
america
are
responsible
they
buy
their
guns
legally
and
they
use
them
safely
whether
for
hunting
or
sport
shooting
collection
or
protection
but
you
know
what
am
also
betting
that
the
majority
the
vast
majority
of
responsible
gun
owners
would
be
some
of
the
first
to
say
that
we
should
be
able
to
keep
an
irresponsible
few
from
buying
weapon
of
war
willing
to
bet
that
they
think
that
using
gun
and
using
common
sense
are
incompatible
ideas
that
an
unbalanced
man
be
able
to
get
his
hands
on
assault
rifle
so
easily
that
in
this
age
of
technology
we
should
be
able
to
check
criminal
records
before
he
or
she
can
check
out
at
gun
show
that
if
we
work
harder
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
there
would
be
fewer
atrocities
like
the
one
in
or
any
of
the
tragedies
that
visit
small
towns
and
big
cities
all
across
america
every
day
since
friday
morning
police
officer
was
gunned
down
in
memphis
leaving
four
children
without
their
mother
two
officers
were
killed
outside
grocery
store
in
woman
was
shot
and
killed
inside
las
casino
three
people
were
shot
inside
an
alabama
hospital
was
caught
in
in
missouri
and
taken
off
life
support
just
yesterday
each
one
of
these
americans
was
victim
of
the
everyday
gun
violence
that
takes
the
lives
of
more
than
americans
every
year
violence
that
we
can
not
accept
as
routine
so
will
use
all
the
powers
of
this
office
to
help
advance
efforts
aimed
at
preventing
more
tragedies
like
this
we
prevent
them
all
but
that
be
an
excuse
not
to
try
it
be
easy
but
that
be
an
excuse
not
to
try
and
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
by
myself
ultimately
if
this
effort
is
to
succeed
going
to
require
the
help
of
the
american
people
going
to
require
all
of
you
if
we
going
to
change
things
going
to
take
wave
of
americans
mothers
and
fathers
daughters
and
sons
pastors
law
enforcement
mental
health
professionals
and
yes
gun
owners
standing
up
and
saying
on
behalf
of
our
kids
it
will
take
commitment
and
compromise
and
most
of
all
it
will
take
courage
but
if
those
of
us
who
were
sent
here
to
serve
the
public
trust
can
summon
even
one
tiny
iota
of
the
courage
those
teachers
that
principal
in
summoned
on
friday
if
cooperation
and
common
sense
prevail
then
convinced
we
can
make
sensible
intelligent
way
to
make
the
united
states
of
america
safer
stronger
place
for
our
children
to
learn
and
to
grow
thank
you
and
now
going
to
let
the
vice
president
go
and
going
to
take
few
questions
and
will
start
with
ben
feller
thank
you
president
like
to
ask
you
about
the
other
serious
issue
consuming
this
town
right
now
the
fiscal
cliff
the
president
right
you
betrayed
some
of
the
voters
who
supported
you
in
the
election
by
changing
your
positions
on
who
should
get
tax
increase
and
by
including
social
security
benefits
now
in
this
mix
and
more
broadly
there
seems
to
be
deepening
sense
that
negotiations
are
going
very
well
right
now
can
you
give
us
candid
update
are
we
likely
to
go
over
the
cliff
the
president
well
first
of
all
there
no
reason
why
we
should
remember
what
said
during
the
campaign
thought
that
it
was
important
for
us
to
reduce
our
deficit
in
balanced
and
responsible
way
said
it
was
important
for
us
to
make
sure
that
millionaires
and
billionaires
paid
their
fair
share
said
that
we
were
going
to
have
to
make
some
tough
cuts
some
tough
decisions
on
the
spending
side
but
what
would
do
was
hurt
vulnerable
families
only
to
pay
for
tax
cut
for
somebody
like
me
and
what
said
was
that
the
ultimate
package
would
involve
balance
of
spending
cuts
and
tax
increases
that
exactly
what
put
forward
what
said
is
is
that
in
order
to
arrive
at
compromise
am
prepared
to
do
some
very
tough
things
some
things
that
some
democrats
do
want
to
see
and
probably
there
are
few
republicans
who
do
want
to
see
either
but
the
only
way
that
we
going
to
be
able
to
the
economy
make
sure
we
got
platform
for
economic
growth
that
we
get
our
deficits
under
control
and
we
make
sure
that
families
are
protected
is
if
we
come
up
with
something
that
members
of
both
parties
in
congress
can
support
and
that
the
plan
that
put
forward
have
gone
at
least
halfway
in
meeting
some
of
the
republicans
concerns
that
even
though
we
campaigned
on
these
issues
even
though
the
majority
of
americans
agree
with
me
that
we
should
be
raising
taxes
on
the
wealthiest
few
as
means
of
reducing
the
deficit
have
also
said
that
willing
to
identify
some
spending
cuts
that
make
sense
and
frankly
up
until
about
couple
of
days
ago
if
you
looked
at
it
the
republicans
in
the
house
and
speaker
think
were
in
position
to
say
we
gotten
fair
deal
the
fact
that
they
have
taken
it
yet
is
puzzling
and
think
question
that
you
going
to
have
to
address
to
them
remain
optimistic
though
because
if
you
look
at
what
the
speaker
has
proposed
he
conceded
that
income
tax
rates
should
go
up
except
right
now
he
only
wants
to
have
them
go
up
for
millionaires
if
you
making
somehow
he
thinks
that
you
afford
to
pay
little
more
in
taxes
but
the
principle
that
rates
are
going
to
need
to
go
up
he
conceded
said
willing
to
make
some
cuts
what
separates
us
is
probably
few
hundred
billion
dollars
the
idea
that
we
would
put
our
economy
at
risk
because
you
bridge
that
gap
make
lot
of
sense
so
going
to
continue
to
talk
to
the
speaker
and
the
other
leaders
up
in
congress
but
ultimately
they
got
to
do
their
job
right
now
their
job
is
to
make
sure
that
taxes
do
not
go
up
and
that
we
have
balanced
responsible
package
of
deficit
reduction
it
is
there
for
all
to
see
it
is
deal
that
can
get
done
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
it
can
not
be
done
if
every
side
wants
percent
and
part
of
what
voters
were
looking
for
is
some
compromise
up
here
what
folks
want
they
understand
that
they
not
going
to
get
percent
of
what
they
want
and
for
some
reason
that
message
has
not
yet
taken
up
on
capitol
hill
and
when
you
think
about
what
we
gone
through
over
the
last
couple
of
months
devastating
hurricane
and
now
one
of
the
worst
tragedies
in
our
memory
the
country
deserves
folks
to
be
willing
to
compromise
on
behalf
of
the
greater
good
and
not
tangle
themselves
up
in
whole
bunch
of
ideological
positions
that
make
much
sense
so
remain
not
only
open
to
conversations
but
remain
eager
to
get
something
done
like
to
get
it
done
before
there
been
lot
of
posturing
up
on
capitol
hill
instead
of
just
going
ahead
and
getting
stuff
done
and
we
been
wasting
lot
of
time
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
prepared
to
get
it
done
but
they
going
to
have
to
go
ahead
and
make
some
adjustments
and
just
give
you
one
other
example
the
speaker
now
is
proposing
what
he
calls
plan
so
he
says
well
this
would
raise
taxes
only
on
folks
making
million
dollars
or
more
what
that
means
is
an
average
of
tax
break
for
every
millionaire
out
there
at
the
same
time
as
we
not
providing
unemployment
insurance
for
million
people
who
are
still
out
there
looking
for
work
it
actually
means
tax
increase
for
millions
of
working
families
across
the
country
at
the
same
time
as
folks
like
me
would
be
getting
tax
break
that
violates
the
core
principles
that
were
debated
during
the
course
of
this
election
and
that
the
american
people
determined
was
the
wrong
way
to
go
and
so
my
hope
is
is
that
the
speaker
and
his
caucus
in
conjunction
with
the
other
legislative
leaders
up
there
can
find
way
to
make
sure
that
families
see
their
taxes
go
up
on
january
that
we
make
sure
that
those
things
that
families
count
on
like
tax
credits
for
college
or
making
sure
that
getting
some
help
when
it
comes
to
raising
their
kids
through
things
like
the
child
tax
credit
that
that
gets
done
and
that
we
have
balanced
package
for
deficit
reduction
which
is
exactly
what
put
forward
will
you
give
more
ground
if
you
need
to
or
are
you
done
the
president
if
you
look
at
the
package
that
put
forward
it
is
balanced
package
by
any
definition
we
have
put
forward
real
cuts
in
spending
that
are
hard
to
do
in
every
category
and
by
any
measure
by
any
traditional
calculation
by
the
measures
that
republicans
themselves
have
used
in
the
past
this
would
be
as
large
piece
of
deficit
reduction
as
seen
in
the
last
years
and
if
you
combine
that
with
the
increased
revenue
from
the
wealthy
paying
little
bit
more
then
you
actually
have
something
that
would
our
deficit
and
debt
for
decade
for
years
now
the
notion
that
we
would
not
do
that
but
instead
the
speaker
would
run
play
that
keeps
tax
cuts
for
folks
making
or
or
or
year
and
gives
more
tax
breaks
to
millionaires
and
billionaires
and
raises
taxes
on
families
and
then
has
no
cuts
in
it
which
is
what
he
says
he
wants
make
much
sense
mean
just
think
about
the
logic
for
second
thinking
about
voting
for
raising
taxes
at
least
on
folks
over
million
which
they
say
they
want
to
do
but
going
to
reject
spending
cuts
that
they
say
they
do
want
to
do
that
defies
logic
no
explanation
for
that
think
that
any
objective
person
out
there
looking
would
say
that
put
forward
very
balanced
plan
and
time
for
us
to
go
ahead
and
get
it
done
what
the
country
needs
right
now
because
think
folks
have
been
through
some
wrenching
times
still
recovering
from
very
tough
recession
and
what
hoping
for
is
sense
of
stability
focus
compromise
common
sense
over
the
next
couple
of
years
and
think
we
can
provide
it
but
this
is
good
test
for
them
carol
lee
thank
you
president
just
to
follow
on
ben
question
what
is
your
next
move
are
we
in
position
now
where
you
just
waiting
for
the
speaker
to
make
move
the
president
well
going
to
reach
out
to
all
the
leaders
involved
over
the
next
couple
of
days
and
find
out
what
is
it
that
holding
this
thing
up
what
is
holding
it
up
if
the
argument
from
republicans
is
we
have
done
enough
spending
cuts
that
argument
is
not
going
to
fly
because
we
got
close
to
trillion
dollars
of
spending
cuts
and
when
you
add
interest
then
it
more
than
trillion
dollars
in
spending
cuts
if
the
argument
is
that
they
do
they
increase
tax
rates
on
folks
making
or
year
that
not
persuasive
argument
to
me
and
it
certainly
not
persuasive
argument
to
the
american
people
it
may
be
that
members
of
their
caucus
have
looked
at
exactly
what
we
proposed
it
may
be
that
if
we
provide
more
information
or
there
greater
specificity
or
we
work
through
some
of
their
concerns
that
we
can
get
some
movement
then
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
is
that
what
would
violate
my
commitment
to
voters
is
if
ended
up
agreeing
to
plan
that
put
more
of
the
burden
on
families
and
less
of
burden
on
the
wealthy
in
an
effort
to
reduce
our
deficit
that
not
something
going
to
do
what
would
violate
my
commitment
to
voters
would
be
to
put
forward
plan
that
makes
it
harder
for
young
people
to
go
to
college
that
makes
it
harder
for
family
with
disabled
kid
to
care
for
that
kid
and
there
threshold
that
you
reach
where
the
balance
tips
even
in
making
compromises
that
are
required
to
get
something
done
in
this
town
where
you
are
hurting
people
in
order
to
give
another
advantage
to
folks
who
do
need
help
and
we
had
an
extensive
debate
about
this
for
year
and
not
only
does
the
majority
of
the
american
people
agree
with
me
about
half
of
republican
voters
agree
with
me
on
this
so
at
some
point
there
got
to
be
think
recognition
on
the
part
of
my
republican
friends
that
take
the
deal
they
will
be
able
to
claim
that
they
have
worked
with
me
over
the
last
two
years
to
reduce
the
deficit
more
than
any
other
deficit
reduction
package
that
we
will
have
it
for
years
that
is
significant
achievement
for
them
they
should
be
proud
of
it
but
they
keep
on
finding
ways
to
say
no
as
opposed
to
finding
ways
to
say
yes
and
know
how
much
of
that
just
has
to
do
with
it
is
very
hard
for
them
to
say
yes
to
me
but
at
some
point
got
to
take
me
out
of
it
and
think
about
their
voters
and
think
about
best
for
the
country
and
if
they
do
that
if
not
worried
about
winning
and
losing
did
they
score
point
on
the
president
did
they
extract
that
last
little
concession
did
they
force
him
to
do
something
he
really
want
to
do
just
for
the
heck
of
it
and
they
focus
on
actually
good
for
the
country
actually
think
we
can
get
this
done
you
mentioned
the
and
are
you
willing
to
move
on
income
level
and
are
there
specific
things
that
you
would
do
the
president
not
going
to
get
into
specific
negotiations
here
my
point
is
simple
carol
that
if
you
look
at
speaker
proposal
and
you
look
at
my
proposal
actually
pretty
close
they
keep
on
saying
that
somehow
we
put
forward
real
spending
cuts
actually
there
was
think
graph
in
the
new
york
times
today
that
showed
the
same
categories
right
little
bit
of
tweaks
here
and
there
there
are
few
differences
but
right
there
and
on
the
revenue
side
difference
in
terms
of
them
wanting
to
preserve
tax
breaks
for
folks
between
and
million
that
we
just
afford
mean
keep
in
mind
in
that
income
category
love
to
not
pay
as
much
in
taxes
but
also
think
the
right
thing
to
do
for
us
to
make
sure
that
people
who
have
less
people
who
are
working
people
who
are
striving
people
who
are
hoping
for
their
kids
that
they
have
opportunity
what
we
campaigned
about
what
we
talked
about
and
this
is
not
situation
where
unwilling
to
compromise
this
is
not
situation
where
trying
to
rub
their
face
in
anything
think
anybody
who
looks
at
this
objectively
would
say
that
coming
off
my
election
have
met
them
at
least
halfway
in
order
to
get
something
done
for
the
country
and
so
noticed
that
there
were
couple
of
headlines
out
there
saying
oh
now
in
the
land
of
political
posturing
and
the
usual
he
said
atmosphere
but
look
at
the
facts
look
at
where
we
started
look
at
where
they
started
my
proposal
is
right
there
in
the
middle
we
should
be
able
to
get
this
done
get
it
done
we
have
lot
of
time
there
you
are
thank
you
president
the
president
yes
what
is
your
level
of
confidence
that
if
you
are
able
to
reach
comprehensive
deal
with
the
speaker
that
he
will
be
able
to
bring
his
members
and
get
it
passed
essentially
do
you
still
trust
speaker
in
this
process
the
president
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
speaker
has
challenges
in
his
caucus
and
that
often
reminded
when
speak
to
the
republican
leadership
that
the
majority
of
their
membership
come
from
districts
that
lost
and
so
sometimes
they
may
not
see
an
incentive
in
cooperating
with
me
in
part
because
more
concerned
about
challenges
from
tea
party
candidate
or
challenges
from
the
right
and
cooperating
with
me
may
make
them
vulnerable
that
but
goodness
if
this
past
week
has
done
anything
it
should
just
give
us
some
perspective
if
one
thing
we
should
have
after
this
week
it
should
be
sense
of
perspective
about
important
and
would
like
to
think
that
members
of
that
caucus
would
say
to
themselves
you
know
what
we
disagree
with
the
president
on
whole
bunch
of
things
we
wish
the
other
guy
had
won
going
to
fight
him
on
whole
range
of
issues
over
the
next
four
years
we
think
his
philosophy
is
all
screwed
up
but
right
now
what
the
country
needs
is
for
us
to
compromise
get
deficit
reduction
deal
in
place
make
sure
middle
class
taxes
go
up
make
sure
that
laying
the
foundations
for
growth
give
certainty
to
businesses
large
and
small
not
put
ourselves
through
some
sort
of
crisis
every
six
months
allow
ourselves
time
to
focus
on
things
like
preventing
the
tragedy
in
from
happening
again
focus
on
issues
like
energy
and
immigration
reform
and
all
the
things
that
will
really
make
determination
as
to
whether
our
country
grows
over
the
next
four
years
years
years
and
if
you
just
pull
back
from
the
immediate
political
battles
if
you
kind
of
peel
off
the
partisan
war
paint
then
we
should
be
able
to
get
something
done
and
think
the
speaker
would
like
to
get
that
done
think
an
environment
needs
to
be
created
within
not
just
the
house
republican
caucus
but
also
among
senate
republicans
that
say
the
campaign
is
over
and
see
if
we
can
do
right
for
the
country
at
least
for
the
next
month
and
then
we
can
in
all
the
other
battles
that
want
to
fight
if
you
get
it
done
republicans
have
said
try
to
use
the
debt
limit
as
next
pressure
point
would
you
negotiate
with
them
in
that
context
the
president
no
and
been
very
clear
about
this
this
is
the
united
states
of
america
the
greatest
country
on
earth
the
economic
superpower
and
the
idea
that
we
lurch
from
crisis
to
crisis
and
every
six
months
or
every
nine
months
that
we
threaten
not
to
pay
our
bills
on
stuff
already
bought
and
default
and
ruin
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states
of
america
not
how
you
run
great
country
so
put
forward
very
clear
principle
will
not
negotiate
around
the
debt
ceiling
not
going
to
play
the
same
game
that
we
saw
happen
in
which
was
hugely
destructive
hurt
our
economy
provided
more
uncertainty
to
the
business
community
than
anything
else
that
happened
and
not
alone
in
this
if
you
go
to
wall
street
including
talking
to
whole
bunch
of
folks
who
spent
lot
of
money
trying
to
beat
me
they
would
say
it
would
be
disastrous
for
us
to
use
the
debt
ceiling
as
cudgel
to
try
to
win
political
points
on
capitol
hill
so
we
not
going
to
do
that
which
is
why
think
that
part
of
what
hope
over
the
next
couple
of
days
we
see
is
recognition
that
there
is
way
to
go
ahead
and
get
what
it
is
that
you
been
fighting
for
these
guys
have
been
fighting
for
spending
cuts
they
can
get
some
very
meaningful
spending
cuts
this
would
amount
to
trillion
trillion
in
spending
cuts
over
the
last
couple
of
years
and
in
exchange
they
getting
little
over
trillion
dollars
in
revenue
and
that
meets
the
pledge
that
made
during
the
campaign
which
was
to
of
spending
cuts
for
every
revenue
increase
and
that
an
approach
that
think
most
americans
think
is
appropriate
but
will
not
negotiate
around
the
debt
ceiling
we
not
going
to
do
that
again
sir
may
ask
question
about
please
the
president
yes
got
david
thank
you
president
getting
back
to
the
gun
issue
you
alluded
to
the
fact
that
washington
commissions
do
have
the
greatest
reputation
in
the
world
what
makes
you
think
this
one
is
going
to
be
different
given
the
passage
of
time
and
the
political
power
of
gun
rights
groups
like
the
national
rifle
association
the
president
well
this
is
not
going
to
be
commission
is
going
to
gather
up
some
key
cabinet
members
who
have
an
interest
in
this
issue
we
going
to
reach
out
to
bunch
of
stakeholders
we
going
to
be
reaching
out
to
members
of
congress
who
have
an
interest
in
this
issue
it
not
as
if
we
have
to
start
from
scratch
there
are
whole
bunch
of
proposals
that
have
been
thought
about
debated
but
hopefully
also
some
new
ideas
in
terms
of
how
we
deal
with
this
issue
their
task
is
going
to
be
to
sift
through
every
good
idea
that
out
there
and
even
take
look
at
some
bad
ideas
before
disposing
of
them
and
come
up
with
concrete
set
of
recommendations
in
about
month
and
would
hope
that
our
memories
are
so
short
that
what
we
saw
in
is
lingering
with
us
that
we
do
remain
passionate
about
it
only
month
later
and
as
soon
as
we
get
those
recommendations
will
be
putting
forward
very
specific
proposals
will
be
talking
about
them
in
my
state
of
the
union
and
we
will
be
working
with
interested
members
of
congress
to
try
to
get
some
of
them
done
and
the
idea
that
we
would
say
this
is
terrible
this
is
tragedy
never
again
and
we
have
the
sustained
attention
span
to
be
able
to
get
this
done
over
the
next
several
months
make
sense
have
more
confidence
in
the
american
people
than
that
have
more
confidence
in
the
parents
the
mothers
and
fathers
that
been
meeting
over
the
last
several
days
all
across
the
country
from
all
political
persuasions
including
lot
of
gun
owners
who
say
you
know
what
this
time
got
to
do
things
differently
what
about
the
the
president
well
the
is
an
that
has
members
who
are
mothers
and
fathers
and
would
expect
that
been
impacted
by
this
as
well
and
hopefully
do
some
and
what
we
know
that
any
single
gun
law
solve
all
these
problems
going
to
have
to
look
at
mental
health
issues
going
to
have
to
look
at
schools
there
are
going
to
be
whole
range
of
things
that
group
looks
at
we
know
that
issues
of
gun
safety
will
be
an
element
of
it
and
what
seen
over
the
last
years
years
is
the
sense
that
anything
related
to
guns
is
somehow
an
encroachment
on
the
second
amendment
what
looking
for
here
is
thoughtful
approach
that
says
we
can
preserve
our
second
amendment
we
can
make
sure
that
responsible
gun
owners
are
able
to
carry
out
their
activities
but
that
going
to
actually
be
serious
about
the
safety
side
of
this
that
going
to
be
serious
about
making
sure
that
something
like
or
aurora
happen
again
and
there
is
big
chunk
of
space
between
what
the
second
amendment
means
and
having
no
rules
at
all
and
that
space
is
what
is
going
to
be
working
on
to
try
to
identify
where
we
can
find
some
common
ground
so
got
going
to
take
one
last
question
go
ahead
it
seems
to
lot
of
observers
that
you
made
the
political
calculation
in
in
your
first
term
and
in
not
to
talk
about
gun
violence
you
had
your
position
on
renewing
the
ban
on
rifles
that
put
into
place
but
you
do
much
about
it
this
is
not
the
first
issue
the
first
incident
of
horrific
gun
violence
of
your
four
years
where
have
you
been
the
president
well
where
been
been
president
of
the
united
states
dealing
with
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
an
auto
industry
on
the
verge
of
collapse
two
wars
think
been
on
vacation
and
so
think
all
of
us
have
to
do
some
reflection
on
how
we
what
we
do
here
in
washington
and
as
said
on
sunday
this
should
be
call
for
all
of
us
to
say
that
if
we
are
not
getting
right
the
need
to
keep
our
children
safe
then
nothing
else
matters
and
my
commitment
to
make
sure
that
we
do
everything
we
can
to
keep
our
children
safe
lot
of
things
go
in
are
involved
in
that
so
making
sure
got
decent
health
care
and
making
sure
got
good
education
making
sure
that
their
parents
have
jobs
those
are
all
relevant
as
well
those
just
sort
of
side
issues
but
no
doubt
that
this
has
to
be
central
issue
and
exactly
why
confident
that
is
going
to
take
this
so
seriously
over
the
next
couple
months
all
right
thank
you
everybody
thank
you
governor
to
all
the
families
first
responders
to
the
community
of
clergy
guests
scripture
tells
us
do
not
lose
heart
though
outwardly
we
are
wasting
away
inwardly
we
are
being
renewed
day
by
day
for
light
and
momentary
troubles
are
achieving
for
us
an
eternal
glory
that
far
outweighs
them
all
so
we
fix
our
eyes
not
on
what
is
seen
but
on
what
is
unseen
since
what
is
seen
is
temporary
but
what
is
unseen
is
eternal
for
we
know
that
if
the
earthly
tent
we
live
in
is
destroyed
we
have
building
from
god
an
eternal
house
in
heaven
not
built
by
human
hands
we
gather
here
in
memory
of
twenty
beautiful
children
and
six
remarkable
adults
they
lost
their
lives
in
school
that
could
have
been
any
school
in
quiet
town
full
of
good
and
decent
people
that
could
be
any
town
in
america
here
in
come
to
offer
the
love
and
prayers
of
nation
am
very
mindful
that
mere
words
can
not
match
the
depths
of
your
sorrow
nor
can
they
heal
your
wounded
hearts
can
only
hope
it
helps
for
you
to
know
that
not
alone
in
your
grief
that
our
world
too
has
been
torn
apart
that
all
across
this
land
of
ours
we
have
wept
with
you
pulled
our
children
tight
and
you
must
know
that
whatever
measure
of
comfort
we
can
provide
we
will
provide
whatever
portion
of
sadness
that
we
can
share
with
you
to
ease
this
heavy
load
we
will
gladly
bear
it
you
are
not
alone
as
these
difficult
days
have
unfolded
also
inspired
us
with
stories
of
strength
and
resolve
and
sacrifice
we
know
that
when
danger
arrived
in
the
halls
of
sandy
hook
elementary
the
staff
did
not
flinch
they
did
not
hesitate
dawn
and
mary
and
they
responded
as
we
all
hope
we
might
respond
in
such
terrifying
circumstances
with
courage
and
with
love
giving
their
lives
to
protect
the
children
in
their
care
we
know
that
there
were
other
teachers
who
barricaded
themselves
inside
classrooms
and
kept
steady
through
it
all
and
reassured
their
students
by
saying
wait
for
the
good
guys
coming
show
me
your
smile
and
we
know
that
good
guys
came
the
first
responders
who
raced
to
the
scene
helping
to
guide
those
in
way
to
safety
and
comfort
those
in
need
holding
at
bay
their
own
shock
and
trauma
because
they
had
job
to
do
and
others
needed
them
more
and
then
there
were
the
scenes
of
the
schoolchildren
helping
one
another
holding
each
other
dutifully
following
instructions
in
the
way
that
young
children
sometimes
do
one
child
even
trying
to
encourage
by
saying
know
karate
so
okay
lead
the
way
out
as
community
inspired
us
in
the
face
of
indescribable
violence
in
the
face
of
unconscionable
evil
looked
out
for
each
other
and
cared
for
one
another
and
loved
one
another
this
is
how
will
be
remembered
and
with
time
and
grace
that
love
will
see
you
through
but
we
as
nation
we
are
left
with
some
hard
questions
someone
once
described
the
joy
and
anxiety
of
parenthood
as
the
equivalent
of
having
your
heart
outside
of
your
body
all
the
time
walking
around
with
their
very
first
cry
this
most
precious
vital
part
of
ourselves
our
child
is
suddenly
exposed
to
the
world
to
possible
mishap
or
malice
and
every
parent
knows
there
is
nothing
we
will
not
do
to
shield
our
children
from
harm
and
yet
we
also
know
that
with
that
very
first
step
and
each
step
after
that
they
are
separating
from
us
that
we
that
we
always
be
there
for
them
suffer
sickness
and
setbacks
and
broken
hearts
and
disappointments
and
we
learn
that
our
most
important
job
is
to
give
them
what
they
need
to
become
and
capable
and
resilient
ready
to
face
the
world
without
fear
and
we
know
we
do
this
by
ourselves
it
comes
as
shock
at
certain
point
where
you
no
matter
how
much
you
love
these
kids
you
do
it
by
yourself
that
this
job
of
keeping
our
children
safe
and
teaching
them
well
is
something
we
can
only
do
together
with
the
help
of
friends
and
the
help
of
community
and
the
help
of
nation
and
in
that
way
we
come
to
that
we
bear
responsibility
for
every
child
because
counting
on
everybody
else
to
help
look
after
ours
that
all
parents
that
all
our
children
this
is
our
first
task
caring
for
our
children
our
first
job
if
we
get
that
right
we
get
anything
right
how
as
society
we
will
be
judged
and
by
that
measure
can
we
truly
say
as
nation
that
we
are
meeting
our
obligations
can
we
honestly
say
that
doing
enough
to
keep
our
children
all
of
them
safe
from
harm
can
we
claim
as
nation
that
all
together
there
letting
them
know
that
they
are
loved
and
teaching
them
to
love
in
return
can
we
say
that
truly
doing
enough
to
give
all
the
children
of
this
country
the
chance
they
deserve
to
live
out
their
lives
in
happiness
and
with
purpose
been
reflecting
on
this
the
last
few
days
and
if
honest
with
ourselves
the
answer
is
no
not
doing
enough
and
we
will
have
to
change
since
been
president
this
is
the
fourth
time
we
have
come
together
to
comfort
grieving
community
torn
apart
by
mass
shooting
the
fourth
time
hugged
survivors
the
fourth
time
consoled
the
families
of
victims
and
in
between
there
have
been
an
endless
series
of
deadly
shootings
across
the
country
almost
daily
reports
of
victims
many
of
them
children
in
small
towns
and
big
cities
all
across
america
victims
whose
much
of
the
time
their
only
fault
was
being
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
we
tolerate
this
anymore
these
tragedies
must
end
and
to
end
them
we
must
change
we
will
be
told
that
the
causes
of
such
violence
are
complex
and
that
is
true
no
single
law
no
set
of
laws
can
eliminate
evil
from
the
world
or
prevent
every
senseless
act
of
violence
in
our
society
but
that
be
an
excuse
for
inaction
surely
we
can
do
better
than
this
if
there
is
even
one
step
we
can
take
to
save
another
child
or
another
parent
or
another
town
from
the
grief
that
has
visited
and
aurora
and
oak
creek
and
and
communities
from
to
before
that
then
surely
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
in
the
coming
weeks
will
use
whatever
power
this
office
holds
to
engage
my
fellow
citizens
from
law
enforcement
to
mental
health
professionals
to
parents
and
educators
in
an
effort
aimed
at
preventing
more
tragedies
like
this
because
what
choice
do
we
have
we
accept
events
like
this
as
routine
are
we
really
prepared
to
say
that
powerless
in
the
face
of
such
carnage
that
the
politics
are
too
hard
are
we
prepared
to
say
that
such
violence
visited
on
our
children
year
after
year
after
year
is
somehow
the
price
of
our
freedom
all
the
religions
so
many
of
them
represented
here
today
start
with
simple
question
why
are
we
here
what
gives
our
life
meaning
what
gives
our
acts
purpose
we
know
our
time
on
this
earth
is
fleeting
we
know
that
we
will
each
have
our
share
of
pleasure
and
pain
that
even
after
we
chase
after
some
earthly
goal
whether
wealth
or
power
or
fame
or
just
simple
comfort
we
will
in
some
fashion
fall
short
of
what
we
had
hoped
we
know
that
no
matter
how
good
our
intentions
we
will
all
stumble
sometimes
in
some
way
we
will
make
mistakes
we
will
experience
hardships
and
even
when
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
we
know
that
much
of
our
time
will
be
spent
groping
through
the
darkness
so
often
unable
to
discern
heavenly
plans
only
one
thing
we
can
be
sure
of
and
that
is
the
love
that
we
have
for
our
children
for
our
families
for
each
other
the
warmth
of
small
embrace
that
is
true
the
memories
we
have
of
them
the
joy
that
they
bring
the
wonder
we
see
through
their
eyes
that
fierce
and
boundless
love
we
feel
for
them
love
that
takes
us
out
of
ourselves
and
binds
us
to
something
larger
we
know
what
matters
we
know
always
doing
right
when
taking
care
of
them
when
teaching
them
well
when
showing
acts
of
kindness
we
go
wrong
when
we
do
that
what
we
can
be
sure
of
and
what
you
the
people
of
have
reminded
us
how
inspired
us
you
remind
us
what
matters
and
what
should
drive
us
forward
in
everything
we
do
for
as
long
as
god
sees
fit
to
keep
us
on
this
earth
the
little
children
come
to
me
jesus
said
do
not
hinder
them
for
to
such
belongs
the
kingdom
of
daniel
ana
chase
james
grace
jack
noah
benjamin
god
has
called
them
all
home
for
those
of
us
who
remain
let
us
find
the
strength
to
carry
on
and
make
our
country
worthy
of
their
memory
may
god
bless
and
keep
those
lost
in
his
heavenly
place
may
he
grace
those
we
still
have
with
his
holy
comfort
and
may
he
bless
and
watch
over
this
community
and
the
united
states
of
america
this
afternoon
spoke
with
governor
and
director
offered
governor
my
condolences
on
behalf
of
the
nation
and
made
it
clear
he
will
have
every
single
resource
that
he
needs
to
investigate
this
heinous
crime
care
for
the
victims
counsel
their
families
endured
too
many
of
these
tragedies
in
the
past
few
years
and
each
time
learn
the
news
react
not
as
president
but
as
anybody
else
would
as
parent
and
that
was
especially
true
today
know
not
parent
in
america
who
feel
the
same
overwhelming
grief
that
do
the
majority
of
those
who
died
today
were
children
beautiful
little
kids
between
the
ages
of
and
years
old
they
had
their
entire
lives
ahead
of
them
birthdays
graduations
weddings
kids
of
their
own
among
the
fallen
were
also
teachers
men
and
women
who
devoted
their
lives
to
helping
our
children
their
dreams
so
our
hearts
are
broken
today
for
the
parents
and
grandparents
sisters
and
brothers
of
these
little
children
and
for
the
families
of
the
adults
who
were
lost
our
hearts
are
broken
for
the
parents
of
the
survivors
as
well
for
as
blessed
as
they
are
to
have
their
children
home
tonight
they
know
that
their
innocence
has
been
torn
away
from
them
too
early
and
there
are
no
words
that
will
ease
their
pain
as
country
we
have
been
through
this
too
many
times
whether
an
elementary
school
in
or
shopping
mall
in
or
temple
in
or
movie
in
aurora
or
street
corner
in
chicago
these
are
our
and
these
children
are
our
children
and
we
going
to
have
to
come
together
and
take
meaningful
action
to
prevent
more
tragedies
like
this
regardless
of
the
politics
this
evening
and
will
do
what
know
every
parent
in
america
will
do
which
is
hug
our
children
little
tighter
and
tell
them
that
we
love
them
and
remind
each
other
how
deeply
we
love
one
another
but
there
are
families
in
who
can
not
do
that
tonight
and
they
need
all
of
us
right
now
in
the
hard
days
to
come
that
community
needs
us
to
be
at
our
best
as
americans
and
will
do
everything
in
my
power
as
president
to
help
because
while
nothing
can
fill
the
space
of
lost
child
or
loved
one
all
of
us
can
extend
hand
to
those
in
need
to
remind
them
that
we
are
there
for
them
that
we
are
praying
for
them
that
the
love
they
felt
for
those
they
lost
endures
not
just
in
their
memories
but
also
in
ours
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
the
victims
and
in
the
words
of
scripture
heal
the
brokenhearted
and
bind
up
their
wounds
thank
you
well
good
afternoon
everybody
now
that
those
of
us
on
the
campaign
trail
have
had
chance
to
get
little
sleep
time
to
get
back
to
work
and
there
is
plenty
of
work
to
do
as
said
on
tuesday
night
the
american
people
voted
for
action
not
politics
as
usual
you
elected
us
to
focus
on
your
jobs
not
ours
and
in
that
spirit
invited
leaders
of
both
parties
to
the
white
house
next
week
so
we
can
start
to
build
consensus
around
the
challenges
that
we
can
only
solve
together
and
also
intend
to
bring
in
business
and
and
civic
leaders
from
all
across
the
country
here
to
washington
to
get
their
ideas
and
input
as
well
at
time
when
our
economy
is
still
recovering
from
the
great
recession
our
top
priority
has
to
be
jobs
and
growth
the
focus
of
the
plan
talked
about
during
the
campaign
plan
to
reward
small
businesses
and
manufacturers
that
create
jobs
here
not
overseas
plan
to
give
people
the
chance
to
get
the
education
and
training
that
businesses
are
looking
for
right
now
plan
to
make
sure
this
country
is
global
leader
in
research
and
technology
and
clean
energy
which
will
attract
new
companies
and
jobs
to
america
plan
to
put
folks
back
to
work
including
our
veterans
rebuilding
our
roads
and
our
bridges
and
other
infrastructure
and
plan
to
reduce
our
deficit
in
balanced
and
responsible
way
our
work
is
made
that
much
more
urgent
because
at
the
end
of
this
year
we
face
series
of
deadlines
that
require
us
to
make
major
decisions
about
how
to
pay
our
deficit
down
decisions
that
will
have
huge
impact
on
the
economy
and
the
middle
class
both
now
and
in
the
future
last
year
worked
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
cut
trillion
worth
of
spending
that
we
just
afford
intend
to
work
with
both
parties
to
do
more
and
that
includes
making
reforms
that
will
bring
down
the
cost
of
health
care
so
we
can
strengthen
programs
like
and
for
the
long
haul
but
as
said
before
we
just
cut
our
way
to
prosperity
if
serious
about
reducing
the
deficit
we
have
to
combine
spending
cuts
with
revenue
and
that
means
asking
the
wealthiest
americans
to
pay
little
more
in
taxes
how
we
did
it
that
how
we
did
it
in
the
when
bill
was
president
how
we
can
reduce
the
deficit
while
still
making
the
investments
we
need
to
build
strong
middle
class
and
strong
economy
the
only
way
we
can
still
afford
to
train
our
workers
or
help
our
kids
pay
for
college
or
make
sure
that
good
jobs
in
clean
energy
or
manufacturing
end
up
in
countries
like
china
now
already
put
forward
detailed
plan
that
allows
us
to
make
these
investments
while
reducing
our
deficit
by
trillion
dollars
over
the
next
decade
want
to
be
clear
not
wedded
to
every
detail
of
my
plan
open
to
compromise
open
to
new
ideas
committed
to
solving
our
fiscal
challenges
but
refuse
to
accept
any
approach
that
balanced
am
not
going
to
ask
students
and
seniors
and
families
to
pay
down
the
entire
deficit
while
people
like
me
making
over
dollars
asked
to
pay
dime
more
in
taxes
not
going
to
do
that
and
just
want
to
point
out
this
was
central
question
during
the
election
it
was
debated
over
and
over
again
and
on
tuesday
night
we
found
out
that
the
majority
of
americans
agree
with
my
approach
and
that
includes
democrats
independents
and
lot
of
republicans
across
the
country
as
well
as
independent
economists
and
budget
experts
how
you
reduce
the
deficit
with
balanced
approach
so
our
job
now
is
to
get
majority
in
congress
to
reflect
the
will
of
the
american
people
and
believe
we
can
get
that
majority
was
encouraged
to
hear
speaker
agree
that
tax
revenue
has
to
be
part
of
this
equation
so
look
forward
to
hearing
his
ideas
when
see
him
next
week
and
let
me
make
one
final
point
that
every
american
needs
to
hear
right
now
if
congress
fails
to
come
to
an
agreement
on
an
overall
deficit
reduction
package
by
the
end
of
the
year
taxes
will
automatically
go
up
on
january
including
the
percent
of
americans
who
make
less
than
dollars
year
and
that
makes
no
sense
it
would
be
bad
for
the
economy
and
would
hit
families
that
are
already
struggling
to
make
ends
meet
now
fortunately
we
need
long
negotiations
or
drama
to
solve
that
part
of
the
problem
while
there
may
be
disagreement
in
congress
over
whether
or
not
to
raise
taxes
on
folks
making
over
dollars
year
nobody
not
republicans
not
democrats
want
taxes
to
go
up
for
folks
making
under
dollars
year
so
not
wait
even
as
negotiating
broader
deficit
reduction
package
extend
the
tax
cuts
right
now
let
do
that
right
now
that
one
step
that
one
step
would
give
millions
of
families
percent
of
americans
and
percent
of
small
businesses
the
certainty
that
they
need
going
into
the
new
year
it
would
immediately
take
huge
chunk
of
the
economic
uncertainty
off
the
table
and
that
will
lead
to
new
jobs
and
faster
growth
business
will
know
that
consumers
they
not
going
to
see
big
tax
increase
they
know
that
most
small
businesses
see
tax
increase
and
so
lot
of
the
uncertainty
that
you
reading
about
that
will
be
removed
in
fact
the
senate
has
already
passed
bill
doing
exactly
this
so
all
we
need
is
action
from
the
house
and
got
the
pen
ready
to
sign
the
bill
right
away
ready
to
do
it
ready
to
do
it
the
american
people
understand
that
going
to
have
differences
and
disagreements
in
the
months
to
come
they
get
that
but
on
tuesday
they
said
loud
and
clear
that
they
tolerate
dysfunction
they
tolerate
politicians
who
view
compromise
as
dirty
word
not
when
so
many
americans
are
still
out
of
work
not
when
so
many
families
and
small
business
owners
are
still
struggling
to
pay
the
bills
what
the
american
people
are
looking
for
is
cooperation
they
looking
for
consensus
they
looking
for
common
sense
most
of
all
they
want
action
intend
to
deliver
for
them
in
my
second
term
and
expect
to
find
willing
partners
in
both
parties
to
make
that
happen
so
get
to
work
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
tonight
more
than
years
after
former
colony
won
the
right
to
determine
its
own
destiny
the
task
of
perfecting
our
union
moves
forward
it
moves
forward
because
of
you
it
moves
forward
because
you
reaffirmed
the
spirit
that
has
triumphed
over
war
and
depression
the
spirit
that
has
lifted
this
country
from
the
depths
of
despair
to
the
great
heights
of
hope
the
belief
that
while
each
of
us
will
pursue
our
own
individual
dreams
we
are
an
american
family
and
we
rise
or
fall
together
as
one
nation
and
as
one
people
tonight
in
this
election
you
the
american
people
reminded
us
that
while
our
road
has
been
hard
while
our
journey
has
been
long
we
have
picked
ourselves
up
we
have
fought
our
way
back
and
we
know
in
our
hearts
that
for
the
united
states
of
america
the
best
is
yet
to
come
want
to
thank
every
american
who
participated
in
this
election
whether
you
voted
for
the
very
first
time
or
waited
in
line
for
very
long
time
by
the
way
we
have
to
fix
that
whether
you
pounded
the
pavement
or
picked
up
the
phone
whether
you
held
an
sign
or
sign
you
made
your
voice
heard
and
you
made
difference
just
spoke
with
governor
and
congratulated
him
and
paul
on
campaign
we
may
have
battled
fiercely
but
only
because
we
love
this
country
deeply
and
we
care
so
strongly
about
its
future
from
george
to
to
their
son
mitt
the
family
has
chosen
to
give
back
to
america
through
public
service
and
that
is
legacy
that
we
and
applaud
tonight
in
the
weeks
ahead
also
look
forward
to
sitting
down
with
governor
to
talk
about
where
we
can
work
together
to
move
this
country
forward
want
to
thank
my
friend
and
partner
of
the
last
four
years
happy
warrior
the
best
vice
president
anybody
could
ever
hope
for
and
be
the
man
am
today
without
the
woman
who
agreed
to
marry
me
years
ago
let
me
say
this
publicly
have
never
loved
you
more
have
never
been
prouder
to
watch
the
rest
of
america
fall
in
love
with
you
too
as
our
first
lady
and
before
our
very
eyes
you
growing
up
to
become
two
strong
smart
beautiful
young
women
just
like
your
mom
and
so
proud
of
you
guys
but
will
say
that
for
now
one
dog
is
probably
enough
to
the
best
campaign
team
and
volunteers
in
the
history
of
politics
the
best
the
best
ever
some
of
you
were
new
this
time
around
and
some
of
you
have
been
at
my
side
since
the
very
beginning
but
all
of
you
are
family
no
matter
what
you
do
or
where
you
go
from
here
you
will
carry
the
memory
of
the
history
we
made
together
and
you
will
have
the
lifelong
appreciation
of
grateful
president
thank
you
for
believing
all
the
way
through
every
hill
through
every
valley
you
lifted
me
up
the
whole
way
and
will
always
be
grateful
for
everything
that
you
done
and
all
the
incredible
work
that
you
put
in
know
that
political
campaigns
can
sometimes
seem
small
even
silly
and
that
provides
plenty
of
fodder
for
the
cynics
who
tell
us
that
politics
is
nothing
more
than
contest
of
or
the
domain
of
special
interests
but
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
talk
to
folks
who
turned
out
at
our
rallies
and
crowded
along
rope
line
in
high
school
gym
or
saw
folks
working
late
at
campaign
office
in
some
tiny
county
far
away
from
home
you
discover
something
else
hear
the
determination
in
the
voice
of
young
field
worked
his
way
through
college
and
wants
to
make
sure
every
child
has
that
same
opportunity
hear
the
pride
in
the
voice
of
volunteer
going
door
to
door
because
her
brother
was
finally
hired
when
the
local
auto
plant
added
another
shift
hear
the
deep
patriotism
in
the
voice
of
military
spouse
working
the
phones
late
at
night
to
make
sure
that
no
one
who
fights
for
this
country
ever
has
to
fight
for
job
or
roof
over
their
head
when
they
come
home
why
we
do
this
what
politics
can
be
why
elections
matter
it
not
small
it
big
it
important
democracy
in
nation
of
million
can
be
noisy
and
messy
and
complicated
we
have
our
own
opinions
each
of
us
has
deeply
held
beliefs
and
when
we
go
through
tough
times
when
we
make
big
decisions
as
country
it
necessarily
stirs
passions
stirs
up
controversy
that
change
after
tonight
and
it
these
arguments
we
have
are
mark
of
our
liberty
and
we
can
never
forget
that
as
we
speak
people
in
distant
nations
are
risking
their
lives
right
now
just
for
chance
to
argue
about
the
issues
that
matter
the
chance
to
cast
their
ballots
like
we
did
today
but
despite
all
our
differences
most
of
us
share
certain
hopes
for
future
we
want
our
kids
to
grow
up
in
country
where
they
have
access
to
the
best
schools
and
the
best
teachers
country
that
lives
up
to
its
legacy
as
the
global
leader
in
technology
and
discovery
and
innovation
with
all
the
good
jobs
and
new
businesses
that
follow
we
want
our
children
to
live
in
an
america
that
burdened
by
debt
that
weakened
by
inequality
that
threatened
by
the
destructive
power
of
warming
planet
we
want
to
pass
on
country
safe
and
respected
and
admired
around
the
world
nation
that
is
defended
by
the
strongest
military
on
earth
and
the
best
troops
this
world
has
ever
known
but
also
country
that
moves
with
confidence
beyond
this
time
of
war
to
shape
peace
that
is
built
on
the
promise
of
freedom
and
dignity
for
every
human
being
we
believe
in
generous
america
in
compassionate
america
in
tolerant
america
open
to
the
dreams
of
an
daughter
who
studies
in
our
schools
and
pledges
to
our
flag
to
the
young
boy
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
who
sees
life
beyond
the
nearest
street
corner
to
the
furniture
child
in
north
who
wants
to
become
doctor
or
scientist
an
engineer
or
entrepreneur
diplomat
or
even
president
the
future
we
hope
for
the
vision
we
share
where
we
need
to
go
forward
that
where
we
need
to
go
now
we
will
disagree
sometimes
fiercely
about
how
to
get
there
as
it
has
for
more
than
two
centuries
progress
will
come
in
fits
and
starts
it
not
always
straight
line
it
not
always
smooth
path
by
itself
the
recognition
that
we
have
common
hopes
and
dreams
end
all
the
gridlock
or
solve
all
our
problems
or
substitute
for
the
painstaking
work
of
building
consensus
and
making
the
difficult
compromises
needed
to
move
this
country
forward
but
that
common
bond
is
where
we
must
begin
our
economy
is
recovering
decade
of
war
is
ending
long
campaign
is
now
over
and
whether
earned
your
vote
or
not
have
listened
to
you
have
learned
from
you
and
you
made
me
better
president
with
your
stories
and
your
struggles
return
to
the
white
house
more
determined
and
more
inspired
than
ever
about
the
work
there
is
to
do
and
the
future
that
lies
ahead
tonight
you
voted
for
action
not
politics
as
usual
you
elected
us
to
focus
on
your
jobs
not
ours
and
in
the
coming
weeks
and
months
am
looking
forward
to
reaching
out
and
working
with
leaders
of
both
parties
to
meet
the
challenges
we
can
only
solve
together
reducing
our
deficit
reforming
our
tax
code
fixing
our
immigration
system
freeing
ourselves
from
foreign
oil
we
got
more
work
to
do
but
that
mean
your
work
is
done
the
role
of
citizen
in
our
democracy
does
not
end
with
your
vote
america
has
never
been
about
what
can
be
done
for
us
about
what
can
be
done
by
us
together
through
the
hard
and
frustrating
but
necessary
work
of
that
the
principle
we
were
founded
on
this
country
has
more
wealth
than
any
nation
but
not
what
makes
us
rich
we
have
the
most
powerful
military
in
history
but
not
what
makes
us
strong
our
university
culture
are
the
envy
of
the
world
but
not
what
keeps
the
world
coming
to
our
shores
what
makes
america
exceptional
are
the
bonds
that
hold
together
the
most
diverse
nation
on
earth
the
belief
that
our
destiny
is
shared
that
this
country
only
works
when
we
accept
certain
obligations
to
one
another
and
to
future
generations
that
the
freedom
which
so
many
americans
have
fought
for
and
died
for
comes
with
responsibilities
as
well
as
rights
and
among
those
are
love
and
charity
and
duty
and
patriotism
that
what
makes
america
great
am
hopeful
tonight
because
have
seen
this
spirit
at
work
in
america
seen
it
in
the
family
business
whose
owners
would
rather
cut
their
own
pay
than
lay
off
their
and
in
the
workers
who
would
rather
cut
back
their
hours
than
see
friend
lose
job
seen
it
in
the
soldiers
who
after
losing
limb
and
in
those
seals
who
charged
up
the
stairs
into
darkness
and
danger
because
they
knew
there
was
buddy
behind
them
watching
their
back
seen
it
on
the
shores
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
where
leaders
from
every
party
and
level
of
government
have
swept
aside
their
differences
to
help
community
rebuild
from
the
wreckage
of
terrible
storm
and
saw
it
just
the
other
day
in
mentor
ohio
where
father
told
the
story
of
his
daughter
whose
long
battle
with
leukemia
nearly
cost
their
family
everything
had
it
not
been
for
health
care
reform
passing
just
few
months
before
the
insurance
company
was
about
to
stop
paying
for
her
care
had
an
opportunity
to
not
just
talk
to
the
father
but
meet
this
incredible
daughter
of
his
and
when
he
spoke
to
the
crowd
listening
to
that
story
every
parent
in
that
room
had
tears
in
their
eyes
because
we
knew
that
little
girl
could
be
our
own
and
know
that
every
american
wants
her
future
to
be
just
as
bright
who
we
are
the
country
so
proud
to
lead
as
your
president
and
tonight
despite
all
the
hardship
been
through
despite
all
the
frustrations
of
washington
never
been
more
hopeful
about
our
future
have
never
been
more
hopeful
about
america
and
ask
you
to
sustain
that
hope
not
talking
about
blind
optimism
the
kind
of
hope
that
just
ignores
the
enormity
of
the
tasks
ahead
or
the
roadblocks
that
stand
in
our
path
not
talking
about
the
wishful
idealism
that
allows
us
to
just
sit
on
the
sidelines
or
shirk
from
fight
have
always
believed
that
hope
is
that
stubborn
thing
inside
us
that
insists
despite
all
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
something
better
awaits
us
so
long
as
we
have
the
courage
to
keep
reaching
to
keep
working
to
keep
fighting
america
believe
we
can
build
on
the
progress
made
and
continue
to
fight
for
new
jobs
and
new
opportunity
and
new
security
for
the
middle
class
believe
we
can
keep
the
promise
of
our
founding
the
idea
that
if
willing
to
work
hard
it
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
or
what
you
look
like
or
where
you
love
it
matter
whether
you
black
or
white
or
hispanic
or
asian
or
native
american
or
young
or
old
or
rich
or
poor
disabled
gay
or
straight
you
can
make
it
here
in
america
if
willing
to
try
believe
we
can
seize
this
future
together
because
we
are
not
as
divided
as
our
politics
suggest
we
not
as
cynical
as
the
pundits
believe
we
are
greater
than
the
sum
of
our
individual
ambitions
and
we
remain
more
than
collection
of
red
states
and
blue
states
we
are
and
forever
will
be
the
united
states
of
america
and
together
with
your
help
and
grace
we
will
continue
our
journey
forward
and
remind
the
world
just
why
it
is
that
we
live
in
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
thank
you
america
god
bless
you
god
bless
these
united
states
alright
first
of
all
want
to
thank
and
charlie
who
are
on
the
scene
doing
work
every
time
we
have
disaster
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
but
obviously
the
red
cross
is
doing
outstanding
work
internationally
so
we
want
to
thank
them
for
their
outstanding
work
few
things
that
want
to
to
the
public
at
the
top
this
storm
is
not
yet
over
gotten
briefings
from
the
national
hurricane
it
is
still
moving
north
there
are
still
communities
that
could
be
affected
and
so
want
to
there
are
still
risks
of
flooding
there
are
still
risks
of
down
power
lines
risks
of
high
winds
and
so
it
is
very
important
for
the
public
to
continue
to
monitor
the
situation
in
your
local
community
listen
to
your
state
and
local
officials
follow
instructions
the
more
you
follow
instructions
the
easier
it
is
for
our
first
responders
to
make
sure
that
they
are
dealing
with
true
emergency
situations
so
the
better
prepared
individual
families
are
for
the
situation
the
easier
it
is
going
to
be
for
us
to
deal
with
it
next
obviously
want
to
talk
about
the
extraordinary
hardship
that
seen
over
the
last
hours
our
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
all
the
families
who
have
lost
loved
ones
unfortunately
there
have
been
fatalities
as
consequence
of
hurricane
sandy
and
not
clear
that
counted
up
all
the
fatalities
at
this
point
and
obviously
this
is
something
that
is
heartbreaking
for
the
entire
nation
and
we
certainly
feel
profoundly
for
all
the
families
whose
lives
have
been
upended
and
are
going
to
be
going
through
some
very
tough
times
over
the
next
several
days
and
perhaps
several
weeks
and
months
the
most
important
message
have
for
them
is
that
america
is
with
you
we
are
standing
behind
you
and
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
help
you
get
back
on
your
feet
earlier
today
had
conversation
with
the
governors
and
many
of
the
mayors
in
the
affected
areas
including
governor
governor
and
mayor
want
to
praise
them
for
the
extraordinary
work
that
they
have
done
sadly
we
are
getting
more
experience
with
these
kinds
of
big
impact
storms
along
the
east
coast
and
the
preparation
shows
were
it
not
for
the
outstanding
work
that
they
and
their
teams
have
already
done
and
will
continue
to
do
in
the
affected
regions
we
could
have
seen
more
deaths
and
more
property
damage
so
they
have
done
extraordinary
work
working
around
the
clock
the
coordination
between
the
state
local
and
federal
governments
has
been
outstanding
obviously
now
moving
into
the
recovery
phase
in
lot
of
the
most
severely
affected
areas
new
jersey
new
york
in
particular
have
been
pounded
by
this
storm
has
taken
big
hit
because
of
some
of
the
work
that
had
been
done
ahead
of
time
been
able
to
get
over
thousand
officials
in
place
been
able
to
get
supplies
food
medicine
water
emergency
generators
to
ensure
that
hospitals
and
law
enforcement
offices
are
able
to
stay
up
and
running
as
they
are
out
there
responding
we
are
going
to
continue
to
push
as
hard
as
we
can
to
make
sure
that
power
is
up
throughout
the
region
and
obviously
this
is
mostly
local
responsibility
and
the
private
utilities
are
going
to
have
to
lean
forward
but
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
provide
them
additional
resources
so
that
we
can
expedite
getting
power
up
and
running
in
many
of
these
communities
there
are
places
like
new
jersey
for
example
where
got
percent
of
the
people
without
power
we
have
situation
where
that
lasts
for
days
on
end
and
so
my
instructions
to
the
federal
agency
has
been
do
not
figure
out
why
we
do
something
want
you
to
figure
out
how
we
do
something
want
you
to
cut
through
red
tape
want
you
to
cut
through
bureaucracy
no
excuse
for
inaction
at
this
point
want
every
agency
to
lean
forward
and
to
make
sure
that
we
are
getting
the
resources
where
they
need
where
they
needed
as
quickly
as
possible
so
want
to
repeat
my
message
to
the
federal
government
no
bureaucracy
no
red
tape
get
resources
where
they
needed
as
fast
as
possible
as
hard
as
possible
and
for
the
duration
because
the
recovery
process
obviously
in
place
like
new
jersey
is
going
to
take
significant
amount
of
time
the
recovery
process
in
lower
is
going
to
take
lot
of
time
and
part
of
what
trying
to
do
here
is
also
to
see
where
are
some
resources
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
that
maybe
traditionally
are
not
used
in
these
kind
of
disaster
situations
for
example
there
may
be
military
assets
that
allow
us
to
help
move
equipment
to
ensure
that
pumping
and
getting
the
flooding
out
of
new
york
subway
systems
can
proceed
more
quickly
there
may
be
resources
that
we
can
bring
to
bear
to
help
some
of
the
private
utilities
get
their
personnel
and
their
equipment
in
place
more
swiftly
so
that
we
can
get
power
up
and
running
as
soon
as
possible
so
my
message
to
the
governors
and
the
mayors
and
through
them
to
the
communities
that
have
been
hit
so
hard
is
that
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
get
resources
to
you
and
make
sure
that
any
unmet
need
that
is
identified
we
are
responding
to
it
as
quickly
as
possible
and
told
the
mayors
and
the
governors
if
they
getting
no
for
an
answer
somewhere
in
the
federal
government
they
can
call
me
personally
at
the
white
house
now
obviously
the
state
local
federal
response
is
important
but
what
we
do
as
community
what
we
do
as
and
as
fellow
citizens
is
equally
important
so
couple
of
things
that
want
the
public
to
know
they
can
do
first
of
all
because
our
local
law
enforcement
our
first
responders
are
being
swamped
to
the
extent
that
everybody
can
be
out
there
looking
out
for
their
especially
older
folks
think
that
really
important
if
got
nearby
not
sure
how
they
handling
power
outage
flooding
go
over
visit
them
knock
on
their
door
make
sure
that
they
doing
okay
that
can
make
big
difference
the
public
can
be
the
eyes
and
ears
in
terms
of
identifying
unmet
needs
second
thing
the
reason
here
is
because
the
red
cross
knows
what
doing
when
it
comes
to
emergency
response
and
so
for
people
all
across
the
country
who
have
not
been
affected
now
is
the
time
to
show
the
kind
of
generosity
that
makes
america
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
and
good
place
to
express
that
generosity
is
by
contributing
to
the
red
cross
obviously
you
can
go
on
their
website
the
red
cross
knows
what
they
doing
they
in
close
contact
with
federal
state
and
local
officials
they
will
make
sure
that
we
get
the
resources
to
those
families
as
swiftly
as
possible
and
again
want
to
thank
everybody
here
who
is
doing
such
great
job
when
it
comes
to
the
disaster
response
the
final
message
just
say
is
during
the
darkness
of
the
storm
think
we
also
saw
brightest
in
america
think
all
of
us
obviously
have
been
shocked
by
the
force
of
mother
nature
as
we
watch
it
on
television
at
the
same
time
also
seen
nurses
at
hospital
carrying
fragile
to
safety
seen
incredibly
brave
firefighters
in
queens
in
water
battling
and
rescuing
people
in
boats
one
of
my
stories
is
down
in
north
the
coast
guard
going
out
to
save
sinking
ship
they
sent
rescue
swimmer
out
and
the
rescue
swimmer
said
dan
understand
you
guys
need
that
kind
of
spirit
of
resilience
and
strength
but
most
importantly
looking
out
for
one
another
that
why
we
always
bounce
back
from
these
kinds
of
disasters
this
is
tough
time
for
lot
of
people
millions
of
folks
all
across
the
eastern
seaboard
but
america
is
tougher
and
tougher
because
we
pull
together
we
leave
nobody
behind
we
make
sure
that
we
respond
as
nation
and
remind
ourselves
that
whenever
an
american
is
in
need
all
of
us
stand
together
to
make
sure
that
providing
the
help
that
necessary
so
just
want
to
thank
the
incredible
response
that
already
seen
but
do
want
to
remind
people
this
is
going
to
take
some
time
it
is
not
going
to
be
easy
for
lot
of
these
communities
to
recovery
swiftly
and
so
going
to
be
important
that
we
sustain
that
spirit
of
resilience
that
we
continue
to
be
good
for
the
duration
until
everybody
is
back
on
their
feet
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
red
cross
hello
everybody
just
received
full
briefing
from
our
emergency
response
teams
including
and
agencies
that
are
going
to
be
helpful
in
the
response
and
recovery
efforts
the
department
of
energy
the
department
of
transportation
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
obviously
everybody
is
aware
at
this
point
that
this
is
going
to
be
big
and
powerful
storm
and
all
across
the
eastern
seaboard
think
everybody
is
taking
the
appropriate
preparations
spoken
to
all
the
governors
in
all
these
states
they
have
issues
emergency
declarations
those
have
been
turned
around
quickly
here
in
the
white
house
we
have
assets
so
that
personnel
are
working
closely
with
state
and
local
governments
making
sure
that
food
and
water
and
emergency
generation
is
available
for
those
communities
that
are
going
to
be
hardest
hit
we
anticipate
that
the
of
the
storm
is
going
to
land
fall
sometime
this
evening
but
because
of
the
nature
of
this
storm
we
are
certain
that
this
is
going
to
be
process
through
wide
of
the
country
and
millions
of
people
are
going
to
be
affected
so
the
most
important
message
that
have
for
the
public
right
now
is
please
listen
to
what
your
state
and
local
officials
are
saying
when
they
tell
you
to
evacuate
you
need
to
evacuate
do
not
delay
pause
question
the
instructions
that
are
being
given
because
this
is
serious
storm
and
it
could
potentially
have
fatal
consequence
if
people
acted
quickly
the
good
news
is
is
that
the
governors
and
local
officials
think
have
had
few
days
of
preparation
there
been
extraordinarily
close
coordination
between
state
federal
and
local
governments
and
so
confident
that
the
assets
are
for
an
effective
response
in
the
aftermath
of
the
storm
but
keep
in
mind
that
for
folks
who
are
not
following
instructions
if
you
are
not
evacuating
when
been
asked
to
evacuate
putting
first
responders
at
danger
going
to
have
to
have
teams
in
and
around
multiple
states
all
at
the
same
time
and
although
got
coast
guard
and
the
department
of
all
positioned
if
the
public
is
not
following
instructions
that
makes
it
more
dangerous
for
people
and
it
means
that
we
could
have
fatalities
that
could
have
been
avoided
transportation
is
going
to
be
tied
up
for
long
time
and
probably
the
most
significant
impact
for
lot
of
people
in
addition
to
flooding
is
going
to
be
getting
power
back
on
we
anticipate
that
there
are
going
to
be
lot
of
trees
down
lot
of
water
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
power
companies
are
working
very
closely
with
their
various
state
officials
and
local
officials
to
make
sure
that
they
are
bringing
in
as
many
assets
as
possible
and
getting
those
ready
in
preparation
for
the
storm
the
fact
is
that
lot
of
these
emergency
crews
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
into
position
to
start
restoring
power
until
some
of
these
winds
have
died
down
and
because
of
the
nature
of
this
storm
that
may
take
several
days
so
the
public
should
anticipate
that
going
to
be
lot
of
power
outages
and
it
may
take
time
for
that
power
to
get
back
on
the
same
is
true
with
transportation
there
are
going
to
be
lot
of
backlogs
and
even
after
the
storm
has
cleared
going
to
take
considerable
amount
of
time
for
airlines
subways
trains
and
so
forth
potentially
to
get
back
on
schedule
depending
on
the
amount
of
damage
that
has
occurred
let
me
just
by
saying
that
extraordinarily
grateful
for
the
cooperation
of
our
state
and
local
officials
the
conversations
that
had
with
all
the
governors
indicate
that
at
this
point
there
are
no
unmet
needs
think
everybody
is
taking
this
very
seriously
gotten
all
the
resources
that
we
need
but
right
now
the
key
is
to
make
sure
that
the
public
is
following
instructions
for
those
of
you
who
still
need
additional
information
about
how
to
respond
you
can
go
to
and
that
website
should
provide
you
with
all
the
information
that
your
family
needs
in
terms
of
how
you
can
prepare
for
this
storm
our
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
all
the
people
who
are
potentially
affected
we
are
extraordinarily
grateful
for
our
first
responders
because
going
to
be
working
around
the
clock
and
want
to
make
sure
that
our
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
all
those
who
may
end
up
be
dealing
with
very
difficult
situation
over
the
next
several
days
last
point
make
though
this
is
going
to
be
big
storm
going
to
be
difficult
storm
the
great
thing
about
america
is
when
we
go
through
tough
times
like
this
we
all
pull
together
we
look
out
for
our
friends
we
look
out
for
our
and
we
set
aside
whatever
issues
we
may
have
otherwise
to
make
sure
that
we
respond
appropriately
and
with
swiftness
and
exactly
what
anticipate
is
going
to
happen
here
so
want
to
thank
all
the
federal
teams
state
and
local
teams
that
are
in
place
confident
that
ready
but
think
the
public
needs
to
prepare
for
the
fact
that
this
is
going
to
take
long
time
for
us
to
clean
up
the
good
news
is
we
will
clean
up
and
we
will
get
through
this
what
about
the
impact
on
the
election
sir
president
am
not
worried
at
this
point
about
the
impact
on
the
election
worried
about
the
impact
on
families
and
worried
about
the
impact
on
our
first
responders
worried
about
the
impact
on
our
economy
and
on
transportation
the
election
will
take
care
of
itself
next
week
right
now
our
priority
is
to
make
sure
that
we
are
saving
lives
that
our
teams
are
going
to
be
in
place
that
people
are
going
to
get
the
food
the
water
the
shelter
that
they
need
in
case
of
emergency
and
that
we
respond
as
quickly
as
possible
to
get
the
economy
back
on
track
thank
you
everybody
president
secretary
general
fellow
delegates
ladies
and
gentleman
would
like
to
begin
today
by
telling
you
about
an
american
named
was
born
in
town
called
grass
valley
california
the
son
of
lawyer
and
musician
as
young
man
joined
the
peace
corps
and
taught
english
in
morocco
and
he
came
to
love
and
respect
the
people
of
north
africa
and
the
middle
east
he
would
carry
that
commitment
throughout
his
life
as
diplomat
he
worked
from
egypt
to
syria
from
saudi
arabia
to
libya
he
was
known
for
walking
the
streets
of
the
cities
where
he
worked
tasting
the
local
food
meeting
as
many
people
as
he
could
speaking
arabic
listening
with
broad
smile
went
to
in
the
early
days
of
the
libyan
revolution
arriving
on
cargo
ship
as
representative
he
helped
the
libyan
people
as
they
coped
with
violent
conflict
cared
for
the
wounded
and
crafted
vision
for
the
future
in
which
the
rights
of
all
libyans
would
be
respected
and
after
the
revolution
he
supported
the
birth
of
new
democracy
as
libyans
held
elections
and
built
new
institutions
and
began
to
move
forward
after
decades
of
dictatorship
loved
his
work
he
took
pride
in
the
country
he
served
and
he
saw
dignity
in
the
people
that
he
met
and
two
weeks
ago
he
to
to
review
plans
to
establish
new
cultural
and
hospital
when
compound
came
under
attack
along
with
three
of
his
colleagues
was
killed
in
the
city
that
he
helped
to
save
he
was
years
old
tell
you
this
story
because
embodied
the
best
of
america
like
his
fellow
foreign
service
officers
he
built
bridges
across
oceans
and
cultures
and
was
deeply
invested
in
the
international
cooperation
that
the
united
nations
represents
he
acted
with
humility
but
he
also
stood
up
for
set
of
principles
belief
that
individuals
should
be
free
to
determine
their
own
destiny
and
live
with
liberty
dignity
justice
and
opportunity
the
attacks
on
the
civilians
in
were
attacks
on
america
we
are
grateful
for
the
assistance
we
received
from
the
libyan
government
and
from
the
libyan
people
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
we
will
be
relentless
in
tracking
down
the
killers
and
bringing
them
to
justice
and
also
appreciate
that
in
recent
days
the
leaders
of
other
countries
in
the
region
including
egypt
tunisia
and
yemen
have
taken
steps
to
secure
our
diplomatic
facilities
and
called
for
calm
and
so
have
religious
authorities
around
the
globe
but
understand
the
attacks
of
the
last
two
weeks
are
not
simply
an
assault
on
america
they
are
also
an
assault
on
the
very
ideals
upon
which
the
united
nations
was
founded
the
notion
that
people
can
resolve
their
differences
peacefully
that
diplomacy
can
take
the
place
of
war
that
in
an
interdependent
world
all
of
us
have
stake
in
working
towards
greater
opportunity
and
security
for
our
citizens
if
we
are
serious
about
upholding
these
ideals
it
will
not
be
enough
to
put
more
guards
in
front
of
an
embassy
or
to
put
out
statements
of
regret
and
wait
for
the
outrage
to
pass
if
we
are
serious
about
these
ideals
we
must
speak
honestly
about
the
deeper
causes
of
the
crisis
because
we
face
choice
between
the
forces
that
would
drive
us
apart
and
the
hopes
that
we
hold
in
common
today
we
must
reaffirm
that
our
future
will
be
determined
by
people
like
and
not
by
his
killers
today
we
must
declare
that
this
violence
and
intolerance
has
no
place
among
our
united
nations
it
has
been
less
than
two
years
since
vendor
in
tunisia
set
himself
on
fire
to
protest
the
oppressive
corruption
in
his
country
and
sparked
what
became
known
as
the
arab
spring
and
since
then
the
world
has
been
captivated
by
the
transformation
taken
place
and
the
united
states
has
supported
the
forces
of
change
we
were
inspired
by
the
tunisian
protests
that
toppled
dictator
because
we
our
own
beliefs
in
the
aspiration
of
men
and
women
who
took
to
the
streets
we
insisted
on
change
in
egypt
because
our
support
for
democracy
ultimately
put
us
on
the
side
of
the
people
we
supported
transition
of
leadership
in
yemen
because
the
interests
of
the
people
were
no
longer
being
served
by
corrupt
status
we
intervened
in
libya
alongside
broad
coalition
and
with
the
mandate
of
the
united
nations
security
council
because
we
had
the
ability
to
stop
the
slaughter
of
innocents
and
because
we
believed
that
the
aspirations
of
the
people
were
more
powerful
than
tyrant
and
as
we
meet
here
we
again
declare
that
the
regime
of
must
come
to
an
end
so
that
the
suffering
of
the
syrian
people
can
stop
and
new
dawn
can
begin
we
have
taken
these
positions
because
we
believe
that
freedom
and
are
not
unique
to
one
culture
these
are
not
simply
american
values
or
western
values
they
are
universal
values
and
even
as
there
will
be
huge
challenges
to
come
with
transition
to
democracy
am
convinced
that
ultimately
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
is
more
likely
to
bring
about
the
stability
prosperity
and
individual
opportunity
that
serve
as
basis
for
peace
in
our
world
so
let
us
remember
that
this
is
season
of
progress
for
the
first
time
in
decades
and
libyans
voted
for
new
leaders
in
elections
that
were
credible
competitive
and
fair
this
democratic
spirit
has
not
been
restricted
to
the
arab
world
over
the
past
year
seen
peaceful
transitions
of
power
in
malawi
and
senegal
and
new
president
in
somalia
in
burma
president
has
freed
political
prisoners
and
opened
closed
society
courageous
dissident
has
been
elected
to
parliament
and
people
look
forward
to
further
reform
around
the
globe
people
are
making
their
voices
heard
insisting
on
their
innate
dignity
and
the
right
to
determine
their
future
and
yet
the
turmoil
of
recent
weeks
reminds
us
that
the
path
to
democracy
does
not
end
with
the
casting
of
ballot
mandela
once
said
to
be
free
is
not
merely
to
cast
off
chains
but
to
live
in
way
that
respects
and
enhances
the
freedom
of
others
true
democracy
demands
that
citizens
can
not
be
thrown
in
jail
because
of
what
they
believe
and
that
businesses
can
be
opened
without
paying
bribe
it
depends
on
the
freedom
of
citizens
to
speak
their
minds
and
assemble
without
fear
and
on
the
rule
of
law
and
due
process
that
guarantees
the
rights
of
all
people
in
other
words
true
democracy
real
freedom
is
hard
work
those
in
power
have
to
resist
the
temptation
to
crack
down
on
dissidents
in
hard
economic
times
countries
must
be
tempted
may
be
tempted
to
rally
the
people
around
perceived
enemies
at
home
and
abroad
rather
than
focusing
on
the
painstaking
work
of
reform
moreover
there
will
always
be
those
that
reject
human
progress
dictators
who
cling
to
power
corrupt
interests
that
depend
on
the
status
and
extremists
who
fan
the
flames
of
hate
and
division
from
northern
ireland
to
south
asia
from
africa
to
the
from
the
to
the
pacific
rim
witnessed
convulsions
that
can
accompany
transitions
to
new
political
order
at
time
the
conflicts
arise
along
the
fault
lines
of
race
or
tribe
and
often
they
arise
from
the
difficulties
of
reconciling
tradition
and
faith
with
the
diversity
and
interdependence
of
the
modern
world
in
every
country
there
are
those
who
find
different
religious
beliefs
threatening
in
every
culture
those
who
love
freedom
for
themselves
must
ask
themselves
how
much
willing
to
tolerate
freedom
for
others
that
is
what
we
saw
play
out
in
the
last
two
weeks
as
crude
and
disgusting
video
sparked
outrage
throughout
the
muslim
world
now
have
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
government
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
video
and
believe
its
message
must
be
rejected
by
all
who
respect
our
common
humanity
it
is
an
insult
not
only
to
muslims
but
to
america
as
well
for
as
the
city
outside
these
walls
makes
clear
we
are
country
that
has
welcomed
people
of
every
race
and
every
faith
we
are
home
to
muslims
who
worship
across
our
country
we
not
only
respect
the
freedom
of
religion
we
have
laws
that
protect
individuals
from
being
harmed
because
of
how
they
look
or
what
they
believe
we
understand
why
people
take
to
this
video
because
millions
of
our
citizens
are
among
them
know
there
are
some
who
ask
why
we
just
ban
such
video
and
the
answer
is
enshrined
in
our
laws
our
constitution
protects
the
right
to
practice
free
here
in
the
united
states
countless
publications
provoke
like
me
the
majority
of
americans
are
christian
and
yet
we
do
not
ban
blasphemy
against
our
most
sacred
beliefs
as
president
of
our
country
and
of
our
military
accept
that
people
are
going
to
call
me
awful
things
every
day
and
will
always
defend
their
right
to
do
so
americans
have
fought
and
died
around
the
globe
to
protect
the
right
of
all
people
to
express
their
views
even
views
that
we
profoundly
disagree
with
we
do
not
do
so
because
we
support
hateful
but
because
our
founders
understood
that
without
such
protections
the
capacity
of
each
individual
to
express
their
own
views
and
practice
their
own
faith
may
be
threatened
we
do
so
because
in
diverse
society
efforts
to
restrict
can
quickly
become
tool
to
silence
critics
and
oppress
minorities
we
do
so
because
given
the
power
of
faith
in
our
lives
and
the
passion
that
religious
differences
can
inflame
the
strongest
weapon
against
hateful
is
not
repression
it
is
more
the
voices
of
tolerance
that
rally
against
bigotry
and
blasphemy
and
lift
up
the
values
of
understanding
and
mutual
respect
now
know
that
not
all
countries
in
this
body
share
this
particular
understanding
of
the
protection
of
free
we
that
but
in
at
time
when
anyone
with
cell
phone
can
spread
offensive
views
around
the
world
with
the
click
of
button
the
notion
that
we
can
control
the
flow
of
information
is
obsolete
the
question
then
is
how
do
we
respond
and
on
this
we
must
agree
there
is
no
that
justifies
mindless
violence
there
are
no
words
that
excuse
the
killing
of
innocents
there
no
video
that
justifies
an
attack
on
an
embassy
there
no
slander
that
provides
an
excuse
for
people
to
burn
restaurant
in
lebanon
or
destroy
school
in
or
cause
death
and
destruction
in
pakistan
in
this
modern
world
with
modern
technologies
for
us
to
respond
in
that
way
to
hateful
empowers
any
individual
who
engages
in
such
to
create
chaos
around
the
world
we
empower
the
worst
of
us
if
how
we
respond
more
broadly
the
events
of
the
last
two
weeks
also
speak
to
the
need
for
all
of
us
to
honestly
address
the
tensions
between
the
west
and
the
arab
world
that
is
moving
towards
democracy
now
let
me
be
clear
just
as
we
can
not
solve
every
problem
in
the
world
the
united
states
has
not
and
will
not
seek
to
dictate
the
outcome
of
democratic
transitions
abroad
we
do
not
expect
other
nations
to
agree
with
us
on
every
issue
nor
do
we
assume
that
the
violence
of
the
past
weeks
or
the
hateful
by
some
individuals
represent
the
views
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
muslims
any
more
than
the
views
of
the
people
who
produced
this
video
represents
those
of
americans
however
do
believe
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
all
leaders
in
all
countries
to
speak
out
forcefully
against
violence
and
extremism
it
is
time
to
those
who
even
when
not
directly
resorting
to
violence
use
hatred
of
america
or
the
west
or
israel
as
the
central
principle
of
politics
for
that
only
gives
cover
and
sometimes
makes
an
excuse
for
those
who
do
resort
to
violence
that
brand
of
politics
one
that
pits
east
against
west
and
south
against
north
muslims
against
and
hindu
and
jews
deliver
on
the
promise
of
freedom
to
the
youth
it
offers
only
false
hope
burning
an
american
flag
does
nothing
to
provide
child
an
education
smashing
apart
restaurant
does
not
fill
an
empty
stomach
attacking
an
embassy
create
single
job
that
brand
of
politics
only
makes
it
harder
to
achieve
what
we
must
do
together
educating
our
children
and
creating
the
opportunities
that
they
deserve
protecting
human
rights
and
extending
promise
understand
america
will
never
retreat
from
the
world
we
will
bring
justice
to
those
who
harm
our
citizens
and
our
friends
and
we
will
stand
with
our
allies
we
are
willing
to
partner
with
countries
around
the
world
to
deepen
ties
of
trade
and
investment
and
science
and
technology
energy
and
development
all
efforts
that
can
spark
economic
growth
for
all
our
people
and
democratic
change
but
such
efforts
depend
on
spirit
of
mutual
interest
and
mutual
respect
no
government
or
company
no
school
or
will
be
confident
working
in
country
where
its
people
are
endangered
for
partnerships
to
be
effective
our
citizens
must
be
secure
and
our
efforts
must
be
welcomed
politics
based
only
on
anger
one
based
on
dividing
the
world
between
us
and
them
not
only
sets
back
international
cooperation
it
ultimately
undermines
those
who
tolerate
it
all
of
us
have
an
interest
in
standing
up
to
these
forces
let
us
remember
that
muslims
have
suffered
the
most
at
the
hands
of
extremism
on
the
same
day
our
civilians
were
killed
in
turkish
police
officer
was
murdered
in
istanbul
only
days
before
his
wedding
more
than
were
killed
in
car
bomb
in
several
afghan
children
were
mourned
by
their
parents
just
days
after
they
were
killed
by
suicide
bomber
in
the
impulse
towards
intolerance
and
violence
may
initially
be
focused
on
the
west
but
over
time
it
can
not
be
contained
the
same
impulses
toward
extremism
are
used
to
justify
war
between
and
between
tribes
and
clans
it
leads
not
to
strength
and
prosperity
but
to
chaos
in
less
than
two
years
we
have
seen
largely
peaceful
protests
bring
more
change
to
countries
than
decade
of
violence
and
extremists
understand
this
because
they
have
nothing
to
offer
to
improve
the
lives
of
people
violence
is
their
only
way
to
stay
relevant
they
build
they
only
destroy
it
is
time
to
leave
the
call
of
violence
and
the
politics
of
division
behind
on
so
many
issues
we
face
choice
between
the
promise
of
the
future
or
the
prisons
of
the
past
and
we
can
not
afford
to
get
it
wrong
we
must
seize
this
moment
and
america
stands
ready
to
work
with
all
who
are
willing
to
embrace
better
future
the
future
must
not
belong
to
those
who
target
in
egypt
it
must
be
claimed
by
those
in
square
who
chanted
muslims
we
are
one
the
future
must
not
belong
to
those
who
bully
women
it
must
be
shaped
by
girls
who
go
to
school
and
those
who
stand
for
world
where
our
daughters
can
live
their
dreams
just
like
our
sons
the
future
must
not
belong
to
those
corrupt
few
who
steal
resources
it
must
be
won
by
the
students
and
entrepreneurs
the
workers
and
business
owners
who
seek
broader
prosperity
for
all
people
those
are
the
women
and
men
that
america
stands
with
theirs
is
the
vision
we
will
support
the
future
must
not
belong
to
those
who
slander
the
prophet
of
islam
but
to
be
credible
those
who
condemn
that
slander
must
also
condemn
the
hate
we
see
in
the
images
of
jesus
christ
that
are
desecrated
or
churches
that
are
destroyed
or
the
holocaust
that
is
denied
let
us
condemn
incitement
against
muslims
and
pilgrims
time
to
heed
the
words
of
gandhi
intolerance
is
itself
form
of
violence
and
an
obstacle
to
the
growth
of
true
democratic
spirit
together
we
must
work
towards
world
where
we
are
strengthened
by
our
differences
and
not
defined
by
them
that
is
what
america
embodies
the
vision
we
will
support
among
israelis
and
the
future
must
not
belong
to
those
who
turn
their
backs
on
prospect
of
peace
let
us
leave
behind
those
who
thrive
on
conflict
those
who
reject
the
right
of
israel
to
exist
the
road
is
hard
but
the
destination
is
clear
secure
jewish
state
of
israel
and
an
independent
prosperous
understanding
that
such
peace
must
come
through
just
agreement
between
the
parties
america
will
walk
alongside
all
who
are
prepared
to
make
that
journey
in
syria
the
future
must
not
belong
to
dictator
who
massacres
his
people
if
there
is
cause
that
cries
out
for
protest
in
the
world
today
peaceful
protest
it
is
regime
that
tortures
children
and
shoots
rockets
at
apartment
buildings
and
we
must
remain
engaged
to
assure
that
what
began
with
citizens
demanding
their
rights
does
not
end
in
cycle
of
sectarian
violence
together
we
must
stand
with
those
who
believe
in
different
vision
syria
that
is
united
and
inclusive
where
children
need
to
fear
their
own
government
and
all
have
say
in
how
they
are
governed
and
and
what
america
stands
for
that
is
the
outcome
that
we
will
work
for
with
sanctions
and
consequences
for
those
who
persecute
and
assistance
and
support
for
those
who
work
for
this
common
good
because
we
believe
that
the
who
embrace
this
vision
will
have
the
strength
and
the
legitimacy
to
lead
in
iran
we
see
where
the
path
of
violent
and
unaccountable
ideology
leads
the
iranian
people
have
remarkable
and
ancient
history
and
many
iranians
wish
to
enjoy
peace
and
prosperity
alongside
their
but
just
as
it
restricts
the
rights
of
its
own
people
the
iranian
government
continues
to
prop
up
dictator
in
damascus
and
supports
terrorist
groups
abroad
time
and
again
it
has
failed
to
take
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
its
nuclear
program
is
peaceful
and
to
meet
its
obligations
to
the
united
nations
so
let
me
be
clear
america
wants
to
resolve
this
issue
through
diplomacy
and
we
believe
that
there
is
still
time
and
space
to
do
so
but
that
time
is
not
unlimited
we
respect
the
right
of
nations
to
access
peaceful
nuclear
power
but
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
united
nations
is
to
see
that
we
harness
that
power
for
peace
and
make
no
mistake
iran
is
not
challenge
that
can
be
contained
it
would
threaten
the
elimination
of
israel
the
security
of
gulf
nations
and
the
stability
of
the
global
economy
it
risks
triggering
race
in
the
region
and
the
of
the
treaty
why
coalition
of
countries
is
holding
the
iranian
government
accountable
and
why
the
united
states
will
do
what
we
must
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapon
we
know
from
painful
experience
that
the
path
to
security
and
prosperity
does
not
lie
outside
the
boundaries
of
international
law
and
respect
for
human
rights
why
this
institution
was
established
from
the
rubble
of
conflict
that
is
why
liberty
triumphed
over
tyranny
in
the
cold
war
and
that
is
the
lesson
of
the
last
two
decades
as
well
history
shows
that
peace
and
progress
come
to
those
who
make
the
right
choices
nations
in
every
part
of
the
world
have
this
difficult
path
europe
the
bloodiest
battlefield
of
the
century
is
united
free
and
at
peace
from
brazil
to
south
africa
from
turkey
to
south
korea
from
india
to
people
of
different
races
religions
and
traditions
have
lifted
millions
out
of
poverty
while
respecting
the
rights
of
their
citizens
and
meeting
their
responsibilities
as
nations
and
it
is
because
of
the
progress
that
witnessed
in
my
own
lifetime
the
progress
that
witnessed
after
nearly
four
years
as
president
that
remain
ever
hopeful
about
the
world
that
we
live
in
the
war
in
iraq
is
over
american
troops
have
come
home
begun
transition
in
and
america
and
our
allies
will
end
our
war
on
schedule
in
has
been
weakened
and
bin
laden
is
no
more
nations
have
come
together
to
lock
down
nuclear
materials
and
america
and
russia
are
reducing
our
arsenals
we
have
seen
hard
choices
made
from
to
cairo
to
abidjan
to
put
more
power
in
the
hands
of
citizens
at
time
of
economic
challenge
the
world
has
come
together
to
broaden
prosperity
through
the
we
have
partnered
with
emerging
countries
to
keep
the
world
on
the
path
of
recovery
america
has
pursued
development
agenda
that
fuels
growth
and
breaks
dependency
and
worked
with
african
leaders
to
help
them
feed
their
nations
new
partnerships
have
been
forged
to
combat
corruption
and
promote
government
that
is
open
and
transparent
and
new
commitments
have
been
made
through
the
equal
futures
partnership
to
ensure
that
women
and
girls
can
fully
participate
in
politics
and
pursue
opportunity
and
later
today
will
discuss
our
efforts
to
combat
the
scourge
of
human
trafficking
all
these
things
give
me
hope
but
what
gives
me
the
most
hope
is
not
the
actions
of
us
not
the
actions
of
leaders
it
is
the
people
that
seen
the
american
troops
who
have
risked
their
lives
and
sacrificed
their
limbs
for
strangers
half
world
away
the
students
in
jakarta
or
seoul
who
are
eager
to
use
their
knowledge
to
benefit
mankind
the
faces
in
square
in
prague
or
parliament
in
ghana
who
see
democracy
giving
voice
to
their
aspirations
the
young
people
in
the
of
and
the
schools
of
whose
eyes
shine
with
promise
these
men
women
and
children
of
every
race
and
every
faith
remind
me
that
for
every
angry
mob
that
gets
shown
on
television
there
are
billions
around
the
world
who
share
similar
hopes
and
dreams
they
tell
us
that
there
is
common
heartbeat
to
humanity
so
much
attention
in
our
world
turns
to
what
divides
us
what
we
see
on
the
news
that
what
consumes
our
political
debates
but
when
you
strip
it
all
away
people
everywhere
long
for
the
freedom
to
determine
their
destiny
the
dignity
that
comes
with
work
the
comfort
that
comes
with
faith
and
the
justice
that
exists
when
governments
serve
their
people
and
not
the
other
way
around
the
united
states
of
america
will
always
stand
up
for
these
aspirations
for
our
own
people
and
for
people
all
across
the
world
that
was
our
founding
purpose
that
is
what
our
history
shows
that
is
what
worked
for
throughout
his
life
and
promise
you
this

the
tens
of
thousands
who
marched
against
violence
through
the
streets
of
in
the
libyans
who
changed
their
photo
to
one
of

the
signs
that

friend

all
libyans
they

us
hope

as
we

thank
you
very
much
well
good
afternoon
everybody
and
president
thank
you
for
your
very
kind
introduction
although
have
to
admit
really
did
like
the
few
weeks
ago
little
bit
better
afterwards
somebody
that
somebody
needs
to
make
him
secretary
of
explaining
things
although
they
use
the
word
things
president
you
are
tireless
passionate
advocate
on
behalf
of
what
best
in
our
country
you
have
helped
to
improve
and
save
the
lives
of
millions
of
people
around
the
world
am
grateful
for
your
friendship
and
your
extraordinary
leadership
and
think
speak
for
the
entire
country
when
we
say
that
you
continue
to
be
great
treasure
for
all
of
us
as
always
also
have
to
thank
president
for
being
so
understanding
with
the
number
of
countries
visited
by
our
secretary
of
state
as
seen
again
in
recent
days
is
leader
of
grace
and
grit
and
believe
she
will
go
down
as
one
of
the
finest
secretaries
of
state
in
american
history
so
we
are
grateful
to
her
to
the
dedicated
staff
and
every
that
made
commitments
and
touched
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
thank
you
for
being
an
example
of
what
we
need
more
of
in
the
world
especially
in
washington
working
together
to
actually
solve
problems
and
why
here
as
bill
mentioned
come
to
every
year
that
been
president
and
talked
with
you
about
how
we
need
to
sustain
the
economic
recovery
how
we
need
to
create
more
jobs
talked
about
the
importance
of
development
from
global
health
to
our
fight
against
to
the
growth
that
lifts
nations
to
prosperity
we
talked
about
development
and
how
it
has
to
include
women
and
girls
because
by
every
benchmark
nations
that
educate
their
women
and
girls
end
up
being
more
successful
and
today
want
to
discuss
an
issue
that
relates
to
each
of
these
challenges
it
ought
to
concern
every
person
because
it
is
debasement
of
our
common
humanity
it
ought
to
concern
every
community
because
it
tears
at
our
social
fabric
it
ought
to
concern
every
business
because
it
distorts
markets
it
ought
to
concern
every
nation
because
it
endangers
public
health
and
fuels
violence
and
crime
talking
about
the
injustice
the
outrage
of
human
trafficking
which
must
be
called
by
its
true
name
modern
slavery
now
do
not
use
that
word
slavery
lightly
it
evokes
obviously
one
of
the
most
painful
chapters
in
our
history
but
around
the
world
no
denying
the
awful
reality
when
man
desperate
for
work
finds
himself
in
factory
or
on
fishing
boat
or
in
field
working
toiling
for
little
or
no
pay
and
beaten
if
he
tries
to
escape
that
is
slavery
when
woman
is
locked
in
sweatshop
or
trapped
in
home
as
domestic
servant
alone
and
abused
and
incapable
of
leaving
slavery
when
little
boy
is
kidnapped
turned
into
child
soldier
forced
to
kill
or
be
killed
slavery
when
little
girl
is
sold
by
her
impoverished
family
girls
my
age
runs
away
from
home
or
is
lured
by
the
false
promises
of
better
life
and
then
imprisoned
in
brothel
and
tortured
if
she
resists
slavery
it
is
barbaric
and
it
is
evil
and
it
has
no
place
in
world
now
as
nation
long
rejected
such
cruelty
just
few
days
ago
we
marked
the
anniversary
of
document
that
have
hanging
in
the
oval
office
the
emancipation
proclamation
with
the
advance
of
union
forces
it
brought
new
day
that
all
persons
held
as
slaves
would
thenceforth
be
forever
free
we
wrote
that
promise
into
our
constitution
we
spent
decades
struggling
to
make
it
real
we
joined
with
other
nations
in
the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
so
that
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
shall
be
prohibited
in
all
their
forms
global
movement
was
sparked
with
the
trafficking
victims
protection
act
signed
by
president
and
carried
on
by
president
bush
and
here
at
made
impressive
commitments
in
this
fight
we
are
especially
to
be
joined
today
by
advocates
who
dedicate
their
lives
and
at
times
risk
their
lives
to
liberate
victims
and
help
them
recover
this
includes
men
and
women
of
faith
who
like
the
great
abolitionists
before
them
are
truly
doing
the
work
evangelicals
the
catholic
church
international
justice
mission
and
world
relief
even
individual
congregations
like
passion
city
church
in
atlanta
and
so
many
young
people
of
faith
who
decided
that
their
conscience
compels
them
to
act
in
the
face
of
injustice
groups
like
these
are
answering
the
call
to
seek
justice
and
rescue
the
oppressed
some
of
them
join
us
today
and
we
are
grateful
for
your
leadership
now
as
president
made
it
clear
that
the
united
states
will
continue
to
be
leader
in
this
global
movement
got
comprehensive
strategy
shining
spotlight
on
the
dark
corners
where
it
persists
under
leadership
doing
more
than
ever
with
our
annual
trafficking
report
with
new
outreach
and
partnerships
to
give
countries
incentives
to
meet
their
responsibilities
and
calling
them
out
when
they
recently
renewed
sanctions
on
some
of
the
worst
abusers
including
north
korea
and
eritrea
partnering
with
groups
that
help
women
and
children
escape
from
the
grip
of
their
abusers
helping
other
countries
step
up
their
own
efforts
and
seeing
results
more
nations
have
passed
and
more
are
enforcing
modern
laws
last
week
was
proud
to
welcome
to
the
oval
office
not
only
great
champion
of
democracy
but
fierce
advocate
against
the
use
of
forced
and
child
soldiers
san
and
as
part
of
our
engagement
encourage
burma
to
keep
taking
steps
to
reform
because
nations
must
speak
with
one
voice
our
people
and
our
children
are
not
for
sale
but
for
all
the
progress
that
made
the
bitter
truth
is
that
trafficking
also
goes
on
right
here
in
the
united
states
the
migrant
worker
unable
to
pay
off
the
debt
to
his
trafficker
the
man
lured
here
with
the
promise
of
job
his
documents
then
taken
and
forced
to
work
endless
hours
in
kitchen
the
teenage
girl
beaten
forced
to
walk
the
streets
this
should
not
be
happening
in
the
united
states
of
america
as
president
directed
my
administration
to
step
up
our
efforts
and
we
have
for
the
first
time
at
direction
our
annual
trafficking
report
now
includes
the
united
states
because
we
ask
other
nations
to
do
what
we
are
not
doing
ourselves
expanded
our
task
force
to
include
more
federal
partners
including
the
the
intelligence
community
is
devoting
more
resources
to
identifying
trafficking
networks
strengthened
protections
so
that
workers
know
their
rights
and
most
of
all
going
after
the
traffickers
new
teams
are
dismantling
their
networks
last
year
we
charged
record
number
of
these
predators
with
human
trafficking
putting
them
where
they
belong
behind
bars
but
with
more
than
million
victims
of
human
trafficking
around
the
world
think
about
that
more
than
million
got
lot
more
to
do
and
why
earlier
this
year
directed
my
administration
to
increase
our
efforts
and
today
can
announce
series
of
additional
steps
that
going
to
take
first
going
to
do
more
to
spot
it
and
stop
it
prepare
new
assessment
of
human
trafficking
in
the
united
states
so
we
better
understand
the
scope
and
scale
of
the
problem
strengthen
training
so
investigators
and
law
enforcement
are
even
better
equipped
to
take
action
and
treat
victims
as
victims
not
as
criminals
applause
going
to
work
with
and
bus
and
truck
inspectors
so
that
on
the
lookout
help
teachers
and
educators
spot
the
signs
as
well
and
better
serve
those
who
are
vulnerable
especially
our
young
people
second
turning
the
tables
on
the
traffickers
just
as
they
are
now
using
technology
and
the
internet
to
exploit
their
victims
going
to
harness
technology
to
stop
them
encouraging
tech
companies
and
advocates
and
law
enforcement
and
also
challenging
college
students
to
develop
tools
that
our
young
people
can
use
to
stay
safe
and
on
their
smart
phones
third
do
even
more
to
help
victims
recover
and
rebuild
their
lives
develop
new
action
plan
to
improve
coordination
across
the
federal
government
increasing
access
to
services
to
help
survivors
become
working
to
simplify
visa
procedures
for
visas
so
that
innocent
victims
from
other
countries
can
stay
here
as
they
help
us
prosecute
their
traffickers
this
coming
year
my
office
of
and
partnerships
will
make
the
fight
against
human
trafficking
focus
of
its
work
doing
great
work
and
also
proud
to
announce
new
partnership
with
humanity
united
which
is
leader
in
dollar
challenge
to
local
communities
to
find
new
ways
to
care
for
trafficking
victims
and
want
to
thank
university
which
will
be
focusing
on
how
to
best
care
for
child
victims
now
finally
as
one
of
the
largest
purchasers
of
goods
and
services
in
the
world
the
united
states
government
will
lead
by
example
already
taken
steps
to
make
sure
our
contractors
do
not
engage
in
forced
and
today
going
to
go
further
signed
new
executive
order
that
raises
the
bar
specific
about
the
prohibitions
it
does
more
to
protect
workers
it
ensures
stronger
compliance
in
short
making
clear
that
american
tax
dollars
must
never
ever
be
used
to
support
the
trafficking
of
human
beings
we
will
have
zero
tolerance
we
mean
what
we
say
we
will
enforce
it
of
course
no
government
no
nation
can
meet
this
challenge
alone
everybody
has
responsibility
every
nation
can
take
action
modern
laws
must
be
passed
and
enforced
and
justice
systems
must
be
strengthened
victims
must
be
cared
for
so
here
in
the
united
states
congress
should
renew
the
trafficking
victims
protection
act
whether
you
are
conservative
or
liberal
democrat
or
republican
this
is
this
is
something
we
should
all
agree
on
we
need
to
get
that
done
and
more
broadly
as
nations
to
addressing
the
underlying
forces
that
push
so
many
into
bondage
in
the
first
place
with
development
and
economic
growth
that
creates
legitimate
jobs
less
likelihood
of
servitude
around
the
globe
sense
of
justice
that
says
no
child
should
ever
be
exploited
that
has
to
be
burned
into
the
cultures
of
every
country
commitment
to
equality
as
in
the
equal
futures
partnership
that
we
launched
with
other
nations
yesterday
so
societies
empower
our
sisters
and
our
daughters
just
as
much
as
our
brothers
and
sons
and
every
business
can
take
action
all
the
business
leaders
who
are
here
and
our
global
economy
companies
have
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
their
supply
chains
stretching
into
the
far
corners
of
the
globe
are
free
of
forced
the
good
news
is
more
and
more
responsible
companies
are
holding
themselves
to
higher
standards
and
today
want
to
salute
the
new
commitments
that
are
being
made
that
includes
the
new
global
business
coalition
against
trafficking
companies
that
are
sending
message
human
trafficking
is
not
business
model
it
is
crime
and
we
are
going
to
stop
it
proud
of
them
every
faith
community
can
take
action
as
well
by
educating
their
congregations
by
joining
in
coalitions
that
are
bound
by
love
of
god
and
concern
for
the
oppressed
and
like
that
good
on
the
road
to
jericho
we
just
pass
by
indifferent
got
to
be
moved
by
compassion
got
to
bind
up
the
wounds
come
together
around
simple
truth
that
we
are
our
keepers
and
we
are
our
keepers
and
finally
every
citizen
can
take
action
by
learning
more
by
going
to
the
website
that
we
helped
create
by
speaking
up
and
insisting
that
the
clothes
we
wear
the
food
we
eat
the
products
we
buy
are
made
free
of
forced
by
standing
up
against
the
degradation
and
abuse
of
women
how
real
change
happens
from
the
bottom
up
and
if
you
doubt
that
ask
from
the
congo
think
about
story
she
was
kidnapped
by
rebels
turned
into
slave
she
was
abused
physically
and
sexually
they
got
her
pregnant
five
times
in
one
awful
battle
her
children
were
killed
all
five
of
them
miraculously
she
survived
and
escaped
and
with
care
and
support
she
began
to
heal
and
she
learned
to
read
and
write
and
sew
and
today
is
back
home
working
toward
new
future
or
ask
she
grew
up
in
and
at
was
given
the
opportunity
to
work
as
nanny
here
in
the
united
states
but
when
she
arrived
it
turned
out
to
be
nightmare
cooking
cleaning
days
seven
days
week
one
beating
was
so
bad
it
sent
her
to
the
emergency
room
and
finally
she
escaped
and
with
the
help
from
group
that
cared
today
has
stable
job
an
advocate
even
testified
before
congress
or
ask
white
who
grew
up
in
the
fleeing
an
abusive
home
she
fell
in
with
guy
who
said
protect
her
instead
he
sold
her
just
years
old
to
men
who
raped
her
and
beat
her
and
burned
her
with
irons
and
finally
after
years
with
the
help
of
led
by
other
survivors
she
found
the
courage
to
break
free
and
get
the
services
she
needed
earned
her
today
she
is
powerful
fierce
advocate
who
helped
to
pass
new
law
right
here
in
new
york
these
women
endured
unspeakable
horror
but
in
their
unbreakable
will
in
their
courage
in
their
resilience
they
remind
us
that
this
cycle
can
be
broken
victims
can
become
not
only
survivors
they
can
become
leaders
and
advocates
and
bring
about
change
and
just
met
and

several
of
their
fellow
advocates

are
an
incredible
inspiration

of
us

and
and
each
of
you
in
the
darkest
hours
of
your
lives
you
may
have
felt
utterly
alone
and
it
seemed
like
nobody
cared
and
the
important
thing
for
us
to
understand
is
there
are
millions
around
the
world
who
are
feeling
that
same
way
at
this
very
moment
right
now

is
man
on
boat
casting
the
net
with
his
bleeding
hands
knowing
he
deserves
better
life

of
dignity
but
know
if
anybody
is
paying
attention
right
now
woman
hunched
over
sewing
machine
glancing
beyond
the
bars
on
the
window
knowing
if
just
given
the
chance
she
might
some
day
sell
her
own
wares
but
she
think
anybody
is
paying
attention
right
now
young
boy
in
brick
factory
covered
in
dust
hauling
his
heavy
load
under
blazing
sun
thinking
if
he
could
just
go
to
school
he
might
know
different
future
but
he
think
anybody
is
paying
attention
right
now
there
is
girl
somewhere
trapped
in
brothel
crying
herself
to
sleep
again
and
maybe
daring
to
imagine
that
some
day
just
maybe
she
might
be
treated
not
like
piece
of
property
but
as
human
being
and
so
our
message
today
to
them
is
to
the
millions
around
the
world

see
you
we
hear
you
we
insist
on
your
dignity

we

to
your
talents

dreams

continue
to
lead
it
in
partnership
with
you

movements
of
the
past

that
every
life

in
the
words

devoted
years
of
his
life
to
the
seals
the
consummate
quiet
professional
at
the
salty
frog
bar
they
might
not
have
known
but
also
served
in
iraq
and
and
there
in
he
was
far
from
and
hunter
and
little
and
he
laid
down
his
life
as
he
would
have
for
them
protecting
his
friends
and
today
is
home
smith
it
seems
lived
to
serve
first
in
the
air
force
then
with
you
at
the
state
department
he
knew
the
perils
of
this
calling
from
his
time
in
baghdad
and
there
in
far
from
home
he
surely
thought
of
heather
and
and
and
he
laid
down
his
life
in
service
to
us
all
today
is
home
was
everything
america
could
want
in
an
ambassador
as
the
whole
country
has
come
to
see
how
he
first
went
to
the
region
as
young
man
in
the
peace
corps
how
during
the
revolution
he
arrived
in
libya
on
that
cargo
ship
how
he
believed
in
libya
and
its
people
and
how
they
loved
him
back
and
there
in
he
laid
down
his
life
for
his
friends
libyan
and
american
and
for
us
all
today
is
home
four
americans
four
patriots
they
loved
this
country
and
they
chose
to
serve
it
and
served
it
well
they
had
mission
and
they
believed
in
it
they
knew
the
danger
and
they
accepted
it
they
simply
embrace
the
american
ideal
they
lived
it
they
embodied
it
the
courage
the
hope
and
yes
the
idealism
that
fundamental
american
belief
that
we
can
leave
this
world
little
better
than
before
who
they
were
and
who
we
are
and
if
we
want
to
truly
their
memory
who
we
must
always
be
know
that
this
awful
loss
the
terrible
images
of
recent
days
the
pictures
seeing
again
today
have
caused
some
to
question
this
work
and
there
is
no
doubt
these
are
difficult
days
in
moments
such
as
this
so
much
anger
and
violence
even
the
most
hopeful
among
us
must
wonder
but
amid
all
of
the
images
of
this
week
also
think
of
the
libyans
who
took
to
the
streets
with
homemade
signs
expressing
their
gratitude
to
an
american
who
believed
in
what
we
could
achieve
together
think
of
the
man
in
with
his
sign
in
english
message
he
wanted
all
of
us
to
hear
that
said
was
friend
to
all
libyans
was
friend
the
message
these
four
patriots
sent
the
message
that
each
of
you
sends
every
day
civilians
military
to
people
in
every
corner
of
the
world
that
america
is
friend
and
that
we
care
not
just
about
our
own
country
not
just
about
our
own
interests
but
about
theirs
that
even
as
voices
of
suspicion
and
mistrust
seek
to
divide
countries
and
cultures
from
one
another
the
united
states
of
america
will
never
retreat
from
the
world
we
will
never
stop
working
for
the
dignity
and
freedom
that
every
person
deserves
whatever
their
creed
whatever
their
faith
the
essence
of
american
leadership
the
spirit
that
sets
us
apart
from
other
nations
this
was
their
work
in
and
this
is
the
work
we
will
carry
on
to
you
their
families
and
colleagues
to
all
americans
know
this
their
sacrifice
will
never
be
forgotten
we
will
bring
to
justice
those
who
took
them
from
us
we
will
stand
fast
against
the
violence
on
our
diplomatic
missions
we
will
continue
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
protect
americans
serving
overseas
whether
that
means
increasing
security
at
our
diplomatic
posts
working
with
host
countries
which
have
an
obligation
to
provide
security
and
making
it
clear
that
justice
will
come
to
those
who
harm
americans
most
of
all
even
in
our
grief
we
will
be
resolute
for
we
are
americans
and
we
hold
our
head
high
knowing
that
because
of
these
patriots
because
of
you
this
country
that
we
love
will
always
shine
as
light
unto
the
world
greater
love
no
man
than
this
that
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
the
flag
they
served
under
now
carries
them
home
may
god
bless
the
memory
of
these
men
who
laid
down
their
lives
for
us
all
may
god
watch
over
your
families
and
all
who
loved
them
and
may
god
bless
these
united
states
of
america
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
everybody
thank
you
love
you
so
much
few
nights
ago
everybody
was
reminded
just
what
lucky
man
am
the
other
night
think
the
entire
country
saw
just
how
lucky
am
and
we
are
so
proud
of
you
and
yes
you
do
have
to
go
to
school
in
the
morning
and
thank
you
for
being
the
very
best
vice
president
could
have
ever
hoped
for
and
being
strong
and
loyal
friend
madam
chairwoman
delegates
accept
your
nomination
for
president
of
the
united
states
now
the
first
time
addressed
this
convention
in
was
younger
man
senate
candidate
from
illinois
who
spoke
about
hope
not
blind
optimism
not
wishful
thinking
but
hope
in
the
face
of
difficulty
hope
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
that
dogged
faith
in
the
future
which
has
pushed
this
nation
forward
even
when
the
odds
are
great
even
when
the
road
is
long
eight
years
later
that
hope
has
been
tested
by
the
cost
of
war
by
one
of
the
worst
economic
crises
in
history
and
by
political
gridlock
left
us
wondering
whether
still
even
possible
to
tackle
the
challenges
of
our
time
know
campaigns
can
seem
small
even
silly
sometimes
trivial
things
become
big
distractions
serious
issues
become
sound
bites
the
truth
gets
buried
under
an
avalanche
of
money
and
advertising
if
sick
of
hearing
me
approve
this
message
believe
me
so
am
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
when
you
pick
up
that
ballot
to
vote
you
will
face
the
clearest
choice
of
any
time
in
generation
over
the
next
few
years
big
decisions
will
be
made
in
washington
on
jobs
the
economy
taxes
and
deficits
energy
education
war
and
peace
decisions
that
will
have
huge
impact
on
our
lives
and
our
lives
for
decades
to
come
and
on
every
issue
the
choice
you
face
just
be
between
two
candidates
or
two
parties
it
will
be
choice
between
two
different
paths
for
america
choice
between
two
fundamentally
different
visions
for
the
future
ours
is
fight
to
restore
the
values
that
built
the
largest
middle
class
and
the
strongest
economy
the
world
has
ever
known
the
values
my
grandfather
defended
as
soldier
in
army
the
values
that
drove
my
grandmother
to
work
on
bomber
assembly
line
while
he
was
gone
they
knew
they
were
part
of
something
larger
nation
that
triumphed
over
fascism
and
depression
nation
where
the
most
innovative
businesses
turned
out
the
best
products
and
everyone
shared
in
that
pride
and
success
from
the
corner
office
to
the
factory
floor
my
grandparents
were
given
the
chance
to
go
to
college
buy
their
own
their
own
home
and
the
basic
bargain
at
the
heart
of
story
the
promise
that
hard
work
will
pay
off
that
responsibility
will
be
rewarded
that
everyone
gets
fair
shot
and
everyone
does
their
fair
share
and
everyone
plays
by
the
same
rules
from
main
street
to
wall
street
to
washington
and
ran
for
president
because
saw
that
basic
bargain
slipping
away
began
my
career
helping
people
in
the
shadow
of
shuttered
steel
mill
at
time
when
too
many
good
jobs
were
starting
to
move
overseas
and
by
we
had
seen
nearly
decade
in
which
families
struggled
with
costs
that
kept
rising
but
that
folks
racking
up
more
and
more
debt
just
to
make
the
mortgage
or
pay
tuition
put
gas
in
the
car
or
food
on
the
table
and
when
the
house
of
cards
collapsed
in
the
great
recession
millions
of
innocent
americans
lost
their
jobs
their
homes
their
life
savings
tragedy
from
which
we
still
fighting
to
recover
now
our
friends
down
in
at
the
republican
convention
were
more
than
happy
to
talk
about
everything
they
think
is
wrong
with
america
but
they
have
much
to
say
about
how
make
it
right
they
want
your
vote
but
they
want
you
to
know
their
plan
and
because
all
they
have
to
offer
is
the
same
prescriptions
had
for
the
last
years
have
surplus
try
tax
cut
deficit
too
high
try
another
feel
cold
coming
on
take
two
tax
cuts
roll
back
some
regulations
and
call
us
in
the
morning
now
cut
taxes
for
those
who
need
it
families
small
businesses
but
believe
that
another
round
of
tax
breaks
for
millionaires
will
bring
good
jobs
to
our
shores
or
pay
down
our
deficit
believe
that
firing
teachers
or
kicking
students
off
financial
aid
will
grow
the
economy
or
help
us
compete
with
the
scientists
and
engineers
coming
out
of
china
after
all
been
through
believe
that
rolling
back
regulations
on
wall
street
will
help
the
small
businesswoman
expand
or
the
construction
worker
keep
his
home
we
have
been
there
tried
that
and
not
going
back
we
are
moving
forward
america
now
pretend
the
path
offering
is
quick
or
easy
never
have
you
did
elect
me
to
tell
you
what
you
wanted
to
hear
you
elected
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
and
the
truth
is
it
will
take
more
than
few
years
for
us
to
solve
challenges
that
have
built
up
over
decades
it
require
common
effort
shared
responsibility
and
the
kind
of
bold
persistent
experimentation
that
pursued
during
the
only
crisis
worse
than
this
one
and
by
the
way
those
of
us
who
carry
on
his
party
legacy
should
remember
that
not
every
problem
can
be
remedied
with
another
government
program
or
dictate
from
washington
but
know
this
america
our
problems
can
be
solved
our
challenges
can
be
met
the
path
we
offer
may
be
harder
but
it
leads
to
better
place
and
asking
you
to
choose
that
future
asking
you
to
rally
around
set
of
goals
for
your
country
goals
in
manufacturing
energy
education
national
security
and
the
deficit
real
achievable
plans
that
will
lead
to
new
jobs
more
opportunity
and
rebuild
this
economy
on
stronger
foundation
that
what
we
can
do
in
the
next
four
years
and
that
is
why
am
running
for
second
term
as
president
of
the
united
states
we
can
choose
future
where
we
export
more
products
and
fewer
jobs
after
decade
that
was
defined
by
what
we
bought
and
borrowed
we
getting
back
to
basics
and
doing
what
america
always
done
best
we
are
making
things
again
met
workers
in
detroit
and
toledo
who
feared
they
never
build
another
american
car
and
today
they
build
them
fast
enough
because
we
reinvented
dying
auto
industry
that
back
on
the
top
of
the
world
worked
with
business
leaders
who
are
bringing
jobs
back
to
america
not
because
our
workers
make
less
pay
but
because
we
make
better
products
because
we
work
harder
and
smarter
than
anyone
else
signed
trade
agreements
that
are
helping
our
companies
sell
more
goods
to
millions
of
new
customers
goods
that
are
stamped
with
three
proud
words
made
in
america
and
after
decade
of
decline
this
country
created
over
half
million
manufacturing
jobs
in
the
last
years
and
now
you
have
choice
we
can
give
more
tax
breaks
to
corporations
that
shift
jobs
overseas
or
we
can
start
rewarding
companies
that
open
new
plants
and
train
new
workers
and
create
new
jobs
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
can
help
big
factories
and
small
businesses
double
their
exports
and
if
we
choose
this
path
we
can
create
million
new
manufacturing
jobs
in
the
next
four
years
you
can
make
that
happen
you
can
choose
that
future
you
can
choose
the
path
where
we
control
more
of
our
own
energy
after
years
of
inaction
we
raised
fuel
standards
so
that
by
the
middle
of
the
next
decade
cars
and
trucks
will
go
twice
as
far
on
gallon
of
gas
we
have
doubled
our
use
of
renewable
energy
and
thousands
of
americans
have
jobs
today
building
wind
turbines
and
batteries
in
the
last
year
alone
we
cut
oil
imports
by
one
million
barrels
day
more
than
any
administration
in
recent
history
and
today
the
united
states
of
america
is
less
dependent
on
foreign
oil
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
two
decades
so
now
you
have
choice
between
strategy
that
reverses
this
progress
or
one
that
builds
on
it
we
opened
millions
of
new
acres
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
in
the
last
three
years
and
we
open
more
but
unlike
my
opponent
will
not
let
oil
companies
write
this
country
energy
plan
or
endanger
our
coastlines
or
collect
another
four
billion
dollars
in
corporate
welfare
from
our
taxpayers
we
offering
better
path
we
offering
better
path
where
we
future
where
we
keep
investing
in
wind
and
solar
and
clean
coal
where
farmers
and
scientists
harness
new
to
power
our
cars
and
trucks
where
construction
workers
build
homes
and
factories
that
waste
less
energy
where
where
we
develop
supply
of
natural
gas
that
right
beneath
our
feet
if
you
choose
this
path
we
can
cut
our
oil
imports
in
half
by
and
support
more
than
new
jobs
in
natural
gas
alone
and
yes
my
plan
will
continue
to
reduce
the
carbon
pollution
that
is
heating
our
planet
because
climate
change
is
not
hoax
more
droughts
and
floods
and
wildfires
are
not
joke
they
are
threat
to
our
children
future
and
in
this
election
you
can
do
something
about
it
you
can
choose
future
where
more
americans
have
the
chance
to
gain
the
skills
they
need
to
compete
no
matter
how
old
they
are
or
how
much
money
they
have
education
was
the
gateway
to
opportunity
for
me
it
was
the
gateway
for
it
was
it
was
the
gateway
for
most
of
you
and
now
more
than
ever
it
is
the
gateway
to
life
for
the
first
time
in
generation
nearly
every
state
has
answered
our
call
to
raise
their
standards
for
teaching
and
learning
some
of
the
worst
schools
in
the
country
have
made
real
gains
in
math
and
reading
millions
of
students
are
paying
less
for
college
today
because
we
finally
took
on
system
that
wasted
billions
of
taxpayer
dollars
on
banks
and
lenders
and
now
you
have
choice
we
can
gut
education
or
we
can
decide
that
in
the
united
states
of
america
no
child
should
have
her
dreams
deferred
because
of
crowded
classroom
or
crumbling
school
no
family
should
have
to
set
aside
college
acceptance
letter
because
they
do
have
the
money
no
company
should
have
to
look
for
workers
overseas
because
they
could
find
any
with
the
right
skills
here
at
home
that
not
our
future
that
is
not
our
future
government
has
role
in
this
but
teachers
must
inspire
principals
must
lead
parents
must
thirst
for
learning
and
students
you
got
to
do
the
work
and
together
promise
you
we
can
and
any
nation
on
earth
so
help
me
help
me
recruit
hundred
thousand
math
and
science
teachers
within
years
and
improve
early
childhood
education
help
give
two
million
workers
the
chance
to
learn
skills
at
their
community
college
that
will
lead
directly
to
job
help
us
work
with
colleges
and
universities
to
cut
in
half
the
growth
of
tuition
costs
over
the
next
years
we
can
meet
that
goal
together
you
can
choose
that
future
for
america
that
our
future
you
know
in
world
of
new
threats
and
new
challenges
you
can
choose
leadership
that
has
been
tested
and
proven
four
years
ago
promised
to
end
the
war
in
iraq
we
did
promised
to
refocus
on
the
terrorists
who
actually
attacked
us
on
and
we
have
we
blunted
the
momentum
in
and
in
our
longest
war
will
be
over
new
tower
rises
above
the
new
york
skyline
is
on
the
path
to
defeat
and
bin
laden
is
dead
and
tonight
we
pay
tribute
to
the
americans
who
still
serve
in
harm
way
we
are
forever
in
debt
to
generation
whose
sacrifice
has
made
this
country
safer
and
more
respected
we
will
never
forget
you
and
so
long
as
we
will
sustain
the
strongest
military
the
world
has
ever
known
when
you
take
off
the
uniform
we
will
serve
you
as
well
as
you
served
us
because
no
one
who
fights
for
this
country
should
have
to
fight
for
job
or
roof
over
their
heads
or
the
care
that
they
need
when
they
come
home
around
the
world
we
strengthened
old
alliances
and
forged
new
coalitions
to
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
we
reasserted
our
power
across
the
pacific
and
stood
up
to
china
on
behalf
of
our
workers
from
burma
to
libya
to
south
sudan
we
have
advanced
the
rights
and
dignity
of
all
human
beings
men
and
women
and
muslims
and
jews
but
for
all
the
progress
that
we
made
challenges
remain
terrorist
plots
must
be
disrupted
europe
crisis
must
be
contained
our
commitment
to
israel
security
must
not
waver
and
neither
must
our
pursuit
of
peace
the
iranian
government
must
face
world
that
stays
united
against
its
nuclear
ambitions
the
historic
change
sweeping
across
the
arab
world
must
be
defined
not
by
the
iron
fist
of
dictator
or
the
hate
of
extremists
but
by
the
hopes
and
aspirations
of
ordinary
people
who
are
reaching
for
the
same
rights
that
we
celebrate
here
today
so
now
we
have
choice
my
opponent
and
his
running
mate
are
new
to
foreign
policy
but
from
all
that
we
seen
and
heard
they
want
to
take
us
back
to
an
era
of
blustering
and
blundering
that
cost
america
so
dearly
after
all
you
do
call
russia
our
number
one
not
russia
unless
you
still
stuck
in
cold
war
mind
warp
you
might
not
be
ready
for
diplomacy
with
beijing
if
you
visit
the
olympics
without
insulting
our
closest
ally
my
opponent
my
opponent
said
that
it
was
tragic
to
end
the
war
in
iraq
and
he
tell
us
how
he
end
the
war
in
well
have
and
will
and
while
my
opponent
would
spend
more
money
on
military
hardware
that
our
joint
chiefs
do
even
want
will
use
the
money
we
no
longer
spending
on
war
to
pay
down
our
debt
and
put
more
people
back
to
work
rebuilding
roads
and
bridges
and
schools
and
runways
because
after
two
wars
that
have
cost
us
thousands
of
lives
and
over
trillion
dollars
it
time
to
do
some
nation
building
right
here
at
home
you
can
choose
future
where
we
reduce
our
deficit
without
sticking
it
to
the
middle
class
independent
experts
say
that
my
plan
would
cut
our
deficit
by
four
trillion
dollars
and
last
summer
worked
with
republicans
in
congress
to
cut
billion
dollars
in
spending
because
those
of
us
who
believe
government
can
be
force
for
good
should
work
harder
than
anyone
to
reform
it
so
that
it
leaner
and
more
efficient
and
more
responsive
to
the
american
people
want
to
reform
the
tax
code
so
it
simple
fair
and
asks
the
wealthiest
households
to
pay
higher
taxes
on
incomes
over
dollars
the
same
rate
we
had
when
bill
was
president
the
same
rate
we
had
when
our
economy
created
nearly
million
new
jobs
the
biggest
surplus
in
history
and
whole
lot
of
millionaires
to
boot
now
still
eager
to
reach
an
agreement
based
on
the
principles
of
my
bipartisan
debt
commission
no
party
has
monopoly
on
wisdom
no
democracy
works
without
compromise
want
to
get
this
done
and
we
can
get
it
done
but
when
governor
and
his
friends
in
congress
tell
us
we
can
somehow
lower
our
deficits
by
spending
trillions
more
on
new
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthy
well
what
bill
call
it
you
do
the
arithmetic
you
do
the
math
refuse
to
go
along
with
that
and
as
long
as
president
never
will
refuse
to
ask
families
to
give
up
their
deductions
for
owning
home
or
raising
their
kids
just
to
pay
for
another
millionaire
tax
cut
refuse
to
ask
students
to
pay
more
for
college
or
kick
children
out
of
head
start
programs
to
eliminate
health
insurance
for
millions
of
americans
who
are
poor
and
elderly
or
disabled
all
so
those
with
the
most
can
pay
less
not
going
along
with
that
and
will
never
will
never
turn
into
voucher
no
american
should
ever
have
to
spend
their
golden
years
at
the
mercy
of
insurance
companies
they
should
retire
with
the
care
and
the
dignity
that
they
have
earned
yes
we
will
reform
and
strengthen
for
the
long
haul
but
we
do
it
by
reducing
the
cost
of
health
care
not
by
asking
seniors
to
pay
thousands
of
dollars
more
and
we
will
keep
the
promise
of
social
security
by
taking
the
responsible
steps
to
strengthen
it
not
by
turning
it
over
to
wall
street
this
is
the
choice
we
now
face
this
is
what
the
election
comes
down
to
over
and
over
we
been
told
by
our
opponents
that
bigger
tax
cuts
and
fewer
regulations
are
the
only
way
that
since
government
do
everything
it
should
do
almost
nothing
if
you
afford
health
insurance
hope
that
you
do
get
sick
if
company
releases
toxic
pollution
into
the
air
your
children
breathe
well
that
the
price
of
progress
if
you
afford
to
start
business
or
go
to
college
take
my
opponent
advice
and
borrow
money
from
your
parents
you
know
what
that
not
who
we
are
that
not
what
this
country
about
as
americans
we
believe
we
are
endowed
by
our
creator
with
certain
inalienable
rights
rights
that
no
man
or
government
can
take
away
we
insist
on
personal
responsibility
and
we
celebrate
individual
initiative
we
not
entitled
to
success
we
have
to
earn
it
we
the
the
dreamers
the
the
entrepreneurs
who
have
always
been
the
driving
force
behind
our
free
enterprise
system
the
greatest
engine
of
growth
and
prosperity
that
the
world
ever
known
but
we
also
believe
in
something
called
citizenship
citizenship
word
at
the
very
heart
of
our
founding
word
at
the
very
essence
of
our
democracy
the
idea
that
this
country
only
works
when
we
accept
certain
obligations
to
one
another
and
to
future
generations
we
believe
that
when
pays
his
enough
to
buy
the
cars
that
they
build
the
whole
company
does
better
we
believe
that
when
family
can
no
longer
be
tricked
into
signing
mortgage
they
afford
that
family
protected
but
so
is
the
value
of
other
people
homes
and
so
is
the
entire
economy
we
believe
the
little
girl
who
offered
an
escape
from
poverty
by
great
teacher
or
grant
for
college
could
become
the
next
jobs
or
the
scientist
who
cures
cancer
or
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
in
our
power
to
give
her
that
chance
we
know
that
churches
and
charities
can
often
make
more
of
difference
than
poverty
program
alone
we
do
want
handouts
for
people
who
refuse
to
help
themselves
and
we
certainly
do
want
for
banks
that
break
the
rules
we
do
think
the
government
can
solve
all
of
our
problems
but
we
do
think
the
government
is
the
source
of
all
of
our
problems
any
more
than
our
welfare
recipients
or
corporations
or
unions
or
immigrants
or
gays
or
any
other
group
we
told
to
blame
for
our
troubles
because
because
america
we
understand
that
this
democracy
is
ours
we
the
people
that
we
have
responsibilities
as
well
as
rights
that
our
destinies
are
bound
together
that
freedom
which
asks
only
what
in
it
for
me
freedom
without
commitment
to
others
freedom
without
love
or
charity
or
duty
or
patriotism
is
unworthy
of
our
founding
ideals
and
those
who
died
in
their
as
citizens
we
understand
that
america
is
not
about
what
can
be
done
for
us
it
about
what
can
be
done
by
us
together
through
the
hard
and
frustrating
but
necessary
work
of
that
what
we
believe
so
you
see
the
election
four
years
ago
was
about
me
it
was
about
you
my
fellow
citizens
you
were
the
change
you
the
reason
there
little
girl
with
heart
disorder
in
phoenix
who
get
the
surgery
she
needs
because
an
insurance
company
limit
her
coverage
you
did
that
you
the
reason
young
man
in
who
never
thought
he
be
able
to
afford
his
dream
of
earning
medical
degree
is
about
to
get
that
chance
you
made
that
possible
you
the
reason
young
immigrant
who
grew
up
here
and
went
to
school
here
and
pledged
allegiance
to
our
flag
will
no
longer
be
deported
from
the
only
country
she
ever
called
home
why
selfless
soldiers
be
kicked
out
of
the
military
because
of
who
they
are
or
who
they
love
why
thousands
of
families
have
finally
been
able
to
say
to
the
loved
ones
who
served
us
so
bravely
welcome
home
welcome
home
you
did
that
you
did
that
you
did
that
if
you
turn
away
now
if
you
turn
away
now
if
you
buy
into
the
cynicism
that
the
change
we
fought
for
is
possible
well
change
will
not
happen
if
you
give
up
on
the
idea
that
your
voice
can
make
difference
then
other
voices
will
fill
the
void
the
lobbyists
and
special
interests
the
people
with
the
million
dollar
checks
who
are
trying
to
buy
this
election
and
those
who
are
trying
to
make
it
harder
for
you
to
vote
washington
politicians
who
want
to
decide
who
you
can
marry
or
control
health
care
choices
that
women
should
be
making
for
themselves
only
you
can
make
sure
that
does
happen
only
you
have
the
power
to
move
us
forward
you
know
that
times
have
changed
since
first
spoke
to
this
convention
times
have
changed
and
so
have
no
longer
just
candidate
the
president
and
that
means
know
what
it
means
to
send
young
americans
into
battle
for
held
in
my
arms
the
mothers
and
fathers
of
those
who
did
return
shared
the
pain
of
families
who
lost
their
homes
and
the
frustration
of
workers
who
lost
their
jobs
if
the
critics
are
right
that
made
all
my
decisions
based
on
polls
then
must
not
be
very
good
at
reading
them
and
while
very
proud
of
what
we
achieved
together
far
more
mindful
of
my
own
failings
knowing
exactly
what
lincoln
meant
when
he
said
have
been
driven
to
my
knees
many
times
by
the
overwhelming
conviction
that
had
no
place
else
to
go
but
as
stand
here
tonight
have
never
been
more
hopeful
about
america
not
because
think
have
all
the
answers
not
because
naive
about
the
magnitude
of
our
challenges
hopeful
because
of
you
the
young
woman
met
at
science
fair
who
won
national
recognition
for
her
biology
research
while
living
with
her
family
at
homeless
shelter
she
gives
me
hope
the
auto
worker
who
won
the
lottery
after
his
plant
almost
closed
but
kept
coming
to
work
every
day
and
bought
flags
for
his
whole
town
and
one
of
the
cars
that
he
built
to
surprise
his
wife
he
gives
me
hope
the
family
business
in
that
did
lay
off
single
one
of
their
employees
when
the
recession
hit
even
when
their
competitors
shut
down
dozens
of
plants
even
when
it
meant
the
owner
gave
up
some
perks
and
some
pay
because
they
understood
that
their
biggest
asset
was
the
community
and
the
workers
who
had
helped
build
that
business
they
give
me
hope
think
about
the
young
sailor
met
at
reed
hospital
still
recovering
from
grenade
attack
that
would
cause
him
to
have
his
leg
amputated
above
the
knee
and
six
months
ago
we
would
watch
him
walk
into
white
house
dinner
those
who
served
in
iran
iraq
tall
and
pounds
heavier
dashing
in
his
uniform
with
big
grin
on
his
face
sturdy
on
his
new
leg
and
remember
how
few
months
after
that
would
watch
him
on
bicycle
racing
with
his
fellow
wounded
warriors
on
sparkling
spring
day
inspiring
other
who
had
just
begun
the
hard
path
he
had
he
gives
me
hope
he
gives
me
hope
do
know
what
party
these
men
and
women
belong
to
do
know
if
they
vote
for
me
but
know
that
their
spirit
defines
us
they
remind
me
in
the
words
of
scripture
that
ours
is
future
filled
with
hope
and
if
you
share
that
faith
with
me
if
you
share
that
hope
with
me
ask
you
tonight
for
your
vote
if
you
reject
the
notion
that
this
nation
promise
is
reserved
for
the
few
your
voice
must
be
heard
in
this
election
if
you
reject
the
notion
that
our
government
is
forever
beholden
to
the
highest
bidder
you
need
to
stand
up
in
this
election
if
you
believe
that
new
plants
and
factories
can
dot
our
landscape
that
new
energy
can
power
our
future
that
new
schools
can
provide
ladders
of
opportunity
to
this
nation
of
dreamers
if
you
believe
in
country
where
everyone
gets
fair
shot
and
everyone
does
their
fair
share
and
everyone
plays
by
the
same
rules
then
need
you
to
vote
this
november
america
never
said
this
journey
would
be
easy
and
promise
that
now
yes
our
path
is
harder
but
it
leads
to
better
place
yes
our
road
is
longer
but
we
travel
it
together
we
do
turn
back
we
leave
no
one
behind
we
pull
each
other
up
we
draw
strength
from
our
victories
and
we
learn
from
our
mistakes
but
we
keep
our
eyes
fixed
on
that
distant
horizon
knowing
that
providence
is
with
us
and
that
we
are
surely
blessed
to
be
citizens
of
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
these
united
states

our
hearts
still
ache
over
the
tragedy
in
aurora
yesterday
was
in
aurora
with
families
whose
loss
is
hard
to
imagine
with
the
wounded
who
are
fighting
to
recover
with
community
and
military
base
in
the
midst
of
their
grief
and
they
told
me
of
the
loved
ones
they
lost
and
here
today
it
fitting
to
recall
those
who
wore
our
nation

three
navy
tours
whose
family
and
friends
will
always
know
that

that
he
gave
his
own
life
to
save
another
these
young
patriots
were
willing
to
serve
in
faraway
lands
yet
they
were
taken
from
us
here
at
home
and
yesterday
conveyed
to
their
families
message
on
behalf
of
all
americans
we
your
loved
ones
we
salute
their
service
and
as
you
summon
the
strength
to
carry
on

keep
bright
their
legacy
we
stand
with
you
as
one

of
foreign
wars
in

see
the
same
shining
values

virtues
that
make
america
great
when
our
was
bombed
and
fascism
was
on
the
march
when
the
fighting
raged
in
korea
and
when
our
country
was
attacked
on
that
clear
september
morning
when
our
forces
were
sent
to
iraq
you
answered
your
call
because
you
know
what
americans
must
always
remember

there
are
patriots

all
days

american
goes
missing
or
is
taken
prisoner

must
do
everything
in
our
power
to
bring
them
home
even
after
you
took
off
the
uniform
you
never
stopped
serving
you
took
care
of
each
other
fighting
for
the
benefits
and
care
you
had
earned
and
taken
care
of
the
generations
that
followed

our
newest

course
some
among
you
our
veterans
always
receive
that
thanks
at
least
not
on
time
this
past
memorial
day
joined
some
of
you
at
the
wall
to
begin
the
anniversary
of
the
war
and
it
was
another
chance
to
say
what
should
have
been
said
all
along
you
did
your
duty
and
you
made
us
proud
and
as
this
anniversary
continues
ask
all
our
vets
to
stand
or
raise
your
hand
as
we
say
thank
you
and
welcome
home
every
generation
among
you
served
to
keep
us
strong
and
free
and
it
falls
to
us
those
that
follow
to
preserve
what
you
won
four
years
ago
stood
before
you
at
time
of
great
challenge
for
our
nation
we
were
engaged
in
two
wars
was
entrenched
in
their
safe
havens
in
pakistan
many
of
our
alliances
were
frayed
our
standing
in
the
world
had
suffered
we
were
in
the
worst
recession
of
our
lifetimes
around
the
world
some
questioned
whether
the
united
states
still
had
the
capacity
to
lead
so
four
years
ago
made
you
promise
pledged
to
take
the
fight
to
our
enemies
and
renew
our
leadership
in
the
world
as
president
what
done
and
as
you
reflect
on
recent
years
as
we
look
ahead
to
the
challenges
we
face
as
nation
and
the
leadership
required
you
just
have
my
words
you
have
my
deeds
you
have
my
track
record
you
have
the
promises
made
and
the
promises
that
kept
pledged
to
end
the
war
in
iraq
and
what
done
after
took
office
we
removed
nearly
troops
from
iraq
and
some
said
that
bringing
our
troops
home
last
year
was
mistake
they
would
have
kept
tens
of
thousands
of
our
forces
in
iraq
indefinitely
without
clear
mission
well
when
you
owe
the
troops
plan
you
owe
the
country
plan
and
that
includes
not
just
when
to
begin
wars
but
also
how
to
end
them
so
we
brought
our
troops
home
responsibly
they
left
with
their
heads
held
high
knowing
they
gave
iraqis
chance
to
forge
their
own
future
and
today
there
are
no
americans
fighting
in
iraq
and
we
are
proud
of
all
the
americans
who
served
there
pledged
to
make
it
priority
to
take
out
the
terrorists
who
had
attacked
us
on
and
as
candidate
said
that
if
we
had
bin
laden
in
our
sights
we
would
act
to
keep
america
safe
even
if
it
meant
going
into
pakistan
some
of
you
remember
at
the
time
that
comment
drew
quite
bit
of
criticism
but
since
took
office
worked
with
our
allies
and
our
partners
to
take
out
more
top
leaders
than
any
time
since
and
thanks
to
the
courage
and
the
skill
of
our
forces
bin
laden
will
never
threaten
america
again
and
is
on
the
road
to
defeat
pledged
to
finish
the
job
in
after
years
of
drift
we
had
to
break
the
momentum
of
the
and
build
up
the
capacity
and
the
capability
of
afghans
and
so
working
with
our
commanders
we
came
up
with
new
strategy
and
we
ordered
additional
forces
to
get
the
job
done
this
is
still
tough
fight
but
thanks
to
the
incredible
services
and
sacrifices
of
our
troops
we
pushed
the
back
training
afghan
forces
begun
the
transition
to
afghan
lead
again
there
are
those
who
argued
against
for
ending
this
war
or
against
talking
about
it
publicly
but
you
know
what
not
plan
for
security
either
after
years
of
war
and
given
the
progress
made
felt
it
was
important
that
the
american
people
and
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
know
our
plan
to
end
this
war
responsibly
and
so
by
the
end
of
this
summer
more
than
of
our
troops
will
have
come
home
next
year
afghans
will
take
the
lead
for
their
own
security
in
the
transition
will
be
complete
and
even
as
our
troops
come
home
have
strong
partnership
with
the
afghan
people
and
we
will
stay
vigilant
so
is
never
again
source
for
attacks
against
america
not
just
ending
these
wars
doing
it
in
way
that
achieves
our
objectives
moreover
allowed
us
to
broaden
our
vision
and
begin
new
era
of
american
leadership
leading
from
europe
to
the
asia
pacific
with
alliances
that
have
never
been
stronger
leading
the
fight
against
nuclear
dangers
applied
the
strongest
sanctions
ever
on
iran
and
north
korea
nations
that
can
not
be
allowed
to
threaten
the
world
with
nuclear
weapons
leading
on
behalf
of
freedom
standing
with
people
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
as
they
demand
their
rights
protecting
the
libyan
people
as
they
rid
the
world
of
today
also
working
for
transition
so
the
syrian
people
can
have
better
future
free
of
the
regime
and
given
the
stockpiles
of
chemical
weapons
we
will
continue
to
make
it
clear
to
and
those
around
him
that
the
world
is
watching
and
that
they
will
be
held
accountable
by
the
international
community
and
the
united
states
should
they
make
the
tragic
mistake
of
using
those
weapons
and
we
will
continue
to
work
with
our
friends
and
our
allies
and
the
syrian
opposition
on
behalf
of
the
day
when
the
syrian
people
have
government
that
respects
their
basic
rights
to
live
in
peace
and
freedom
and
dignity
because
leading
around
the
world
people
have
new
attitude
toward
america
more
confidence
in
our
leadership
we
see
it
everywhere
we
go
we
saw
it
as
grateful
libyans
waved
american
flags
we
see
it
across
the
globe
when
people
are
asked
which
country
do
you
admire
the
most
one
nation
comes
out
on
top
the
united
states
of
america
so
this
is
the
progress
that
made
thanks
to
the
extraordinary
service
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
winding
down
decade
of
war
destroying
the
terrorist
network
that
attacked
us
strengthening
the
alliances
that
extend
our
values
and
today
every
american
can
be
proud
that
the
united
states
is
safer
and
stronger
and
more
respected
in
the
world
and
all
this
allows
us
to
another
promise
that
made
to
you
four
years
ago
strengthening
our
military
after
years
of
operations
our
soldiers
will
now
have
fewer
and
shorter
deployments
which
means
more
time
on
the
home
front
to
keep
their
families
strong
more
time
to
heal
from
the
wounds
of
war
more
time
to
improve
readiness
and
prepare
for
future
threats
as
president
continued
to
make
historic
investments
to
keep
our
armed
forces
strong
and
guided
by
our
new
strategy
we
will
maintain
our
military
superiority
it
will
be
second
to
none
as
long
as
am
president
and
well
into
the
future
got
the
military
in
history
and
as
am
going
to
keep
it
that
way
and
by
the
way
given
all
the
rhetoric
lately
it
is
political
season
also
set
the
record
straight
on
the
budget
those
big
cuts
including
that
congress
said
would
occur
next
year
if
they
reach
deal
to
reduce
the
deficit
understand
first
of
all
no
reason
that
should
happen
because
people
in
congress
ought
to
be
able
to
come
together
and
agree
on
plan
balanced
approach
that
reduces
the
deficit
and
keeps
our
military
strong
it
should
be
done
and
there
are
number
of
republicans
in
congress
who
want
you
to
know
that
most
of
them
voted
for
these
cuts
now
trying
to
wriggle
out
of
what
they
agreed
to
instead
of
making
tough
choices
to
reduce
the
deficit
rather
protect
tax
cuts
for
some
of
the
wealthiest
americans
even
if
it
risks
big
cuts
in
our
military
and
got
to
tell
you
disagree
if
the
choice
is
between
tax
cuts
that
the
wealthiest
americans
need
and
funding
our
troops
that
they
definitely
need
to
keep
our
country
strong
will
stand
with
our
troops
every
single
time
so
stop
playing
politics
with
our
military
get
serious
and
reduce
our
deficit
and
keep
our
military
strong
take
some
of
the
money
that
saving
because
not
fighting
in
iraq
and
because
winding
down
in
use
half
that
money
to
pay
down
our
deficit
use
half
of
it
to
do
some
here
in
the
united
states
of
america
keep
taking
care
of
our
extraordinary
military
families
for
the
first
time
ever
made
military
families
and
veterans
top
priority
not
just
at
not
just
at
the
but
across
the
government
as
mentioned
this
has
been
mission
for
my
wife
and
vice
president
wife
today
more
people
across
america
in
every
segment
of
society
are
joining
forces
to
give
our
military
families
the
respect
and
the
support
that
they
deserve
and
another
way
we
can
those
who
serve
it
may
no
longer
be
crime
for
con
artists
to
pass
themselves
off
as
but
one
thing
is
certain
it
is
contemptible
so
this
week
we
will
launch
new
website
living
memorial
so
the
american
people
can
see
been
awarded
our
highest
honors
because
no
american
hero
should
ever
have
their
stolen
this
leads
me
to
another
promise
made
four
years
ago
upholding
sacred
trust
with
our
veterans
promised
to
strengthen
the
and
that
promise
has
been
kept
in
my
first
year
we
achieved
the
largest
percentage
increase
in
the
budget
in
years
and
going
to
keep
making
historic
investments
in
our
veterans
when
came
to
the
oval
office
we
talked
about
what
those
automatic
budget
cuts
sequestration
could
mean
for
the
so
my
administration
has
made
it
clear
your
benefits
are
exempt
from
sequestration
they
are
exempt
and
because
advance
appropriations
is
now
the
law
of
the
land
veterans
health
care
is
protected
from
the
budget
battles
in
washington
promised
you
that
stand
up
for
veterans
health
care
as
long
as
president
will
not
allow
health
care
to
be
turned
into
voucher
system
subject
to
the
whims
of
the
insurance
market
some
have
argued
for
this
plan
could
not
disagree
more
you
need
vouchers
you
need
the
health
care
that
you
have
earned
and
that
you
depend
on
so
made
dramatic
investments
to
help
care
for
our
veterans
for
our
veterans
we
declared
that
more
illnesses
are
now
presumed
connected
to
your
exposure
to
agent
orange
as
result
of
our
decision
vets
and
your
families
received
nearly
billion
dollars
in
disability
pay
you
needed
it
you
fought
for
it
we
heard
you
and
we
got
it
done
added
mobile
clinics
for
our
rural
veterans
more
tailored
care
for
our
women
veterans
unprecedented
support
for
veterans
with
traumatic
brain
injury
all
tolled
made
health
care
available
to
nearly
veterans
who
have
it
before
and
now
supporting
and
families
with
the
skills
and
the
stipends
to
help
care
for
the
veterans
that
they
love
of
course
more
veterans
in
the
system
means
more
claims
so
hired
thousands
of
claims
processors
investing
in
paperless
systems
to
their
credit
the
dedicated
folks
at
the
are
now
completing
one
million
claims
year
but
been
tidal
wave
of
new
claims
and
when
hear
about
veterans
waiting
months
or
years
for
your
benefits
it
is
unacceptable
and
we
are
doing
something
about
it
taking
all
those
folks
who
processed
your
agent
orange
claims
more
than
experts
and
giving
them
new
mission
attack
the
backlog
veterans
with
the
most
serious
disabilities
and
the
and
will
work
harder
towards
seamless
transition
so
new
veterans
just
piled
on
to
the
backlog
and
we
will
not
rest
will
not
be
satisfied
until
we
get
this
right
and
today
also
calling
on
all
those
who
help
our
vets
complete
their
claims
state
physicians
and
veteran
groups
like
the
to
join
us
you
know
how
this
can
work
better
so
get
it
done
together
also
focused
on
the
urgent
needs
of
our
veterans
with
poured
tremendous
resources
into
this
fight
thousands
of
more
and
more
clinicians
more
care
and
more
treatment
and
we
made
it
easier
for
veterans
with
to
qualify
for
benefits
but
after
decade
of
war
now
an
epidemic
losing
more
troops
to
suicide
one
every
single
day
than
we
are
in
combat
according
to
some
estimates
about
veterans
are
taking
their
lives
each
day
more
every
year
than
all
the
troops
killed
in
iraq
and
combined
that
tragedy
it
heartbreaking
it
should
not
be
happening
in
the
united
states
of
america
so
when
hear
about
and
veterans
who
had
the
courage
to
seek
help
but
get
it
who
died
waiting
that
an
outrage
and
told
secretary
chairman
and
secretary
got
to
do
better
this
has
to
be
all
hands
on
deck
so
our
message
to
everyone
ever
worn
the
uniform
if
hurting
not
sign
of
weakness
to
seek
help
sign
of
strength
and
when
you
do
be
there
and
do
more
to
help
including
more
and
clinicians
to
help
you
heal
we
need
to
end
this
tragedy
and
we
going
to
work
together
to
make
it
happen
so
too
with
our
campaign
to
end
homelessness
among
our
veterans
now
helped
to
bring
tens
of
thousands
of
veterans
off
the
streets
and
into
permanent
housing
this
has
to
be
core
mission
because
every
veteran
who
has
fought
for
america
ought
to
have
home
in
america
and
this
brings
me
to
the
last
promise
want
to
discuss
with
you
four
years
ago
said
that
do
everything
could
to
help
our
veterans
the
american
dream
to
enlist
you
in
building
stronger
america
after
all
our
veterans
have
the
skills
that
america
needs
so
today
our
economy
is
growing
and
creating
jobs
but
still
too
hard
for
too
many
folks
to
find
work
especially
our
younger
veterans
our
veterans
from
iraq
and
and
with
million
more
troops
rejoining
civilian
life
in
the
years
ahead
and
looking
for
work
got
to
step
up
our
game
at
every
stage
of
their
careers
so
today
announcing
major
overhaul
of
our
transition
assistance
program
going
to
set
up
kind
of
reverse
boot
camp
for
our
departing
starting
this
year
get
more
assistance
as
they
plan
their
careers
provide
the
training
they
need
to
find
that
job
or
pursue
that
education
or
start
that
business
and
just
as
maintained
their
military
readiness
have
new
standards
of
career
readiness
in
addition
by
making
the
bill
priority
helped
more
than
veterans
and
their
families
pursue
their
education
and
issued
an
executive
order
to
help
put
stop
to
schools
that
are
ripping
off
our
veterans
directed
the
federal
government
to
step
up
on
jobs
since
took
office
hired
more
than
veterans
into
the
federal
government
we
made
it
priority
and
keeping
track
every
agency
every
department
what
are
you
doing
for
our
veterans
challenged
community
health
to
hire
thousands
of
veterans
as
physicians
and
nurses
and
as
we
help
local
communities
hire
new
police
officers
and
firefighters
and
first
responders
giving
preference
to
veterans
also
fighting
to
get
more
vets
hired
in
the
private
sector
with
new
tools
like
our
veterans
jobs
bank
connecting
veterans
directly
to
jobs
helping
thousands
of
veterans
get
certified
for
jobs
in
manufacturing
we
succeeded
in
passing
tax
credits
for
businesses
that
hire
our
veterans
and
our
wounded
warriors
and
this
morning
signed
into
law
the
veteran
skills
to
jobs
act
making
it
easier
for
veterans
to
transfer
their
outstanding
military
skills
into
the
licenses
and
credentials
they
need
to
get
civilian
jobs
if
you
are
young
man
that
is
in
charge
of
platoon
or
millions
of
dollars
of
equipment
and
are
taking
responsibility
or
medic
out
in
the
field
who
is
saving
lives
every
single
day
when
you
come
home
you
need
to
be
and
certified
quickly
so
you
can
get
on
the
job
people
should
understand
how
skilled
you
are
and
there
be
bureaucrats
or
got
to
put
those
folks
to
work
last
summer
also
challenged
the
private
sector
to
hire
or
train
veterans
or
their
spouses
and
have
been
leading
the
effort
through
joining
forces
and
so
far
thousands
of
patriotic
businesses
have
hired
or
trained
more
than
veterans
and
spouses
and
our
message
to
companies
is
simple
if
you
want
somebody
who
gets
the
job
done
then
hire
vet
hire
vet
hire
vet
and
they
will
make
you
proud
just
like
made
america
proud
and
fighting
for
veterans
who
want
to
start
their
own
businesses
including
more
training
in
entrepreneurship
one
of
the
reasons
cut
taxes
times
for
small
businesses
including
businesses
and
the
effects
ripple
out
because
vets
are
more
likely
to
hire
vets
so
today
we
can
point
to
progress
more
veterans
are
finding
jobs
the
unemployment
rate
for
veterans
has
come
down
yes
still
too
high
but
coming
down
and
now
got
to
sustain
that
momentum
one
of
the
reasons
proposed
to
congress
veterans
jobs
corps
to
put
our
veterans
back
to
work
protecting
and
rebuilding
america
and
today
am
again
calling
on
congress
pass
this
veterans
jobs
corps
and
extend
the
tax
credits
for
businesses
that
hire
veterans
so
we
can
give
these
american
the
jobs
and
opportunities
that
they
deserve
so
these
are
the
promises
that
made
these
are
the
promises
that
kept
where
we
still
have
more
to
do
we
will
not
rest
my
vow
to
you
got
your
back
got
your
six
because
we
have
solemn
obligation
to
all
who
serve
not
just
for
the
years
in
uniform
but
for
all
the
decades
that
follow
and
because
even
though
wars
are
ending
the
hard
work
of
taking
care
of
our
newest
veterans
has
only
just
begun
just
as
you
protected
america
going
to
pass
our
country
to
the
next
generation
stronger
and
safer
and
more
respected
in
the
world
so
if
anyone
tries
to
tell
you
that
our
greatness
has
passed
that
america
is
in
decline
you
tell
them
this
just
like
the
century
the
is
going
to
be
another
great
american
century
for
we
are
americans
blessed
with
the
greatest
form
of
government
ever
devised
by
man
democracy
dedicated
to
freedom
and
committed
to
the
ideals
that

will
never

our
way
of
life

will
never
waver
in
its

are
nation
that
freed
millions
and
turned
adversaries
into
allies

are
the
americans

aggression
we
are
americans
who
welcome
our
global
responsibilities
and
our
global
leadership

one
indispensable
nation
in
world
affairs
and
you

are
the
soldiers

sailors

airmen

marines
and
the
coast
guardsmen
who
have
kept
us
strong
we
will

legacy
and
we
will
ensure
that
the
military

god

the
united
states
of
america
let
me
first
of
all
say
how
grateful
am
for
all
of
you
being
here
and
how
how
much
we
appreciate
everything
that
you
done
know
that
there
are
lot
of
people
here
who
have
been
so
engaged
in
the
campaign
have
sacrificed
so
much
people
who
been
involved
back
since
and
so
want
all
of
you
to
know
how
appreciative
am
and
know
many
of
you
came
here
today
for
campaign
event
was
looking
forward
to
having
fun
conversation
with
you
about
some
really
important
matters
that
we
face
as
country
and
the
differences
between
myself
and
my
opponent
in
this
election
but
this
morning
we
woke
up
to
news
of
tragedy
that
reminds
us
of
all
the
ways
that
we
are
united
as
one
american
family
by
now
many
of
you
know
many
of
you
have
heard
that
few
miles
outside
of
denver
in
town
call
aurora
at
least
people
were
killed
when
gunman
opened
fire
in
movie
and
dozens
more
are
being
treated
for
injuries
at
local
hospital
some
of
the
victims
are
being
treated
at
hospital
now
still
gathering
all
the
facts
about
what
happened
in
aurora
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
police
have
one
suspect
in
custody
and
the
federal
government
stands
ready
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
bring
whoever
is
responsible
for
this
heinous
crime
to
justice
and
we
will
take
every
step
possible
to
ensure
the
safety
of
all
of
our
people
we
going
to
stand
by
our
in
during
this
extraordinarily
difficult
time
and
had
chance
to
speak
with
the
mayor
of
aurora
as
well
as
the
governor
of
to
express
not
just
on
behalf
of
and
myself
but
the
entire
american
family
how
heartbroken
we
are
now
even
as
we
learn
how
this
happened
and
who
responsible
we
may
never
understand
what
leads
anybody
to
their
fellow
human
beings
like
this
such
violence
such
evil
is
senseless
it
beyond
reason
but
while
we
will
never
know
fully
what
causes
somebody
to
take
the
life
of
another
we
do
know
what
makes
life
worth
living
the
people
we
lost
in
aurora
loved
and
they
were
loved
they
were
mothers
and
fathers
they
were
husbands
and
wives
sisters
and
brothers
sons
and
daughters
friends
and
they
had
hopes
for
the
future
and
they
had
dreams
that
were
not
yet
fulfilled
and
if
anything
to
take
away
from
this
tragedy
the
reminder
that
life
is
very
fragile
our
time
here
is
limited
and
it
is
precious
and
what
matters
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
not
the
small
things
not
the
trivial
things
which
so
often
consume
us
and
our
daily
lives
ultimately
how
we
choose
to
treat
one
another
and
how
we
love
one
another
it
what
we
do
on
daily
basis
to
give
our
lives
meaning
and
to
give
our
lives
purpose
what
matters
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
remember
will
be
those
we
loved
and
what
we
did
for
others
why
here
sure
that
many
of
you
who
are
parents
here
had
the
same
reaction
that
did
when
heard
this
news
my
daughters
go
to
the
movies
what
if
and
had
been
at
the
as
so
many
of
our
kids
do
every
day
and
will
be
fortunate
enough
to
hug
our
girls
little
tighter
tonight
and
sure
you
will
do
the
same
with
your
children
but
for
those
parents
who
may
not
be
so
lucky
we
have
to
embrace
them
and
let
them
know
we
will
be
there
for
them
as
nation
so
again
am
so
grateful
that
all
of
you
are
here
am
so
moved
by
your
support
but
there
are
going
to
be
other
days
for
politics
this
think
is
day
for
prayer
and
reflection
for
so
so
what
ask
everybody
to
do
like
us
to
pause
in
moment
of
silence
for
the
victims
of
this
terrible
tragedy
for
the
people
who
knew
them
and
loved
them
for
those
who
are
still
struggling
to
recover
and
for
all
the
victims
of
less
acts
of
violence
that
plague
our
communities
every
single
day
so
if
everybody
can
just
take
moment
silence
observed
thank
you
everybody
hope
all
of
you
will
keep
the
people
of
aurora
in
your
hearts
and
minds
today
may
the
lord
bring
them
comfort
and
healing
in
hard
days
to
come
am
grateful
to
all
of
you
and
hope
that
as
consequence
of
events
as
as
you
leave
here
you
spend
little
time
thinking
about
the
incredible
blessings
that
god
has
given
us
thank
you
very
much
everybody
god
bless
you
god
bless
the
united
states
of
america
good
afternoon
earlier
today
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
affordable
care
act
the
name
of
the
health
care
reform
we
passed
two
years
ago
in
doing
so
they
reaffirmed
fundamental
principle
that
here
in
america
in
the
wealthiest
nation
on
earth
no
illness
or
accident
should
lead
to
any
financial
ruin
know
there
will
be
lot
of
discussion
today
about
the
politics
of
all
this
about
who
won
and
who
lost
how
these
things
tend
to
be
viewed
here
in
washington
but
that
discussion
completely
misses
the
point
whatever
the
politics
decision
was
victory
for
people
all
over
this
country
whose
lives
will
be
more
secure
because
of
this
law
and
the
supreme
decision
to
uphold
it
and
because
this
law
has
direct
impact
on
so
many
americans
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
talk
about
exactly
what
it
means
for
you
first
if
one
of
the
more
than
million
americans
who
already
have
health
insurance
you
will
keep
your
health
insurance
this
law
will
only
make
it
more
secure
and
more
affordable
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
impose
lifetime
limits
on
the
amount
of
care
you
receive
they
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
children
with
conditions
they
can
no
longer
drop
your
coverage
if
you
get
sick
they
can
no
longer
jack
up
your
premiums
without
reason
they
are
required
to
provide
free
preventive
care
like
and
provision
that
already
helped
million
americans
with
private
insurance
and
by
this
august
nearly
million
of
you
will
receive
rebate
from
your
insurance
company
because
it
spent
too
much
on
things
like
administrative
costs
and
bonuses
and
not
enough
on
your
health
care
more
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
young
adults
under
the
age
of
are
able
to
stay
on
their
parent
health
care
plans
provision
that
already
helped
million
young
americans
and
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
seniors
receive
discount
on
their
prescription
drugs
discount
that
already
saved
more
than
million
seniors
on
about
each
all
of
this
is
happening
because
of
the
affordable
care
act
these
provisions
provide
protections
for
middle
class
families
and
they
enjoy
broad
popular
support
and
thanks
to
decision
all
of
these
benefits
and
protections
will
continue
for
americans
who
already
have
health
insurance
now
if
one
of
the
million
americans
who
yet
have
health
insurance
starting
in
this
law
will
offer
you
an
array
of
quality
affordable
private
health
insurance
plans
to
choose
from
each
state
will
take
the
lead
in
designing
their
own
menu
of
options
and
if
states
can
come
up
with
even
better
ways
of
covering
more
people
at
the
same
quality
and
cost
this
law
allows
them
to
do
that
too
and
asked
congress
to
help
speed
up
that
process
and
give
states
this
flexibility
in
year
one
once
states
set
up
these
health
insurance
known
as
exchanges
insurance
companies
will
no
longer
be
able
to
discriminate
against
any
american
with
health
condition
they
be
able
to
charge
you
more
just
because
woman
they
be
able
to
bill
you
into
bankruptcy
if
sick
finally
have
the
same
chance
to
get
quality
affordable
health
care
as
everyone
else
and
if
you
afford
the
premiums
you
receive
credit
that
helps
pay
for
it
today
the
supreme
court
also
upheld
the
principle
that
people
who
can
afford
health
insurance
should
take
the
responsibility
to
buy
health
insurance
this
is
important
for
two
reasons
first
when
uninsured
people
who
can
afford
coverage
get
sick
and
show
up
at
the
emergency
room
for
care
the
rest
of
us
end
up
paying
for
their
care
in
the
form
of
higher
premiums
and
second
if
you
ask
insurance
companies
to
cover
people
with
conditions
but
require
people
who
can
afford
it
to
buy
their
own
insurance
some
folks
might
wait
until
sick
to
buy
the
care
they
need
which
would
also
drive
up
everybody
premiums
why
even
though
knew
it
be
politically
popular
and
resisted
the
idea
when
ran
for
this
office
we
ultimately
included
provision
in
the
affordable
care
act
that
people
who
can
afford
to
buy
health
insurance
should
take
the
responsibility
to
do
so
in
fact
this
idea
has
enjoyed
support
from
members
of
both
parties
including
the
current
republican
nominee
for
president
still
know
the
debate
over
this
law
has
been
divisive
respect
the
very
real
concerns
that
millions
of
americans
have
shared
and
know
lot
of
coverage
through
this
health
care
debate
has
focused
on
what
it
means
politically
well
it
should
be
pretty
clear
by
now
that
do
this
because
it
was
good
politics
did
it
because
believed
it
was
good
for
the
country
did
it
because
believed
it
was
good
for
the
american
people
framed
letter
that
hangs
in
my
office
right
now
it
was
sent
to
me
during
the
health
care
debate
by
woman
named
for
years
and
years
did
everything
right
she
bought
health
insurance
she
paid
her
premiums
on
time
but
years
ago
was
diagnosed
with
cancer
and
even
though
been
for
more
than
decade
her
insurance
company
kept
jacking
up
her
rates
year
after
year
and
despite
her
desire
to
keep
her
coverage
despite
her
fears
that
she
would
get
sick
again
she
had
to
surrender
her
health
insurance
and
was
forced
to
hang
her
fortunes
on
chance
carried
story
with
me
every
day
of
the
fight
to
pass
this
law
it
reminded
me
of
all
the
americans
all
across
the
country
who
have
had
to
worry
not
only
about
getting
sick
but
about
the
cost
of
getting
well
is
well
today
and
because
of
this
law
there
are
other
americans
other
sons
and
daughters
brothers
and
sisters
fathers
and
mothers
who
will
not
have
to
hang
their
fortunes
on
chance
these
are
the
americans
for
whom
we
passed
this
law
the
highest
court
in
the
land
has
now
spoken
we
will
continue
to
implement
this
law
and
we
work
together
to
improve
on
it
where
we
can
but
what
we
do
what
the
country
afford
to
do
is
the
political
battles
of
two
years
ago
or
go
back
to
the
way
things
were
with
announcement
time
for
us
to
move
forward
to
implement
and
where
necessary
improve
on
this
law
and
now
is
the
time
to
keep
our
focus
on
the
most
urgent
challenge
of
our
time
putting
people
back
to
work
paying
down
our
debt
and
building
an
economy
where
people
can
have
confidence
that
if
they
work
hard
they
can
get
ahead
but
today
as
confident
as
ever
that
when
we
look
back
five
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
be
better
off
because
we
had
the
courage
to
pass
this
law
and
keep
moving
forward
thank
you
god
bless
you
and
god
bless
america
