# Trump Speech Analysis
Various and sundry natural language assessments of Donald Trump's speech patterns. Not intended to be consistent or complete: just some fun comparisons between corpora. Not appropriate for scientific application. Perfectly appropriate for presidential mockery.

# Fun things I should do (feel free to add!)
  
  Tune up the Markov model (preferably with a larger corpus) and adjust the lookback to produce more reasonable sentences/ less straight up phrase replication.
  
  Clean up non-words in Obama corpus.
  
  Use a better metric than z-score frequency in the breakdowns and exclude words above a certain frequency in the general English corpus/ words that are used purely for syntactic structure in English and are unlikely to be very funny (the main goal of the entire enterprise).
